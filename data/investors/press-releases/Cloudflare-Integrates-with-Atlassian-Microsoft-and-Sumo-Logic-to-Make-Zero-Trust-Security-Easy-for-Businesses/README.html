			<i>New collaborations expand the reach of the Cloudflare One Zero Trust platform to where businesses need protection and support</i>

	<p><span class="bw-dateline-wrapper">SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>
		<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2F&amp;esheet=53361674&amp;newsitemid=20230314005467&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Cloudflare%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8d1940de73acbcb58310f0b707544a7a" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Cloudflare, Inc.</a> (NYSE: NET), the security, performance, and reliability company helping to build a better Internet, today announced new Zero Trust integrations with Atlassian, Microsoft, and Sumo Logic. These new integrations will help businesses of any size easily secure the tools and applications they rely on with enterprise-ready Zero Trust security. Now businesses will be able to use security insights from the Cloudflare One SASE platform across Atlassian’s Confluence and Jira Software products, to protect classified and labeled data by integrating with Microsoft Sensitivity Labels, and to accelerate threat detection and investigation in Sumo Logic’s Cloud SIEM – all in just a few clicks.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Today's CISOs are tasked with securing a complex matrix of applications, tools, and devices that inherently require a Zero Trust approach. That's why we continue to expand Cloudflare One to make it as seamless as possible, wherever they are in their security journey,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. “We want to make it as easy as clicking a button for companies to bring Zero Trust security everywhere their business needs it.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, the security landscape is filled with solutions that focus on specific, singular security challenges. Businesses are forced to integrate with dozens of offerings, making it harder to integrate Zero Trust security across all of a company’s websites, employee applications, and corporate networks. As a result of these deeper integrations, companies can now embed Zero Trust security insights more deeply into more of the tools and applications their business and employees rely on. Since its launch in 2020, Cloudflare One has provided over 10,000 companies worldwide with a unified platform to protect their company and employees anywhere–eliminating the need to cope with dozens of disconnected problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		With these new integrations, businesses can:

		“Preventing data breaches is a critical business need in today's threat landscape. Categorizing your sensitive data and ensuring it doesn't leave the enterprise are the two sides of data security,” said Hammad Rajjoub, Director, Product Marketing, Data Security, Compliance and Privacy Ecosystem at Microsoft. “Cloudflare has built integration with Microsoft Purview Information Protection to make this process seamless, providing CIO teams proactive security with in-depth defense and higher automation to deal with the changes around how we work.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“As a long time Cloudflare partner, we’ve worked together to help joint customers analyze events and trends from their websites and applications to provide end-to-end visibility and improve digital experiences,” said John Coyle, Vice President of Business Development at Sumo Logic. “We’re excited to expand this partnership to provide real-time insights into the Zero Trust security posture of mutual customers in Sumo Logic’s Cloud SIEM.”
