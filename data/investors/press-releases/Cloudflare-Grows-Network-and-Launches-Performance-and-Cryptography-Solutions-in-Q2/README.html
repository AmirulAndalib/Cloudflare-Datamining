<p>San Francisco, CA, July 11, 2019 — <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, a leading Internet security, performance, and reliability company, today announced that it protects and optimizes more than 18 million Internet properties as of the second quarter of 2019, an increase of more than two million from last quarter. This is made possible through Cloudflare’s global network, which spans more than 180 cities in 80 countries and counts approximately ten percent of the Fortune 1,000 as paying customers. </p>
<p>Cloudflare announced a number of partnerships in the second quarter of 2019. Tencent Cloud, one of the world’s leading providers of cloud computing and Internet value-added services, joined the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/">Bandwidth Alliance</a>. Now, joint customers of Cloudflare and Tencent Cloud pay zero data transfer fees for all traffic between their networks outside of China. Cloudflare also <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/analytics/">partnered with analytics platforms</a> such as Chronicle Security, Datadog, Elastic, Looker, Splunk, and Sumo Logic to enhance Internet performance and security analytics. Shared customers can now view security events and traffic trends from any of their Internet properties while combining Cloudflare logs with other data sources.</p>
<p>Cloudflare also <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2019/cloudflare-and-28-partner-organizations-celebrate-fifth-anniversary-of/">celebrated</a> the fifth anniversary of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo">Project Galileo</a> in June, an initiative that equips politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, at no cost. The Project protects nearly 600 vulnerable groups and works with 28 partner organizations.</p>
<p>“I’m proud that for the last five years we’ve protected some of the most vulnerable groups online from cyber attacks through Project Galileo,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. “Achieving our mission of helping to build a better Internet is only possible if the most at-risk groups online have access to the services necessary to make their voices heard.” </p>
<p>Cloudflare also teamed up with Google to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2019/cloudflare-launches-amp-real-url-to-give-publishers-and-site-owners-more/">launch</a> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/amp-real-url/">AMP Real URL</a>, a solution that gives publishers and site owners increased control over their brands, while simultaneously improving the speed and performance of mobile content. AMP Real URL enables browsers to natively display the canonical URL for publishers’ AMP content in the browser, with no additional coding required. </p>
