			Gateway™</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Cloudflare Access</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Cloudflare Access is a Zero Trust identity and access management
		solution that secures, authenticates, and monitors user access to ensure
		that employees and devices are who they say they are. To do this,
		Cloudflare is working with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fteams.cloudflare.com%2Faccess%2F&amp;esheet=52154110&amp;newsitemid=20200107005315&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=identity+providers&amp;index=5&amp;md5=4f557c7e4047900da02aa0835e9a3c09">identity
			providers</a>, including Okta, OneLogin, and Ping Identity. Cloudflare
		also works with major endpoint security providers, including VMware
		Carbon Black, Malwarebytes, and Tanium to ensure that users’ devices
		accessing applications have the latest protections and updates.
	</p>
	<p>
		With employees and contractors spread around the world, the traditional
		VPN model is slow, clunky and a pain to work with. As a result,
		employees often try to circumvent corporate VPNs, creating additional
		security risks for themselves and for their companies. Because Access is
		built on Cloudflare’s existing global network, which spans 200 cities in
		more than 90 countries, it sits within 100 milliseconds of nearly all of
		Cloudflare’s users. With this scale, Cloudflare can deliver an
		experience to teams that is safe and fast, no matter where they are in
		the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Cloudflare Gateway</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Cloudflare Gateway is a new solution being developed that will secure
		and filter outbound Internet traffic to protect employees from threats
		on the public Internet. Gateway will also ensure that Internet-browsing
		employees don’t bring malware or vulnerable code into the organization.
		Existing technologies can slow down the user experience or are not
		effective at stopping attacks. Gateway will instead keep employees and
		their devices safer online, without sacrificing performance. Cloudflare
		is also partnering with cloud networking partners including Ciphercloud
		and Cloudgenix to deliver these solutions to enterprises.
	</p>
	<p>
		Gateway will replace firewall appliances in offices, negate the need for
		new hardware, eliminate expensive MPLS fees, and deliver anti-malware
		scanning and software closer to the user, stopping threats before they
		hit the network.
	</p>
	<p>
		Three versions are in development that will be available:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="bwlistitemmargb">
			Gateway will include DNS-based filtering and audit logging
		</li>
		<li class="bwlistitemmargb">
			Gateway Pro will secure all Internet-bound traffic
		</li>
		<li class="bwlistitemmargb">
			Gateway Enterprise will deliver data loss prevention and include
			always-on browser isolation from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2Fpress-releases%2F2020%2Fcloudflare-acquires-s2-systems-corporation-for-next-gen-browser-isolation&amp;esheet=52154110&amp;newsitemid=20200107005315&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=newly-acquired+S2+Systems+Corporation&amp;index=6&amp;md5=b20f5a53343b1eb506d9c20c8a9cde4e">newly-acquired
				S2 Systems Corporation</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		“With the rise of SaaS, cloud, and an increasingly mobile workforce,
		existing security solutions don’t work for modern-day employees or their
		employers,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare.
		“Employees need to access their applications quickly and securely,
		browse the public Internet without threatening company security, and be
		able to do all of this no matter where they are. Cloudflare for Teams
		gives companies and their employees a better way to do work, without
		added inconvenience.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Benefits of Cloudflare for Teams include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="bwlistitemmargb">
			<b>Fast:</b> Cloudflare for Teams is built for speed from the ground
			up. Threat filtering runs on one of the world’s fastest DNS resolvers
			and delivers a VPN replacement that will improve performance, instead
			of slowing users down.
		</li>
		<li class="bwlistitemmargb">
			<b>Vast threat intelligence</b>: Cloudflare for Teams applies the
			threat intelligence collected from securing more than 20M Internet
			properties and blocking an average of 72B cyber threats per day.
		</li>
		<li class="bwlistitemmargb">
			<b>Seamless to implement and manage: </b>Cloudflare for Teams is
			expected to take less than an hour to deploy and saves hours of
			end-user time compared to traditional VPN solutions. IT teams can also
			manage comprehensive network security within the same dashboard or
			through Cloudflare’s partners, including Splunk, Datadog, and Sumo
			Logic.
		</li>
		<li class="bwlistitemmargb">
			<b>Massive scalability: </b>With 30 Tbps of network capacity,
			Cloudflare’s network can scale to meet the needs of the most demanding
			enterprises.
		</li>
		<li class="bwlistitemmargb">
			<b>Built-in DDoS mitigation: </b>Hackers are increasingly targeting
			office infrastructure for denial of service attacks. Cloudflare for
			Teams is built with the same industry-leading DDoS mitigation benefits
			as Cloudflare for Infrastructure.
		</li>
		<li class="bwlistitemmargb">
			<b>Near users, wherever they are—literally:</b> Instead of backhauling
			traffic, users connect to Cloudflare’s network in 200 cities around
			the world, within 100 milliseconds of 99% of the developed world’s
			Internet-connected population.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>Cloudflare for Teams Customers</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		"Cloudflare Access has enabled Ziff Media Group to seamlessly and
		securely deliver our suite of internal tools to employees around the
		world on any device, without the need for complicated network
		configurations,” said Josh Butts, SVP Product &amp; Technology, Ziff Media
		Group.
	</p>
	<p>
		“VPNs are frustrating and lead to countless wasted cycles for employees
		and the IT staff supporting them,” said Amod Malviya, Cofounder and CTO,
		Udaan. “Furthermore, conventional VPNs can lull people into a false
		sense of security. With Cloudflare Access, we have a far more reliable,
		intuitive, secure solution that operates on a per user, per access
		basis. I think of it as Authentication 2.0 — even 3.0”
	</p>
	<p>
		“Roman makes healthcare accessible and convenient,” said Ricky
		Lindenhovius, Engineering Director, Roman Health. “Part of that mission
		includes connecting patients to physicians, and Cloudflare helps Roman
		securely and conveniently connect doctors to internally managed tools.
		With Cloudflare, Roman can evaluate every request made to internal
		applications for permission and identity, while also improving speed and
		user experience.”
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Cloudflare for Teams Partners</b>

		the value of the cloud during every phase of our customers’ digital
		transformation,” said Lisa McLin, vice president of alliances and
		channel chief at Rackspace. “Our partnership with Cloudflare enables us
		to deliver cutting edge networking performance to our customers and
		helps them leverage a software defined networking architecture in their
		journey to the cloud.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“Employees are increasingly working outside of the traditional corporate
		headquarters. Distributed and remote users need to connect to the
		Internet, but today’s security solutions often require they backhaul
		those connections through headquarters to have the same level of
		security,” said Michael Kenney, head of strategy and business
		development for Ingram Micro Cloud. “We’re excited to work with
		Cloudflare whose global network helps teams of any size reach internally
		managed applications and securely use the Internet, protecting the data,
		devices, and team members that power a business.”
	</p>
	<p>
		"At Okta, we’re on a mission to enable any organization to securely use
		any technology. As a leading provider of identity for the enterprise,
		Okta helps organizations remove the friction of managing their corporate
		identity for every connection and request that their users make to
		applications. We’re excited about our partnership with Cloudflare and
		bringing seamless authentication and connection to teams of any size,”
		said Chuck Fontana, VP, Corporate &amp; Business Development, Okta.

		endpoints,” said Matt Hastings, Senior Director of Product Management at
		Tanium. “We are excited to partner with Cloudflare to help teams secure
		their data, off-network devices, and applications. Tanium’s platform
		provides customers with a risk-based approach to operations and security
		with instant visibility and control into their endpoints. Cloudflare
		helps extend that protection by incorporating device data to enforce
		security for every connection made to protected resources.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“OneLogin is happy to partner with Cloudflare to advance security teams'
		identity control in any environment, whether on-premise or in the cloud,
		without compromising user performance," said Gary Gwin, Senior Director
		of Product at OneLogin. "OneLogin’s identity and access management
		platform securely connects people and technology for every user, every
		app, and every device. The OneLogin and Cloudflare for Teams integration
		provides a comprehensive identity and network control solution for teams

		from outside of the office, it is vital that they understand each
		request users are making. They need real-time insights and intelligence
		to react to incidents and audit secure connections," said John Coyle, VP
		of Business Development, Sumo Logic. "With our partnership with
		Cloudflare, customers can now log every request made to internal
		applications and automatically push them directly to Sumo Logic for
		retention and analysis."
	</p>
	<p>
		“Cloudgenix is excited to partner with Cloudflare to provide an
		end-to-end security solution from the branch to the cloud. As
		enterprises move off of expensive legacy MPLS networks and adopt branch
		to internet breakout policies, the CloudGenix CloudBlade platform and
		Cloudflare for Teams together can make this transition seamless and
		secure. We’re looking forward to Cloudflare’s roadmap with this
		announcement and partnership opportunities in the near term.” said Aaron
		Edwards, Field CTO, Cloudgenix.
	</p>
	<p>
