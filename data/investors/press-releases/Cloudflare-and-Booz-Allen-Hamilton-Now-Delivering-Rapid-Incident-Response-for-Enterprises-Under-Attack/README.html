		Malicious attacks like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and ransomware can overwhelm Internet properties or corporate networks with traffic, causing disruptions in operations. In recent months, the world has faced some of the largest cyber attacks to-date. Last year, Cloudflare mitigated a record-breaking 71 million request-per-second DDoS attack—the <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.cloudflare.com%2Fcloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack%2F&amp;esheet=53924146&amp;newsitemid=20240408290551&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=largest+reported+HTTP+DDoS+attack+on+record&amp;index=3&amp;md5=5354d0e25cb5032ecfa986a0cdae1fc3" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">largest reported HTTP DDoS attack on record</a> at the time, and helped discover an online threat, dubbed <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2Fpress-releases%2F2023%2Fcloudflare-helps-discover-new-online-threat-that-led-to-largest-attack-in%2F&amp;esheet=53924146&amp;newsitemid=20240408290551&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=%26%238220%3BHTTP%2F2+Rapid+Reset%2C%26%238221%3B+that+led+to+the+largest+attack&amp;index=4&amp;md5=c4574f7b67b37988266a541844e575b9" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">“HTTP/2 Rapid Reset,” that led to the largest attack</a> in Internet history. To help mitigate the impact of this threat for the entire Internet ecosystem, Cloudflare quickly developed technology purpose-built to automatically block any attack leveraging Rapid Reset for its customers.

		“Cloudflare is known for being able to stop the largest cyber attacks in the world. We stand ready, now working with Booz Allen, to onboard and work hand-in-hand with organizations for immediate protection during the most pressing times,” said Mark Anderson, President of Revenue, Cloudflare. “Across the commercial sector, we are seeing attacks increase as threat vectors expand.

Working together, Cloudflare and Booz Allen will be able to guide organizations under attack to mitigation with protection and expertise when they are needed most."
