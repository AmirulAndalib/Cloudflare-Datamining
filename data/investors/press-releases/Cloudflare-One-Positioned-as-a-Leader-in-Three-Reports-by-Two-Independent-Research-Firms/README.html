		The old model of the corporate network has been made obsolete by mobile, SaaS, and the public cloud, further exacerbated by the explosion of digital transformation and the mass adoption of a hybrid work model. This rapid technology evolution, paired with the fact that threats such as phishing have become multichannel, has exposed the necessity for the adoption of a new more effective model that consolidates security natively in the cloud.

	</p>
	<p>
		“We are proud to be recognized as one of the only vendors that provides a comprehensive and deeply-integrated Zero Trust security and networking solution available today,” said Matthew Prince, CEO and co-founder of Cloudflare. “And, while definitions may vary from vendor to vendor, you can’t have a complete Zero Trust platform without a native email solution. To us, Zero Trust includes an integrated approach to securing all of an organization’s applications, including its most ubiquitous cloud application, email. We believe that being recognized as a leader across all three reports is just one more indication that we’re giving customers the most complete Zero Trust platform available.”

	<p>
		<b>The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Email Security</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Email Security, Q2 2023 report named Cloudflare a Leader based on a detailed evaluation of 15 top providers. This is Cloudflare’s first appearance in the report following the acquisition of Area 1 Security, with the company receiving the highest score possible in nine criteria including vision, innovation, antimalware and sandboxing, email filtering and malicious email detection. According to Forrester, “Cloudflare’s Zero Trust approach to email security is a fit for organizations that need easily communicated data and insights in addition to in-depth content analysis and processing.”

	<p>
		<b>IDC MarketScape for Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)</b>
