Cloudflare One for AI, a suite of Zero Trust security controls, will enable enterprises to safely and securely use the latest generative AI tools without putting intellectual property and customer data at risk.

	<p>
		With every transformative step forward in technology, from mobile phones to cloud computing, there are new security threats that rise to the surface. Major companies have banned the use of popular generative AI chat apps because of sensitive data leaks, and Italy instituted a temporary ban on generative AI tools for inadequate user data protections. According to a <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finfo.kpmg.us%2Fnews-perspectives%2Ftechnology-innovation%2Fkpmg-generative-ai-2023.html&amp;esheet=53399871&amp;newsitemid=20230515005207&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=KPMG+survey&amp;index=3&amp;md5=25b680fba39475ee46903ac253fe52b8" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">KPMG survey</a> on generative AI, AI is expected to have an enormous impact on business, but the majority of US executives surveyed are years away from implementing it; cyber security (81%) and data privacy (78%) are the most top of mind concerns for leaders. CISOs and CIOs need to strike a balance between enabling transformative innovation through AI and still maintaining compliance with data privacy regulations. Whether it’s an employee experimenting with AI, or a company initiative, once proprietary data is exposed to AI, there is no way to reverse it.

	</p>
	<p>
		"AI holds incredible promise, but without proper guardrails it can create significant risks for businesses. It is far too easy, by default, to upload sensitive internal or customer data to AI tools. Once the data is used for training AI, it is virtually impossible to get it out," explained Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. "If you were going to let a class of university students rummage around in your internal data, you'd of course put clear rules in place on what data they can access and how it can be used in their education. Cloudflare's Zero Trust products are the first to provide the guard rails for AI tools, so businesses can take advantage of the opportunity AI unlocks while ensuring only the data you want to expose gets shared."

	</p>
	<p>
		Cloudflare One for AI provides a simple, fast, and secure way for companies to safely build using the latest generative AI technologies, without compromising security or performance. With Cloudflare One, companies can gain visibility into and measure AI tool usage, prevent data loss, and manage integrations:
