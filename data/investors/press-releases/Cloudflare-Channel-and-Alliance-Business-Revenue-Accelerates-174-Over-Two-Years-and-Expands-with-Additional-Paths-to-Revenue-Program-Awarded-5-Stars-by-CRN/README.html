		With the rapid growth of interconnected applications, employees, and devices, comes new and more sophisticated attack vectors. Organizations with limited security and traditional network architectures are not only facing increased risk of attack, but are also hindered by the lack of freedom to innovate between cloud applications. Cloudflare’s <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2Fconnectivity-cloud%2F&amp;esheet=53915260&amp;newsitemid=20240326328287&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=connectivity+cloud&amp;index=5&amp;md5=27ff9c1a20fc7c1b13ef48ab3b7be96c" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">connectivity cloud</a> is the digital core for businesses to transform how they connect, protect, and build in their digital environments.

	</p>
	<p>
		Partners are crucial to extend the solutions and support that customers need to control application complexity, reduce cyber risk, and cut costs, all through Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare’s all-in-one, robust approach to an organization’s cybersecurity framework includes connectivity between multiple clouds. Over the past year, Cloudflare has partnered with a large number of organizations, realizing the business opportunity of helping customers secure their Internet applications and innovate with full control across cloud environments.
