<h2 class="marketing-subtitle marketing-subtitle--margin-top">Acquisition will allow Cloudflare to extend its benefits to mobile users everywhere</h2>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA, November 14, 2017 -- <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cloudflare">Cloudflare</a>, the leading Internet performance and security company, today announced it has acquired <a href="https://neumob.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Neumob">Neumob</a>, a leader in speeding up mobile apps, reducing errors, and boosting conversions. The acquisition joins Neumob’s technology with Cloudflare’s expansive global network to extend many of the Cloudflare benefits to mobile applications on virtually any device.</p>

<p>Neumob, based in Sunnyvale, raised $10.9 million, most recently in a Series A funding round led by Accel Partners. Neumob's mobile software development kit (SDK) is aimed at app developers who can embed their software within a mobile application. Early in the company's history, Neumob also released VPN software that could be installed by end-users in their mobile phones.</p>

<p>The SDK speeds up load times and in-app performance by 30 to 300 percent and reduces app errors and timeouts by up to 90 percent. It also significantly reduces bandwidth usage and data fees. Companies like HotelTonight, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, and others included the Neumob code with their applications to increase performance and reduce errors. This technology helps app owners retain users and drive revenue growth by providing a vastly improved mobile experience.</p>

<p>To ensure that this technology was able to scale and reach users, Neumob needed a network. Cloudflare’s global network now spans 118 data centers in 58 countries, with more than 7 million domains. By joining Neumob’s technology with Cloudflare’s scale, the performance, security, and cost of moving data are improved at every stage across the network, from origin to desktop, and now to mobile. For the first time, this brings security and performance to all endpoints and ensures complete network connectivity.</p>

<p>Combined with Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/railgun/">Railgun</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-warp/">Warp</a>, and <a href="https://cloudflare.com/argo">Argo</a> products, the Neumob code means that data flowing to and from mobile applications will be optimized, secured, routed and accelerated across Cloudflare’s network end-to-end: from handset to origin server and back.</p>

<p>“Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet—we mean that literally,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. “With Neumob, we’re now able to reach the last-mile of connectivity and provide the fastest and most secure experience possible for users everywhere, on any device.”</p>

<p>Neumob has ceased service to its customers and the team will be joining Cloudflare.</p>

<p>“We’ve long needed a global network running at the edge to fully realize the technology we’ve created at Neumob,” said Jeff Kim, co-founder of Neumob. “Now that we’re a part of the Cloudflare team, we have a tremendous opportunity to engage with Cloudflare’s customers and improve the mobile experience for users around the world.”</p>
