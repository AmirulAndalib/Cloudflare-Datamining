		<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2F&amp;esheet=53569031&amp;newsitemid=20231003138806&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Cloudflare%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=757fb0755753fc10c3ffef18a591762e" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Cloudflare, Inc.</a> (NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, today announced that all connectivity elements of Cloudflare’s single-vendor SASE platform, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2Fcloudflare-one%2F&amp;esheet=53569031&amp;newsitemid=20231003138806&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Cloudflare+One&amp;index=2&amp;md5=dd14967cdbcf49ca1822e8b7622fc405" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Cloudflare One</a>, are now generally available. Cloudflare’s SASE offering addresses both security and networking transformation requirements without adding complexity, a crucial differentiator in protecting today’s hybrid workforce.

	</p>
	<p>
		As organizations migrate to the cloud to accelerate innovation and maintain a competitive edge, they often grapple with network complexity, along with the need to connect and secure distributed employees, devices, apps, and data centers — all without sacrificing performance. Without a flexible IT infrastructure, organizations face issues such as security gaps from distributed users and personal devices, which introduces significant risk to corporate data and increases overall cost. To combat this, organizations are drastically shifting to adopt single-vendor SASE platforms. According to Gartner®, "by 2026, 60% of new SD-WAN purchases will be part of a single-vendor SASE offering, up from 15% in 2023." Cloudflare One allows customers to adopt SASE as it fits their existing deployments including native single-vendor deployments with Cloudflare, or by leveraging existing SD-WAN deployments. Cloudflare’s branch appliance, Magic WAN Connector, can be pre-installed on hardware delivered by <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tdsynnex.com%2Fna%2Fus%2F&amp;esheet=53569031&amp;newsitemid=20231003138806&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=TD+SYNNEX&amp;index=3&amp;md5=8150d767f664c138ca58c32f919b1d71" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">TD SYNNEX</a>, a leading global distributor and solutions aggregator for the IT ecosystem, or installed within organizations’ existing environments.

		Every day, enterprise technology leaders bring together thousands of people, devices, clouds, systems, applications, and networks to support a new business imperative: the digital imperative, to work, develop, and deliver everything everywhere.
