		<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2F&amp;esheet=52922500&amp;newsitemid=20220921005958&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Cloudflare%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=054c90f40ba2ec026f10c3e5b0375a27" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Cloudflare, Inc.</a> (NYSE: NET), the security, performance, and reliability company helping to build a better Internet, today announced that Cloudflare’s <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2Fdata-localization%2F&amp;esheet=52922500&amp;newsitemid=20220921005958&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Data+Localization+Suite&amp;index=2&amp;md5=653fe183340b973e0a4a5af6eeaccf48" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Data Localization Suite</a> (DLS) is now available in three new countries in the Asia Pacific region: Australia, India, and Japan. The Data Localization Suite will help businesses based in these countries, as well as global companies who do business in these countries, to comply with their data localization obligations by using Cloudflare to easily set rules and controls on where their domestic data goes and who has access to it. This ultimately allows any business with customers in these countries to service their data locally while benefiting from the speed, security, and scalability of Cloudflare’s global network.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Functad.org%2Fpage%2Fdata-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide&amp;esheet=52922500&amp;newsitemid=20220921005958&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Nearly+70%25&amp;index=3&amp;md5=6ae4c95a37e64332af69f8082ef2e25c" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Nearly 70%</a> of countries in Asia have passed or drafted new data protection and privacy legislation. This often makes it difficult for regional companies to use foreign-based vendors to handle domestic traffic. Without regional support, many businesses are under pressure to use only in-country run vendors and may be required to restrict their application to one data center or one cloud provider’s region. This creates a trade-off between compliance and fast, secure experiences for end users. With the Data Localization Suite, businesses of any size or industry can now use Cloudflare to get more choice and control over how to meet their data locality needs, without sacrificing security or performance.
	</p>
	<p>
		“No business should have to choose between compliance with local data regulation and a superior experience for their customers. And yet, we hear time and again that companies are forced to do so in the face of a complex and ever-changing landscape of regional legislation,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO, Cloudflare. "By expanding our Data Localization Suite to our customers in Australia, India, and Japan, we're ensuring data locality doesn't have to come at the expense of the speed, security, and privacy users expect and deserve online."
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, businesses in Australia, India, and Japan can use Cloudflare’s Data Localization Suite to:
	</p>
	<ul class="bwlistdisc">
		<li>
			<b>Control where traffic is serviced</b>: Companies can choose the data center locations where their traffic is inspected. Businesses can also use Cloudflare’s Geo Key Manager to choose where private keys are held.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Build and deploy serverless code, with regional control</b>: Build applications that allow developers to combine global performance with local compliance regulations. Jurisdiction Restrictions for Workers Durable Objects makes it easy to build serverless applications that are confined to a specific region.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Use Cloudflare’s security features to protect their web properties:</b> Customers can use WAF, Bot Management, DDoS protection and more to ensure their websites are safe and stay online.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Align with global and regional security certifications: </b>Businesses can trust that they are compliant with global privacy and security certifications like ISO 27001, 27701, and 27018 while still offering performance and speed at scale.
		</li>
	</ul>

Preserving end-user privacy is core to Cloudflare’s mission of helping to build a better Internet, and we look forward to working with businesses across Australia, India, and Japan to enable them to provide fast, private, reliable, and secure services to their end-users,” said Jonathon Dixon, VP and Managing Director, Asia Pacific, Japan, and China, Cloudflare.

		Data Localization Suite has supported Cloudflare customers in alignment with European localization requirements and regulations since 2020.
	</p>
	<p>
		“We're thrilled to extend Cloudflare's localization benefits to our customers providing them greater control as they manage international data transfer requirements,” said Blake Brannon, Chief Strategy Officer, OneTrust. “Our partnership with Cloudflare supports our mission to empower our customers to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape with ease.”
