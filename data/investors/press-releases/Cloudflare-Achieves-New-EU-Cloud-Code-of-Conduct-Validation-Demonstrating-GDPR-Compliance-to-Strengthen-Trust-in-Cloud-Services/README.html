	<center>New global data protection and GDPR compliance validation reinforces Cloudflare’s
		commitment to cloud security and data protection and privacy in Europe</center>
</p>

<p><strong>San Francisco, CA, and Brussels, Belgium, [March 30, 2023]</strong> — <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare, Inc.</a> (NYSE: NET), the security,
	performance, and reliability company helping to build a better Internet, today announced it has
	successfully demonstrated compliance with the EU Cloud Code of Conduct, a code officially approved
	under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), providing tailored guidance for GDPR
	implementation. The EU Cloud Code of Conduct covers all cloud service layers, and compliance is
	validated by accredited monitoring body SCOPE Europe. Cloudflare’s global network and strong
	commitment to upholding the very highest data protection standards will encourage the adoption of
	privacy-protecting cloud services across the continent by reinforcing for end users the importance of
	data protection.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://eucoc.cloud/en/home">EU Cloud Code of Conduct</a> brings trust and transparency to the European cloud computing market,
	helping organizations to source cloud services from GDPR-compliant providers hence boosting adoption
	of this key innovation-friendly initiative across the EU and beyond. Commenting on the milestone
	Cloudflare’s Chief Privacy Officer, Emily Hancock, said “The question of how personal data is handled by
	cloud services and how these services comply with the GDPR remains a key concern that we hear every
	day when we talk with CIOs and Data Protection Officers, whether in the private or public sector. This is
	why Cloudflare joined the EU Cloud Code of Conduct last May, and alongside our existing privacy
	certifications ISO 27701 and ISO 27018, demonstrates our commitment to the highest standards of data
	protection globally. Today we are proud to successfully complete our assessment journey by receiving
	the EU Cloud Code of Conduct compliance mark as it demonstrates our compliance with the GDPR and is
	an important milestone in our mission to help to build a better Internet.”</p>

<p>Cloudflare has been audited by a 3rd-party privacy specialist as meeting this important standard. The
	independent auditor validated over 80 controls and their public validation report will be available shortly
	from the Cloudflare Trust Hub for customers, partners, and other stakeholders to download and review.
	The report details 47 Cloudflare products across Application and Network services, Cloudflare’s
	developer platform Workers, Cloudflare One Zero Trust Services, Analytics, and the Cloudflare privacy
	and compliance portfolio including the Data Localization Suite (DLS).</p>

<p><strong>About the EU Cloud Code of Conduct</strong></p>

<p>Following a positive opinion by the European Data Protection Board, the EU Cloud Code of Conduct was
	fully approved by the Belgian Data Protection Authority and is therefore a legally-operational Code of
	Conduct pursuant to Article 40 of the GDPR. Defining clear requirements for Cloud Service Providers to
	implement Article 28 GDPR, the Code covers all cloud service layers (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), has its compliance
	overseen by an accredited monitoring body, and represents the vast majority of the European cloud
	industry market share.</p>
