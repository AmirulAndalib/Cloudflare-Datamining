		<i>Acquisition brings patented technology to Cloudflare for Teams</i>
	</p>
	<p> SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
		<a rel="nofollow" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2F&amp;esheet=52154293&amp;newsitemid=20200107005314&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Cloudflare%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=7bc27b3cef246dea220906eafd4553a8">Cloudflare,
			Inc.</a>, (NYSE: NET), the security, performance, and reliability
		company helping to build a better Internet, today announced that it has
		acquired S2 Systems Corporation (S2), a company that has developed
		patented browser isolation technology to make everyday web browsing
		safer and faster. Following this acquisition, Cloudflare expects to add
		S2’s technology to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.cloudflare.com%2Fgateway%2F&amp;esheet=52154293&amp;newsitemid=20200107005314&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Cloudflare+Gateway&amp;index=2&amp;md5=47a76ecb1c2f4e4d09ff8c6833dfab0f">Cloudflare

			for Teams</a>, a new security suite that is designed to protect
		corporate employees and data without sacrificing performance.
	</p>
	<p>
		S2, based in Kirkland, Washington, has developed browser isolation
		technology that executes browser code on cloud servers rather than on a
		user’s device. The solution keeps security threats away from the device,
		only sending rendering instructions to the viewer’s browser. Users
		navigate the Internet without adding risk posed by threats across the
		public Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Existing solutions typically rely on streaming video of web content
		(pixel streaming) or attempting to sanitize known malicious content (DOM
		reconstruction) that forces users to make a tradeoff between security
		and performance. S2’s approach is designed to avoid this tradeoff.
		Cloudflare expects that S2’s technology will be able to protect
		endpoints from zero-day vulnerabilities without sacrificing speed,
		website compatibility, or user experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		“The experienced team at S2 Systems has built an advanced technology
		that we believe surpasses other browser isolation technologies,” said
		Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. “When we met their
		team and evaluated the technology they’ve built, we knew that they had
		the missing piece we needed to support our Gateway product and build out
		our new Cloudflare for Teams capabilities. We can’t wait to integrate
		their stellar team within Cloudflare and utilize their remarkable
		technology in our platform as we continue to help build a better
		Internet.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“Cloudflare’s team is nimble and mission-led, and we felt there were
		great synergies across our teams and alignment across our ambitions and
		goals. Their ability to run code at the edge—the way it should be run—is
		unlike anything we’ve seen before, and we’re excited to join our
		technology with their existing platform,” said Darren Remington,
		co-founder of S2 Systems. “In joining Cloudflare’s team,” said David
		Harnett, co-founder and CEO of S2 Systems, “we truly feel that we can
		make a difference across the whole Internet, by making it faster,
		better, and safer for all users.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Customers and industry peers agree:
	</p>
	<p>
		Amit Mital, former CTO of Symantec and current CEO of Kernel Labs said,
		“S2’s technology is an innovative approach that changes the fundamental
		calculus for remote browser isolation. When combined with the global
		Cloudflare network and edge compute capabilities of Cloudflare Workers,
		it represents a revolution of the browser and how we securely interact
		with the web.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“We have been testing S2’s cloud browser and are blown away by the
		capabilities of this system. We’ve evaluated other remote browser
		isolation solutions and the S2 Systems approach is an exciting
		breakthrough in this space,” said John Carreno, VP IT Infrastructure and
		Operations at ARS.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Our company is a national consulting firm serving enterprise clients
		who need a web browsing solution that provides security without
		compromising user experience or website compatibility,” said Ryan
		Janzen, Managing Partner at Teleion Consulting. “The S2 cloud browser
		checks every box. It is not only transparent, but faster than regular
		browsing.”
	</p>
	<p>
		S2’s founding team members are former senior Microsoft employees and
		have strong backgrounds in Enterprise technology. As a result of the
		acquisition, the S2 team has joined Cloudflare and is located at
		Cloudflare’s new office in the Seattle metropolitan area.
