Cloudflare began publicly reporting information about its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts in 2021. This year, the company focused on expanding the value and scope of Cloudflare’s Impact programs; supporting humanitarian and human rights causes, most notably helping protect Ukrainians’ access to the Internet by protecting against DDoS and other cyber attacks; and examining how the company calculates and validates emissions data.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Cloudflare has built a team of employees dedicated to providing real, positive impact for the millions of users of our services and the billions of Internet users our decisions affect,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. “In 2022, the company has jumped into action to help protect people in Ukraine, secure a fair and trusted midterm election so that cyber security was not a headline, and contribute to the development of privacy-enhancing protocols that will ripple far beyond our customers. Whatever next year brings, we’ll be ready to continue ensuring the Internet is accessible, safe, and reliable for all.”

			<b>Engineering privacy into the Internet: </b>This year, Cloudflare pioneered implementation of numerous technologies designed to ensure Internet service providers (ISPs) and other network observers cannot track websites their subscribers visit. <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.cloudflare.com%2Fbuilding-privacy-into-internet-standards-and-how-to-make-your-app-more-private-today%2F&amp;esheet=53080615&amp;newsitemid=20221216005473&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Privacy+Gateway&amp;index=10&amp;md5=d175be799b0359e46e14be2394925c6b" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Privacy Gateway</a> builds on those efforts by relaying encrypted data packets through our servers to obscure user IP addresses. In 2022, we partnered with a period tracker app to enable Privacy Gateway to prevent the ISP and app from being able to associate individual IP addresses with the tracker.

			<b>Protecting 2,150 vulnerable organizations from an average of 57.9 million cyber threats per day:</b> Founded in 2014, Cloudflare’s <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2Fgalileo%2F&amp;esheet=53080615&amp;newsitemid=20221216005473&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Project+Galileo&amp;index=11&amp;md5=cb139755c9f4ebcd6fef79b5b2d8e72d" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Project Galileo</a> provides free cyber security protection to qualified public interest groups like artists, advocates, humanitarian organizations, and the voices of political dissent that face cyber threats in disproportionate numbers.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Securing small businesses: </b>Small businesses don’t always have the budget for security services; as of December 2022, we identified millions of free accounts responsible for roughly 70 trillion requests over the Cloudflare network in 2022. This is a value of $7 million of content delivery network services that they received at no cost.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Cloudflare services yield significant emissions savings: </b>Preliminary findings from an upcoming study by Analysys Mason estimate that Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall (WAF) “generates up to around 90% less carbon than on-premises appliances at low-medium traffic demand.”
