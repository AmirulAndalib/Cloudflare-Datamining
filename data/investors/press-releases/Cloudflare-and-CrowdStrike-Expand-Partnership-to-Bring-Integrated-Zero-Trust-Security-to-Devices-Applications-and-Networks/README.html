		“Every business needs to protect users and teams no matter where they are or how they’re working," said John Graham-Cumming, chief technology officer at Cloudflare.

As employees continue to work from anywhere and businesses continue to navigate the transition to a hybrid approach to work, security teams are moving away from legacy security architecture towards a modern Zero Trust approach.
