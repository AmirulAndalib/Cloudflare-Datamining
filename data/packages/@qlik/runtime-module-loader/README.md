# @qlik/runtime-module-loader

Library used for loading Qlik's public runtime modules

This package is used by `@qlik/embed-` libraries to load runtime modules from Qlik's embedded solution and should typically not be used outside of that scope.

Documentation about Qlik Embed can be found here <https://qlik.dev/embed/qlik-embed/qlik-embed-introduction>
