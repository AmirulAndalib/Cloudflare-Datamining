### Patch Changes

- 45140b3e68: Create Code Block component, for syntax highlighting code in React apps:

  ```ts
  import CodeBlock, { TabbedCodeBlock } from '@cloudflare/component-code-block';
  ```

  The `CodeBlock` component is what you'll use if you need a single highlighted code block:

  ```tsx
  <CodeBlock language="js" code="console.log('hi')" />
  ```

  `TabbedCodeBlock` is what you'll use if you need to support multiple languages (or options) for a single code block, which will render with tabs for each option:

  ```tsx
  <TabbedCodeBlock
    options={{
      npm: {
        language: 'sh',
        code: 'npm i left-pad'
      },
      yarn: {
        language: 'sh',
        code: 'yarn add left-pad'
      }
    }}
  />
  ```
