These checks frequently caused more problems than they solved.\n- Fixed an issue where the UI would always launch on startup\n- Fixed issue where Zero Trust users would receive a notification to update the client even though upgrades were disabled in settings\n- Fixed issue where the GUI would show disconnected when it should show Paused\n- Fixed various issues with warp-diag and improve overall stability\n \n \n**Known issues** \n- UI incorrectly Shows Virtual Networks selector when there is only 1 default network. This UI should be hidden unless there are actually multiple networks to choose from.\n \n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/",
