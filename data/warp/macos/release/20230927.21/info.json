Examples of this UI and the types of errors your users will see can be found in the [client errors documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/troubleshooting/client-errors/)\n- Added new posture type: [Client certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/client-certificate/)\n- Added support for IPv6 DEX Traceroute tests (previously only IPv4 addresses could be used)\n- Improved reliability and efficiency in configurating split tunnel rules. Most `error petting the dog` errors should now be gone and organizations with large split tunnel configuration should see reliability improvements.\n- Modify IPv6 DNS behavior to no longer bind to discrete stub resolvers and instead point interfaces at a V6->V4 mapping `::ffff:127.0.2.2`. This change makes DNS mapping consistent on all platforms\n- Fixed an issue where warp-svc.exe could crash under extreme load\n- Fixed an issue with DEX traceroutes tests where not all hops were correctly reported\n- Fixed an issue where DEX tests would not properly run immediately after a device came out of sleep\n- Fixed an issue where DEX tests would execute simultaneously causing performance issues for accounts with a large number of tests configured\n- Fixed an issue with DEX traceroutes tests where not all hops were correctly reported\n- Fixed an issue where DNS status would flap between Connected / Disconnect in Connectivity panel\n- Fixed an issue where DoH requests could take too long to timeout causes DNS reliability issues\n- Fixed an issue where DNS could temporarily fail when DHCP updates were processed\n- Fixed an issue on initial device registration that could sometimes cause it to fail and try again\n- Fixed an issue where UI could appear in the wrong location when the app starts\n- Fixed an issue where short DNS timeou",
