	"release_notes": "This release contains new features and improvements from last GA release.\n \n## Notable updates \n- Added support for Zero Trust Digital Experience Monitoring. More information coming soon for customers who signed up for the beta\n- Added new log message to help customers and support identify when a users local network IP space overlaps with a remote network configured to go through the tunnel\n- Added support for Zero Trust customers to opt in to having the WARP Client install the root CA for your organization if TLS Decryption is enabled. A new toggle switch will appear in the dashboard under Settings->WARP Client soon to enable this\n- Modified behavior of Managed networks tests to always happen outside the tunnel as per original intent\n- Modified firewall behavior to allow incoming UDP traffic on ports 67-68 over split tunnel routes configured to be protected by Gateway. This change should allow organizations with overlapping networks to an end users local network, to not leave their users in a completely broken state without internet connectivity\n- Improved user validation logic during manual ZT login\n- Improve timeouts with broken CNAME records that could result in very long load times for certain apps (Office 365 apps, etc.)\n- Fixed issue where trying to launch a support_url without a valid protocol handler (ex. https://) would result in an error\n- Fixed issue where systems with significantly out of sync system clocks could fail registration\n- Fixed panic that could result in loss of internet connectivity\n- Fixed issue where the WARP daemon can crash and lose connectivity\n- Fixed issue where warp-diag could run traceroutes longer than expected. Traceroute tests will now timeout after 65 seconds.\n- Fixed issue where manually logging into a ZT org could fail if certificate authentication was used\n- Fixed issue where GUI could miss a status message from the WARP Service resulting in the wrong state being reflected to users. An example is the GUI could show `Connecting` even though device was `Connected`\n- Fixed issue when running in local proxy mode where too many log entries were written\n \n## Known issues\nNo known issues\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
