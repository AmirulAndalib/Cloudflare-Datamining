The workaround is to use the `warp-cli registration delete` command to clear the registration, and then re-register the client.\n- There are certain known limitations preventing the use of the MASQUE tunnel protocol in certain scenarios. Do not use the MASQUE tunnel protocol if:\n  - A Magic WAN integration is on the account and is not yet migrated to the warp_unified_flow. Please check migration status with your account team.\n  - Your account has Regional Services enabled.\n   \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp  \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
