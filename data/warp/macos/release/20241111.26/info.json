With macOS 15.1, Apple addressed several issues that may have caused the WARP client to not behave as expected when used with macOS 15.0.x.\n\n## Changes and improvements\n- Fixed an issue where SSH sessions and other application connections over TCP or UDP could be dropped when using MASQUE and the device's primary network interface changed.\n- Fixed an issue to ensure the managed certificate is installed in the trust store if not already there.\n- Improved handling of multiple network interfaces on the system.\n- Improved reliability of connection establishment logic under degraded network conditions.\n- Improved captive portal detection behavior by forcing captive portal checks outside the tunnel.\n- Allow the ability to configure tunnel protocol for consumer registrations.\n- Fixed an issue with the WARP client becoming unresponsive during startup.\n- Extended diagnostics collection time in warp-diag to ensure logs are captured reliably.\n- Extended warp-diag to collect system profiler firewall state as part of diagnostics.\n- Fixed an issue with the WARP client becoming unresponsive while handling LAN inclusion.\n- Fixed an issue where users were unable to connect with an IPC error message displayed in the UI.\n- Fixed an issue that was preventing proper operation of DNS-over-TLS (DoT) for consumer users.\n\n## Known issues\n- macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare  recommends the use of macOS 15.1 or later.\n\nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
