	"release_notes": "This release contains significant improvements to our DNS functionality. In addition to overall improved DNS stability and performance, we now fully support DNS requests over TCP. This also modifies our local DNS proxy to use the internal IPs of 127.0.2.2, 127.0.2.3, fd01:db8:1111::2, and fd01:db8:1111::3. \n \n## Notable updates\n \n- Added support for DNS over TCP\n- Modified client font to be system default\n- Modified client behavior to no longer show massive upgrade notification when a new build is released, instead you'll now see a change to our system tray icon to indicate a new build is available\n- Fixed issue where the Virtual Network selector would appear for users with only a single network\n- Fixed issue where the Virtual Network selector may not appear after a reboot\n- Fixed issue where the Logout from Zero trust button would remain locked after an mdm.xml file was removed\n- Fixed issue where settings and/or UI may not properly clear when moving from one Zero Trust org to another\n- Fixed issue when coming out of sleep where it could take 60 seconds to connect while we waited for Apples connectivity checks to finish (and we didn't really need to) - Fixed WARP IPC error that could be caused when we fail to set particular firewall settings\n- Fixed issue multiple registration issues that could happen when re-applying local policy file (.plist)\n- Fixed incorrect \"OS not supported\" error in warp-cli when using teams-enroll\n- Fixed issue where updated posture checks might not take effect until restart\n- Fixed issue with warp-cli where enable/disable with wifi was allowed in Zero Trust mode\n- Fixed issue where too many DNS requests could result in the following error appearing in logs: WARN warp::dns: Shedding DNS load\n\n**Known issues** \n- Memory leak in the CloudflareWARP daemon process that can slowly grow over time.\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/",
