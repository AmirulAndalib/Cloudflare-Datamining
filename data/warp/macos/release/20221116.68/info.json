Paused when really disabled via Admin Override, etc.)\n- Fixed HappyEyeball issue where Safari users without native IPv6 may see increased captcha challenges\n- Fixed issue where device posture timers were paused while device was asleep. Posture tests are now immediately ran on device wakeup and all timers restarted\n- Fixed issue where GUI may still think user is registered after \"warp-cli delete\" is run\n- Decreased warp-diag zip file sizes by 60-80%\n \n \n## Known issues\n- If you are having issues with upgrading to new beta, please uninstall current app, install the GA version from https://1.1.1.1/ and participate in beta program from Preferences->Advanced.\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/",
