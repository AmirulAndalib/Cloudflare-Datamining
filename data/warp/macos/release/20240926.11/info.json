If you have any workflows that use the deprecated commands, please update to the new commands where necessary.\n\n## Known issues\n- Cloudflare is investigating temporary networking issues on macOS 15 (Sequoia) that seem to affect some users.\n- Using MASQUE as the tunnel protocol may be incompatible if your organization has Regional Services enabled.\n\nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp  \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
