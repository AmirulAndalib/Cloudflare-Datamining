All DNS functionality from the WARP client is disabled while in this service mode\n- Added support for ProductVersionExtra to be used in OS Version device posture checks\n- Improved performance of domain-based split tunneling when an IP address is already split tunneled (seen frequently with Zoom domains and IPs being used)\n- Improved performance of the client when in the \"Proxy Only\" service mode\n- Modified `warp-cli settings` to show if the applied settings came from local (mdm) or network (warp settings profile) policy to make debugging profile issues easier\n- Fixed an issue that could result in increased latency when resolving queries\n- Fixed an issue where inputting a license key of excessive length in the consumer login could result in high CPU usage\n- Optimized the performance of DNS queries to prevent minor memory leaks\n- Fixed an issue when service token information was removed from .plist the client would not prompt for user authentication as expected\n- Fixed 3rd party VPN Compatibility by adding a default /32 subnet to interfaces that don't have them by default (this was specifically to fix compat with NordLayer but may help others)\n- Fixed an issue where re-authentication button could show up in consumer 1.1.1.1 mode even though it is just a Zero Trust feature\n- Fixed an issue that could cause many requests for authentication to open in the browser\n- Fixed an issue that could cause registration errors when auth ID or other parameters are removed from a local MDM/.plist file\n- Fixed an issue where the client would attempt to connect even when the \"AUTO CONNECT\" setting was Disabled in WARP Settings or not specified either in an MDM file\n- Fixed an issue where the client could open multiple browser tabs to \"cloudflareportal.com/test\" during authentication scenarios\n- Fixed an issue where the GUI application would auto-populate upon return from a standby power state\n \n## Known issues\n- No known issues\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
