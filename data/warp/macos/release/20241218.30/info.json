With macOS 15.1, Apple addressed several issues that may have caused the WARP client to not behave as expected when used with macOS 15.0.x.\n\n## Changes and improvements\n- Consumers can now set the tunnel protocol using \"warp-cli tunnel protocol set <proto>\".\n- Extended diagnostics collection time in warp-diag to ensure logs are captured reliably.\n- Improved captive portal support by disabling the firewall during captive portal login flows.\n- Improved reliability of connection establishment logic under degraded network conditions.\n- Improved reconnection speed when a Cloudflare server is in a degraded state.\n- Improved captive portal detection on certain public networks.\n- Fixed an issue where admin override displayed an incorrect override end time.\n- Reduced connectivity interruptions on WireGuard include split tunnel configurations.\n- Fixed connectivity issues switching between managed network profiles with different configured protocols\n- QLOGs are now disabled by default and can be enabled with `warp-cli debug qlog enable`. The qlog setting from previous releases will no longer be respected.\n\n## Known issues\n- macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.2 or later.\n\nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
