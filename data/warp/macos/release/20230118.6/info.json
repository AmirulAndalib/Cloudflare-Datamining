	"release_notes": "This release has support for new Zero Trust network location aware feature and contains improvements to stability and bug fixes.\n \n## Hotfix Updates\n- Fixed issue where clients could lose IPv4 connectivity (2nd hotfix applied).\n- Fixed issue where clients would attempt to configure DNS even when in posture-only, or proxy modes.\n- Increased MDM file timeout to improve compatibility with certain management solutions.\n  \n## Notable updates in previous GA (2022.12.475.0)\n- Added support for new Zero Trust network location aware WARP feature. More info to be released soon on how you can test.\n- Improved captive portal handling for some more captive portals.\n- Improved reconnect logic when a setting changes to no longer always do a full disconnect->reconnect cycle (for instance when turning on DNS logging).\n- Modified initial connectivity check behavior to now validate both IPv4 and IPv6 are working (previously we only checked IPv4). Test will pass if either connects successfully.\n- Fixed issue where client could be stuck on `Connecting` if certain DNS checks failed once.\n- Fixed DNS issue where TXT records were not being correctly returned when at the end of a CNAME chain.\n- Fixed issue where the client may not receive notifications of new settings, re-auth events or posture from the service until reboot.\n- Fixed issue where users could be pointing at an old gateway_doh_subdomain if you have `Allowed to Leave` set to true and they've manually joined their client to your organization.\n- Fixed slow DNS timeout issue that could occur when IPv6 is enabled and an NXDOMAIN record is returned.\n- Fixed issue with `Gateway with DoH` mode could say `Connected` when it wasn't really connected as we could sometimes test the wrong endpoint.\n- Fixed issue where our local DNS proxy server could get unset with an overly active DHCP renew time or by plugging in/out a tethered device.\n- Fixed issue where `warp-cli teams-enroll` wouldn't work when an mdm file was present.\n- Fixed issue where our localhost dns endpoints (ex. 127.0.2.2) could appear in the fallback configuration potentially causing DNS lookups to fail\n- Fixed issues where GUI could crash when opening from the Menu Bar.\n- Fixed issue that could cause some DNS queries to take upto 15 seconds to complete.\n  \n## Known issues\n- If you are having issues with upgrading to new beta, please uninstall current app, install the GA version from https://1.1.1.1/ and participate in beta program from Preferences->Advanced.\n  \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n  \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
