Instead the client will now use the built in operating system notification framework to inform users of the need to authenticate.\n- Fixed issue where file device posture checks wouldn't work correctly when the file path was changed for an existing rule.\n \n## Known issues\n- No known issues\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
