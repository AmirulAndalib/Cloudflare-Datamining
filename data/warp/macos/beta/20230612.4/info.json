This new mode disabled all DNS functionality of the client while still retaining things such as the WARP Tunnel, DEX and posture support.\n \n## Notable updates\n- Add support for \"SWG without DNS Filtering\" mode\n- Add support for ProductVersionExtra to be used in OS Version posture checks\n- Improve performance of domain-based split tunneling when the IP was already split tunneled (seen frequently with Zoom domains and IPs being used)\n- Fixed issue that could cause many requests for authentication to open in the browser\n- Fixed issue where client could get into a bad state when auth id/secret removed from plist\n \n## Known issues\n- If you are having issues with upgrading to new beta, please uninstall current app, install the GA version from https://1.1.1.1/ and participate in beta program from Preferences -> Advanced.\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
