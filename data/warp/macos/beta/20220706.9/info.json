Anything after the `*` was included in the wildcard search so `*.example.com` would include  `badexample.com`\n- Fixed issue where client was sending improper ICMP responses when MTU needed to change\n- Fixed issue where logs could grow too large\n- Fixed issue where user could see an error dialog going between DNS modes\n- Fixed issue where user was reminded to update after just asking to be reminded later\n- Fixed crash in UI when viewing DNS logs and clicking on Resolver tab\n- Fixed issue where UI could sometimes appear not attached to menu bar\n \n## Known issues\n- No known issues\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
