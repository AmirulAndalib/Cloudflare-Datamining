	"release_notes": "This release primarily contains bug fixes, no new features are included in this release\n \n## Notable updates\n- Improved captive portal handling for some more captive portals.\n- Improved reconnect logic when a setting changes to no longer always do a full disconnect->reconnect cycle (for instance when turning on DNS logging).\n- Modified initial connectivity check behavior to now validate both IPv4 and IPv6 are working (previously we only checked IPv4). Test will pass if either connects successfully. \n- Fixed issue where client could be stuck on `Connecting` if certain DNS checks failed once.\n- Fixed DNS issue where TXT records were not being correctly returned when at the end of a CNAME chain.\n- Fixed issue where the client may not receive notifications of new settings, re-auth events or posture from the service until reboot.\n- Fixed issue where users could be pointing at an old gateway_doh_subdomain if you have `Allowed to Leave` set to true and they've manually joined their client to your organization.\n- Fixed slow DNS timeout issue that could occur when IPv6 is enabled and an NXDOMAIN record is returned.\n- Fixed issue with `Gateway with DoH` mode could say `Connected` when it wasn't really connected as we could sometimes test the wrong endpoint.\n- Fixed issue where our local DNS proxy server could get unset with an overly active DHCP renew time or by plugging in/out a tethered device.\n \n## Known issues\n- There is a race condition that may cause IPv4 traffic to fail after the tunnel starts up. This can be fixed by togglingÂ off then back on the connection. A hotfix is in the works.\n- If you are having issues with upgrading to new beta, please uninstall current app, install the GA version from https://1.1.1.1/ and participate in beta program from Preferences->Advanced.\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
