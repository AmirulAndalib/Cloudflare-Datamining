No new features are introduced with this release.\n \n## Notable updates\n- Improved performance of client when in Proxy Only mode\n- Modified `warp-cli settings` to now show if setting came from local (mdm) or network (warp settings profile) policy to make debugging issues easier\n- Fixed issue that could result in latency increases every few minutes\n- Fixed a consumer only issue where a license key of excessive length could result in 100% cpu usage\n- Fixed a minor memory leak every time we did a DNS query\n- Fixed issue when service token information was removed from .plist the client would not prompt for user authentication as expected\n- Fixed 3rd party VPN Compatibility by adding a default /32 subnet to interfaces that don't have them by default (this was specifically to fix compat with NordLayer but may help others)\n- Fixed issue where re-authentication button could show up in consumer 1.1.1.1 mode even though it is just a Zero Trust feature\n \n## Known issues\n- If you are having issues with upgrading to new beta, please uninstall current app, install the GA version from https://1.1.1.1/ and participate in beta program from Preferences->Advanced.\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
