This relates to TunnelVision (CVE-2024-3661).\n- Fixed an issue that could cause the Cloudflare WARP menu bar application to disappear when switching configurations.\n\n## Known issues\n- If a user has an MDM file configured to support multiple profiles (for the switch configurations feature), and then changes to an MDM file configured for a single profile, the WARP client may not connect. The workaround is to use the 'warp-cli registration delete' command to clear the registration, and then re-register the client.\n\nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp  \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
