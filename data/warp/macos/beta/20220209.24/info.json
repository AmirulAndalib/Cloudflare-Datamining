In particular this build now supports the ability to configure settings via the Dashboard and not just with a .plist. Note that settings in your .plist always overrule what comes from the dashboard.\n\n## Notable updates\n- The \"enabled\" .plist property has now been completely deprecated and is no longer read. Please see https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters#switch_locked for the mechanism announced in April 2021\n- Now that settings exist in the Zero Trust Dashboard the Client UI should behave the same regardless of if you manually joined to a Team or if you were forced to by local .plist policy\n- Updated Teams logo in app to Zero Trust\n- Fixed issue where the WARP Client might not get updated settings when it initial starts\n- Fixed issue where the Last Seen value was not updated properly in the Zero Trust Dashboard while in Gateway with DoH mode\n- Fixed issue where device name was not updated in the Zero trust Dashboard if the computer name changed after initial registration\n- Fixed issue where you could not log out a team after clicking \"Reset Encryption Keys\"\n- Fixed various issues with split tunnel support in consumer mode\n- Fixed issue where \"warp-cli settings\" showed connection time in settings instead of minutes\n\n\n## Known issues\nNo known issues",
