More info to be released soon on how you can test.\n- Fixed issue where `warp-cli teams-enroll` wouldn't work when an mdm file was present\n- Fixed issue where our localhost dns endpoints (ex. 127.0.2.2) could appear in the fallback configuration potentially causing DNS lookups to fail\n- Fixed issues where GUI could crash when opening from the Menu Bar\n- Fixed issue that could cause some DNS queries to take upto 15 seconds to complete\n \n \n## Known issues\n- There is a race condition that may cause IPv4 traffic to fail after the tunnel starts up. This can be fixed by togglingÂ off then back on the connection. A hotfix is in the works.\n- If you are having issues with upgrading to new beta, please uninstall current app, install the GA version from https://1.1.1.1/ and participate in beta program from Preferences->Advanced.\n \nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
