	"release_notes": "This release contains a security fix for IPv6 users introduced in a prior release, major bug fixes and a significant change to the Zero Trust authentication flow.\n\n**NOTE** This release contains a bug that impacts Zero Trust users who deploy with .msi command line parameters that will break clean installs. For clean installs please move forward to 2022.7.421\n \n## Notable updates\n \n- Added C:\\ProgramData\\Cloudflare\\cfwarp_daemon_dns.txt log file when DNS logging is enabled\n- Added `do not fragment` bit to WARP tunnel traffic\n- Added ability for posture rules that support file paths to use environment variables as part of the path\n- Modified Zero Trust authentication flow to no longer rely on WebView2 embedded experience and use default browser instead\n- Modified output of `warp-cli account` and `warp-cli settings` to make parsing information easier\n- Modified client UI during re-authentication flow to always appear as the top most window so it is less likely users will miss it\n- Fixed major issue introduced with 2022.5.341 where IPv6 traffic was no longer consistently routed through the tunnel\n- Fixed issue where warp-svc.exe may not start due to missing VCRUNTIME140.dll on some systems\n- Fixed issue that could result in broken DNS for users running WiFi until an admin manually reset DNS back to default\n- Fixed issue where the UI could appear stretched when using an external monitor\n- Fixed issue where warp-cli could be used determine a valid admin override code\n- Fixed issue where warp-cli could be used to enable/disable on wifi networks when in Zero Trust mode\n- Fixed issue where the UI could get a barrage of notifications when coming out of modern standby\n- Fixed issue where you would receive a notification immediately after install that your internet was no longer private\n- Fixed issue with domain based split tunnels when a wildcard is used. Anything after the `*` was included in the wildcard search so `*.example.com` would include  `badexample.com`\n- Fixed issue where client was sending improper ICMP responses when MTU needed to change\n- Fixed UI issue when going between light/dark modes\n- Fixed issue where logs could grow too large\n \n## Known issues\n- This version requires at least Windows 10.0.19042. If you are running a prior version of Windows, please delay upgrading.\n- Zero Trust users who perform a clean install of the client utilizing msi parameters will result in the GUI being in a broken state and not asking for authentication. This is fixed in 2022.7.421\n\n\nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n \nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/",
