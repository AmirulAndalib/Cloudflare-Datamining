This allows users to more easily switch between production and test environments or for China users to switch between their override endpoints within the UI.\n- Added the ability for administrators to allow their end users to temporarily obtain access to local network resources in the event their home IP space overlaps with traffic normally routed through the WARP tunnel.\n- Improved existing re-auth notifications to be more visible and time sensitive.\n- Improved the handling of DNS server addresses to avoid conflicts with Windows OS setting of DHCP-sourced DNS server addresses.\n- Improved the retry mechanisms for DEX test results.\n- Improved the Device Posture Firewall check on Windows to ensure that all policy stores are checked.\n- Fixed an issue where DEX tests would run before the client was fully connected.\n\n## Known issues\n- When `Install CA to system certificate store` is enabled, the certificate is not always properly left behind in `%ProgramData%\\Cloudflare\\installed_cert.pem`. This issue will be fixed in a future release.\n\nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
