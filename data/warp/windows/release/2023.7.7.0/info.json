We strongly encourage customers with domain based split tunneling rules to upgrade to this version.\r\n \r\n## Notable updates\r\n- Added more status messages to the UI when the client is unable to connect\r\n- Added support for \"SWG without DNS Filtering\" mode. All DNS functionality from the WARP client is disabled while in this service mode \r\n- Improved performance of the client when in the \"Proxy Only\" service mode\r\n- Improved performance of domain-based split tunneling when the IP was already split tunneled (seen frequently with Zoom domains and IPs being used)\r\n- Modified `warp-cli settings` to show if the applied settings came from local (mdm) or network (warp settings profile) policy to make debugging profile issues easier\r\n- Fixed an issue that could result in increased latency when resolving queries\r\n- Fixed an issue where the GUI could indicate the incorrect service mode after entering an admin override code\r\n- Fixed an issue with re-authentication policies that could result in the browser loading a broken URL\r\n- Optimized the performance of DNS queries to prevent minor memory leaks\r\n- Fixed an issue when service token information was removed from an mdm.xml file the client would not prompt for user authentication as expected\r\n- Fixed an issue where localhost DNS proxy could not be set properly in certain VPN and VM configuration\r\n- Fixed localization issues in en-MX UI that caused longer strings to get truncated\r\n- Fixed an issue with certain tools like nslookup that was introduced in previous beta where DNS could appear broken\r\n- Fixed an issue where the WARP Client wouldn't properly detect if IPv6 was disabled via \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip6\\Parameters\"\r\n- Fixed an issue where onboarding being set to False would not work if the GUI app started before the service \r\n- Fixed an issue where the client would attempt to connect even when the \"AUTO CONNEC",
