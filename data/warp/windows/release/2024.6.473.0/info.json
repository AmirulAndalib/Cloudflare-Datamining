The workaround is to use the `warp-cli registration delete` command to clear the registration, and then re-register the client.\r\n- There are certain known limitations preventing the use of the MASQUE tunnel protocol in certain scenarios. Do not use the MASQUE tunnel protocol if:\r\n  - A Magic WAN integration is on the account and is not yet migrated to the warp_unified_flow. Please check migration status with your account team.\r\n  - Your account has Regional Services enabled.\r\n   \r\nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp  \r\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\r\n",
