The qlog setting from previous releases will no longer be respected.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n- DNS resolution may be broken when the following conditions are all true:\r\n  - WARP is in Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering (tunnel-only) mode.\r\n  - A custom DNS server address is configured on the primary network adapter.\r\n  - The custom DNS server address on the primary network adapter is changed while WARP is connected.\r\n\r\n  To work around this issue, please reconnect the WARP client by toggling off and back on",
