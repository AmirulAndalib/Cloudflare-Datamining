In particular, we have made significant changes to how local settings (MDM) are processed and how they work with new devices settings in the dashboard.\n\n**Notable updates** \n- Added support for Gateway session duration enforcement allowing you to force re-authentication after a specified time.\n- Fixed issue where context menu would remain after you quit the GUI.\n- Fixed wake from sleep issue where DNS requests could fail.\n- Improved overall stability of Windows installer.\n\n**Known issues** \n- If you change organizations by pushing a new mdm.xml file while the user is already logged in to an organization the client will get in to a bad state and need to be uninstalled.\n- Any change to the mdm.xml file will require the user to re-authenticate when they shouldn't have to.\n",
