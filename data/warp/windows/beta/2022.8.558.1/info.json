Please note that the issue preventing the client from working with Windows versions older than 10.0.19042 is now fixed in this release. We also wanted to call out that we've made server side changes to significantly reduce captcha issues for users with IPv6 enabled (no client related change but wanted to call out the work).\n \n## Notable updates\n \n- Modified GUI app to now be built on .Net 6.0 as .Net 5.0 is now end of life and upgraded the internal version of our upgrade engine (Sparkle).
