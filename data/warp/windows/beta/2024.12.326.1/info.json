Once a user completes Windows log in, all traffic to Cloudflare will be attributed to the currently active Windows user account. Contact your Customer Success Manager to request participation in this beta.\n\n## Known issues\n- DNS resolution may be broken when the following conditions are all true:\n  - WARP is in Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering (tunnel-only) mode.\n  - A custom DNS server address is configured on the primary network adapter.\n  - The custom DNS server address on the primary network adapter is changed while WARP is connected.\n\n  To work around this issue, please reconnect the WARP client by toggling off and back on.\n\nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\n\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\n",
