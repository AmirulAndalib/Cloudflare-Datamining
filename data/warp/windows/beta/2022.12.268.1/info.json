	"release_notes": "This release contains bug fixes and a new UI `Connectivity` panel in preferences (Windows only at the moment) to assist with debugging. Please give it a try and let us know how it works!\r\n \r\n## Notable updates\r\n- New `Connectivity` tab in the GUI bubbles up helpful information (Windows only for now). Please let us know how this works for you.\r\n- Improved captive portal handling for some more captive portals.\r\n- Improved reconnect logic when a setting changes to no longer always do a full disconnect->reconnect cycle (for instance when turning on DNS logging).\r\n- Modified initial connectivity check behavior to now validate both IPv4 and IPv6 are working (previously we only checked IPv4). Test will pass if either connects successfully.\r\n- Fixed issue where UI could appear hung.\r\n- Fixed issue where progress bar won't appear during update until update is completed.\r\n- Fixed issue where client could be stuck on `Connecting` if certain DNS checks failed once.\r\n- Fixed DNS issue where TXT records were not being correctly returned when at the end of a CNAME chain.\r\n- Fixed issue where the client may not receive notifications of new settings, re-auth events or posture from the service until reboot.\r\n- Fixed issue where users could be pointing at an old gateway_doh_subdomain if you have `Allowed to Leave` set to true and they've manually joined their client to your organization.\r\n- Fixed slow DNS timeout issue that could occur when IPv6 is enabled and an NXDOMAIN record is returned.\r\n- Fixed issue with `Gateway with DoH` mode could say `Connected` when it wasn't really connected as we could sometimes test the wrong endpoint.\r\n- Fixed issue where our local DNS proxy server could get unset with an overly active DHCP renew time or by plugging in/out a tethered device.\r\n- Fixed issue where if `support_url` doesn't have a protocol definitely we now automatically add `https`\r\n- Fixed issue where the Cloudflare WARP system Service may crash if a long running child process crashes (such as ipconfig, netsh, etc.)\r\n \r\n \r\n## Known issues\r\n- No known issues\r\n \r\nFor Zero Trust documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp\r\n \r\nFor Consumer documentation please see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/\r\n",
