This error was introduced with the 2023.3 GA release and happens more frequently with larger split tunnel configurations, especially on more resource constrained machines. We are actively working on a fix. Until then we recommend staying on 2022.12 GA release OR reducing your split tunnel configuration if possible.\r\n",
