What the rules you created are affecting is traffic to **your origin server**, e.g. the Firewall rule you created will block any web request passing through Cloudflare trying to access any port other than 80/443 for your domain.\n\n In order to make this judgement in a WAF rule, it is imperative that a client first connects to the port on our Edge, performs the TLS handshake and sends the HTTP request to a URL of this port.

Check the domain expiry**\n\n\n\nIf your domain is due to expire within 15 days (or within 10 days for `.uk` TLDs), you must first renew the domain at your current domain registrar. Once you have done this, you can then transfer to Cloudflare Registrar.\n\n\n\n**4.

Visit the <a href='https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/' target='_blank'>Dashboard</a> - if you do not see `Active` underneath your domain name, click the domain name and follow the on screen instructions.

You will not be able to start a transfer to another Registrar if you see any of the following listed:\n\n\n\n* clientTransferProhibited\n\n* serverTransferProhibited\n\n* serverHold\n\n\n\nYou must contact your current Registrar to ensure these statuses are removed before you can start a transfer to Cloudflare Registrar.\n\n\n\n**6.
