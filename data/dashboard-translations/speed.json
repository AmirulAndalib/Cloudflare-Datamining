	"sxg.card.help": "**Signed HTTP exchanges** are an open, standard delivery mechanism that make it possible to authenticate the origin of a resource, independent of how it was delivered. This decoupling enables a variety of use cases, such as prefetching, offline Internet experiences, and serving from third-party caches. It does so in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, and Cloudflare automatically handles all packaging and certificate handling. [Learn more](https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatic-signed-exchanges)",
	"sxg.card.help2": "### What are the requirements for enabling SXGs?\n\n* SXGs are available for zones with a Pro or higher plan. SXGs are also available for zones on a Free plan with an APO subscription. \n* SXGs only works with zones that have their nameservers managed by Cloudflare. Learn [here how to change your domain nameservers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup) to Cloudflare. After enabling your nameservers to be managed by Cloudflare, [log in to the Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), select your domain and go to DNS. In Proxy status, enable the Cloudflare proxy in any relevant DNS records by clicking the grey clouds. When proxied through Cloudflare, the cloud will be orange.\n* Zone certificates need to be managed by Cloudflare.\n\t* **Note**: To obtain an SXG certificate, you need to add a CAA Record for issuance of the certificate from the Certificate Authority. Cloudflare adds the corresponding CAA records in DNS on behalf of users after they enable SXGs, to make sure issuance is not blocked. If you would like to obtain SSL certificates that are issued by other CAs, please ensure that you add the CAA records for the CAs after enabling the SXG.\n* Content needs to be cached in intervals of 120 seconds or longer, as Google checks this setting to generate an SXG. To ensure that content is cached every two minutes or more, go to the `Cloudflare dashboard > Caching > Configuration > Browser Cache TTL` and check the length of time Cloudflare instructs a browser to cache files. \n* AMP Real URL needs to be disabled if SXGs is enabled. To do that, go to the `Cloudflare dashboard > Speed > Optimization > AMP Real URL` and click the toggle to disable this setting.\n\n### Limitations\n\n* Currently, signed exchanges are only used by Google for Android search. Google is working on implementing support for SXGs on desktop browsers.\n* Google only loads Signed Exchanges for the top results.\n* Signed exchanges can strip out certain cookies and headers, and create problems with dynamic content. The following hop-by-hop and other uncached headers will be stripped during the signed exchange generation:\n\t1. Hop-by-hop header fields listed in the Connection header field ([Section 6.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-6.1) of [RFC7230](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230)).\n\t2. Header fields listed in the no-cache response directive in the Cache-Control header field ([Section 5.2.2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7234#section-5.2.2.2) of [RFC7234](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7234)).\n\t3. Header fields defined as hop-by-hop:\n\t\t* `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`, `Proxy-Connection Trailer`, `Transfer-Encoding`, `Upgrade`\n* Since Cloudflare cannot be sure whether a signed exchange does or does not include private information, a signed exchange will not be generated in the presence of the following headers:\n\t* `Authentication-Control`, `Authentication-Info`, `Clear-Site-Data`, `Optional-WWW-Authenticate`, `Proxy-Authenticate`, `Proxy-Authentication-Info`, `Public-Key-Pins`, `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`, `Set-Cookie`, `Set-Cookie2`, `SetProfile`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Vary`, `WWW-Authenticate`\n\n### FAQs\n\n* [In this page](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411386879629-Automatic-Signed-Exchanges-SXGs-Beta-FAQ), you will find the answers to the most commonly asked questions regarding Automatic Signed Exchanges.",
