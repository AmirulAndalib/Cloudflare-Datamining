We recommend starting out at Medium.\n\n- **Essentially off:** Challenges only the most grievous offenders\n- **Low:** Challenges only the most threatening visitors\n- **Medium:** Challenges both moderate threat visitors and the most threatening visitors\n- **High:** Challenges all visitors that have exhibited threatening behavior within the last 14 days\n- **I'm Under Attack!:**  Should only be used if your website is under a DDoS attack\n  - Visitors will receive an interstitial page while we analyze their traffic and behavior to make sure they are a legitimate human visitor trying to access your website\n\n**Note:** I'm Under Attack! may affect some actions on your domain. For example, it may block access to your API. You can set a custom security level for any part of your domain using Page Rules.",
