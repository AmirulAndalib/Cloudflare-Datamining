	"description": "When `?sample=` is provided, a sample of matching records is returned. If `sample=0.1` then 10% of records will be returned. Sampling is random: repeated calls will not only return different records, but likely will also vary slightly in number of returned records. When `?count=` is also specified, `count` is applied to the number of returned records, not the sampled records. So, with `sample=0.05` and `count=7`, when there is a total of 100 records available, approximately five will be returned. When there are 1000 records, seven will be returned. When there are 10,000 records, seven will be returned.",
