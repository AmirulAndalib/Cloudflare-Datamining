	"description": "Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. This is a template html file that will be rendered at the edge. If no custom_page_html is provided, the default waiting room will be used. The template is based on mustache ( https://mustache.github.io/ ). There are several variables that are evaluated by the Cloudflare edge:\n1. {{`waitTimeKnown`}} Acts like a boolean value that indicates the behavior to take when wait time is not available, for instance when queue_all is **true**. \n2. {{`waitTimeFormatted`}} Estimated wait time for the user. For example, five minutes. Alternatively, you can use: \n3. {{`waitTime`}} Number of minutes of estimated wait for a user.\n4. {{`waitTimeHours`}} Number of hours of estimated wait for a user (`Math.floor(waitTime/60)`). \n5. {{`waitTimeHourMinutes`}} Number of minutes above the `waitTimeHours` value (`waitTime%60`). \n6. {{`queueIsFull`}} Changes to **true** when no more people can be added to the queue.\n\nTo view the full list of variables, look at the `cfWaitingRoom` object described under the `json_response_enabled` property in other Waiting Room API calls.",
