	"description": "Rocket Loader is a general-purpose asynchronous JavaScript optimisation that prioritises rendering your content while loading your site's Javascript asynchronously. Turning on Rocket Loader will immediately improve a web page's rendering time sometimes measured as Time to First Paint (TTFP), and also the `window.onload` time (assuming there is JavaScript on the page). This can have a positive impact on your Google search ranking. When turned on, Rocket Loader will automatically defer the loading of all Javascript referenced in your HTML, with no configuration required. Refer to [Understanding Rocket Loader](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200168056) for more information.",
