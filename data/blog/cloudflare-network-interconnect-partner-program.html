	<p>Today we’re excited to announce Cloudflare’s Network Interconnection <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect-partnerships">Partner Program</a>, in support of our new CNI <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-interconnect">product</a>. As ever more enterprises turn to Cloudflare to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/network-security">secure</a> and accelerate their branch and core networks, the ability to connect privately and securely becomes increasingly important. Today's announcement significantly increases the interconnection options for our customers, allowing them to connect with us in the location of their choice using the method or vendors they prefer.</p>
	<p>In addition to our <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/net/4224">physical locations</a>, our customers can now interconnect with us at any of 23 metro areas across five continents using <b>software-defined layer 2 networking technology</b>. Following the recent release of CNI (which includes PNI support for Magic Transit), customers can now order layer 3 DDoS protection in any of the markets below, without requiring physical cross connects, providing <b>private and secure</b> links, with <b>simpler setup</b>.</p>
	<h3>Launch Partners</h3>
	<p>We’re very excited to announce that five of the world's premier interconnect platforms are available at launch. <a href="http://www.consoleconnect.com"><b>Console Connect by PCCW Global</b></a> in 14 locations, <a href="https://www.megaport.com"><b>Megaport</b></a> in 14 locations, <a href="https://packetfabric.com"><b>PacketFabric</b></a> in 15 locations, <a href="https://www.equinix.com/interconnection-services/cloud-exchange-fabric"><b>Equinix ECX Fabric</b>™</a> in 8 locations and <a href="http://zayo.com"><b>Zayo Tranzact</b></a> in 3 locations, spanning North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa.</p>
	<h3></h3>
	<p>What is an Interconnection Platform?</p>
	<p>Like much of the networking world, there are many terms in the interconnection space for the same thing: Cloud Exchange, Virtual Cross Connect Platform and Interconnection Platform are all synonyms. They are platforms that allow two networks to interconnect privately at layer 2, without requiring additional physical cabling. Instead the customer can order a port and a virtual connection on a dashboard, and the interconnection ‘fabric’ will establish the connection. Since many large customers are already connected to these fabrics for their connections to traditional Cloud providers, it is a very convenient method to establish private connectivity with Cloudflare.</p>

	<h3>Why interconnect virtually?</h3>
	<p>Cloudflare has an extensive <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-peering-portal-beta">peering</a> infrastructure and already has private links to thousands of other networks. Virtual private interconnection is particularly attractive to customers with strict security postures and demanding performance requirements, but without the added burden of ordering and managing additional physical cross connects and expanding their physical infrastructure.</p>
	<h3>Key Benefits of Interconnection Platforms</h3>
	<p><b>Secure</b>Similar to physical PNI, traffic does not pass across the Internet. Rather, it flows from the customer router, to the Interconnection Platform’s network and ultimately to Cloudflare. So while there is still some element of shared infrastructure, it’s not over the public Internet.</p>
	<p><b>Efficient</b>Modern PNIs are typically a minimum of 1Gbps, but if you have the security motivation without the sustained 1Gbps data transfer rates, then you will have idle capacity. Virtual connections provide for “sub-rate” speeds, which means less than 1Gbps, such as 100Mbps, meaning you only pay for what you use. Most providers also allow some level of “burstiness”, which is to say you can exceed that 100Mbps limit for short periods.</p>
	<p><b>Performance</b>By avoiding the public Internet, virtual links avoid Internet congestion.</p>
	<p><b>Price</b>The major cloud providers typically have different pricing for egressing data to the Internet compared to an Interconnect Platform. By connecting to your cloud via an Interconnect Partner, you can benefit from those reduced egress fees between your cloud and the Interconnection Platform. This builds on our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance">Bandwidth Alliance</a> to give customers more options to continue to drive down their network costs.</p>
	<p><b>Less Overhead</b>By virtualizing, you reduce physical cable management to just one connection into the Interconnection Platform. From there, everything defined and managed in software. For example, ordering a 100Mbps link to Cloudflare can be a few clicks in a Dashboard, as would be a 100Mbps link into Salesforce.</p>
	<p><b>Data Center Independence</b>Is your infrastructure in the same metro, but in a different facility to Cloudflare? An Interconnection Platform can bring us together without the need for additional physical links.</p>
