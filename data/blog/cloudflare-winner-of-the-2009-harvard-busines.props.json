We're extremely excited and<br>\nflattered by the recognition. The competition was a terrific experience<br>\nfor Michelle and me. The process of putting together the plan helped us<br>\nunderstand where the real need in the market for a new performance and<br>\nsecurity solution was -- for small- to mid-sized sites -- as well as to<br>\ncome up with a way to deploy a solution that met the needs of those<br>\nsites. We have had a ton of in-bound interest from venture capital firms<br>\nwho want to work with us on taking Cloudflare from a plan to a product.<br>\nStay tuned for what's next!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Cloudflare: Winner of the 2009 Harvard Business School Business Plan\nCompetition\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/team_cloudflare_hbs.jpg.scaled.500.jpg\" title=\"CloudFlare: Winner of the 2009 Harvard Business School Business Plan Competition\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cloudflare: Winner of the 2009 Harvard Business School Business Plan\nCompetition\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/team_cloudflare_hbs.jpg.scaled.500.jpg\" title=\"Cloudflare: Winner of the 2009 Harvard Business School Business Plan Competition\"></noscript></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
