	<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/troymccas">Troy McCasland</a> is the co founder and Vice President of Business Development at <a href="https://www.attracta.com">Attracta</a>. He has been at the company since its inception, working on the executive management team and building the business.</p>
	<p>We sat down with Troy at HostingCon and asked, what exactly does Attracta do? "Attracta makes the worlds most popular search engine optimization platform," said Troy. "We solve a really big problem for every host here at HostingCon."</p>
	<p>According to Troy, if a customer purchases a site through a host and then searches for their site in Google, only to find their site isn't there, it can be a big problem for the host. Attracta solves that problem by crawling the site and offering a XML Sitemap of the site to major search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Ask.</p>
	<p>Attracta currently has more than 2.3 million customers and adds over 100,000 customers a month.</p>
