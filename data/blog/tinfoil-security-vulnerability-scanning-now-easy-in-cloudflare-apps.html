	<p>We’re pleased to introduce a new CloudFlare App: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/tinfoil_security?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Tinfoil Security</a>. Tinfoil Security is a service designed to find possible web application vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p>Security is central to CloudFlare's service. Our security features operate at the network level to identify and block malicious traffic from ever reaching your website or application. However, even with that protection in place, it’s still worth fixing problems at the application layer as well.</p>
	<p>Tinfoil Security helps website owners learn about possible vulnerabilities in their applications by scanning for vulnerabilities, tests all access points, and providing step-by-step introductions on eliminating threats if found.</p>

	<p>Their developer-focused reports can be tied into continuous integration lifecycle with API hooks for kicking off new scans after changes are made.</p>
	<p>Tinfoil offers several price points, including a free plan that checks for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) concerns. The Tinfoil app is a quick and easy addition to your CloudFlare service. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/tinfoil_security?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Take a look</a>!</p>
