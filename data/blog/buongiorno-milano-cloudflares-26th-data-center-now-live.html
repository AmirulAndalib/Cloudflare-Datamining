		<small>Team Italy exiting the data center after racking and cabling servers (in style)</small>
	</p>
	<p>Italy is known for many great things. First and foremost, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team" target="_blank">Azzurri</a>—2006 World Cup champions and (as of yesterday) dashers of England's world cup hopes—but also the Colosseum, the fountains of Florence, the canals of Venice, the Alps, Lambos, pizza, pasta, the good life in Tuscany, Michelangelo, da Vinci, the leaning tower of Pisa, opera, fashion and, of course, colorful gestures. And not forgetting some of the world's largest companies and brands like Luxottica Group, Finmeccanica, Gucci, Prada, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Bulgari, Barilla, Chicco, Lamborghini, Pirelli and Ferrero.</p>
	<h3 id="thatsnomoreeh">That's "No more!", eh?</h3>
	<p>It is with great pride, and song, that we add CloudFlare's latest data center to the list.</p>
	<p><em>(to the tune of “That’s Amore” by Dean Martin)</em><br><br>

	<ol class="poem in2">
		<li>When you've had quite enough of this latency stuff,</li>
		<li>That’s “No more!”, eh?</li>
		<li>When it seems deja vu, DoS is comin' for you</li>
		<li>That’s “No more!”, eh?</li>
		<li>Alarm bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling</li>
		<li>And you’ll sleep like a baby...</li>
		<li>First things first, the origin is cursed, fear the worst</li>
		<li>Only to realize you have CloudFlare...</li>
