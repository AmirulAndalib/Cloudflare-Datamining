With Workers, you can quickly solve problems without having to wonder: “is this going to scale?”</p><p>You write the JavaScript and we handle the rest, from distribution to scaling and concurrency.</p><p>In the spirit of quickly solving problems, we’re excited to launch three new improvements to the Workers experience, so you can take your next idea and ship it even faster.</p><h3 id=\"introducing-workers-new\">Introducing... workers.new</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/04/unnamed-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Address Bar\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>First, we’re introducing <a href=\"https://workers.new\">https://workers.new</a>, a shortcut that takes you directly to a JavaScript editor for creating a new Worker. Anytime you have a cool idea, need a quick fix to a problem, or just want to debug some JavaScript, you now have a simple way to go from idea to prototype. What’s more is you don’t even need to deploy the Worker to try it out!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/04/unnamed-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>We’ve also updated the default Worker template to help you go a few steps beyond the typical “Hello, World!”. When you open the editor, you’ll now see a few examples that demonstrate how to redirect requests, modify headers, and parse responses.</p><h3 id=\"customize-your-build-scripts\">Customize your build scripts</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/04/unnamed--1--2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Wrangler Crab\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>For developers who want to deploy more complex applications, like those with external libraries or written in other languages like TypeScript, we recommend using our command-line tool, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler#-wrangler\">wrangler</a>.</p><p>Previously, wrangler has supported three project types: JavaScript, Rust, and webpack. By far, we’ve found that webpack is the most widely used among the community, since it has built-in support for bundling npm packages. Yet, as more developers started to use wrangler, they’ve wanted to customize their webpack configurations or even use other JavaScript bundlers.</p><p>That’s why we’re excited to release custom builds for wrangler! Now you can provide wrangler with a custom build script and upload directory, which works with all of the wrangler commands including <code>wrangler dev</code> and <code>wrangler publish</code>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/04/unnamed-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Sample Script\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>This means you can use any JavaScript bundler you want: webpack, Rollup, Parcel, esbuild, and many more! We’ve put together a few templates that you can copy if you want to get started with custom builds. Make sure to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update#update\">update</a> wrangler to release 1.16 or later and check out our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/configuration#build\">documentation</a> about custom builds and additional configuration options.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/service-worker-custom-build\">webpack</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-webpack-commonjs\">webpack with Durable Objects</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/modules-rollup-esm\">Rollup</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-rollup-esm\">Rollup with Durable Objects</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"viewing-logs-and-exceptions\">Viewing logs and exceptions</h3><p>Ever wanted to see the <code>console.log()</code> output or uncaught exceptions from a deployed Worker?</p><p>In case you missed it, <code>wrangler tail</code> allows you to see a live stream of your Worker’s logs and exceptions. Today, we’re improving <code>wrangler tail</code> by making it easier to use and more accessible to developers.</p><p>First, we wanted to improve the terminal output. Previously, <code>wrangler tail</code> would only output log entries as JSON. While this was useful when piping through to tools like <code>jq</code>, it was generally hard to digest. That’s why we created a new “pretty” format that is much easier to read and takes full advantage of your terminal’s color codes.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ wrangler tail --format=&lt;json|pretty&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/04/unnamed--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Sample Code\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>If you have suggestions for how we can improve <code>wrangler tail</code>, feel free to pop in the #wrangler channel on the Workers <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev\">Discord</a>. We’re excited to see what you ship with these improvements!</p><h3 id=\"a-sneak-preview\">A sneak preview</h3><p>As we like to say at Cloudflare, we’re just getting started. While we have plans to add improvements to wrangler... where else could we introduce logs?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/04/image3-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Dashboard Logs\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Stay tuned.</p>",
