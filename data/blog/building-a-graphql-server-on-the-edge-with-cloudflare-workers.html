	<p>Today, we're open-sourcing an exciting project that showcases the strengths of our Cloudflare Workers platform: <code>workers-graphql-server</code> is a batteries-included <a href="https://apollographql.com">Apollo GraphQL</a> server, designed to get you up and running quickly with <a href="https://graphql.com">GraphQL</a>.</p>

	<p>Testing GraphQL queries in the GraphQL Playground</p>
	<p>As a full-stack developer, I’m really excited about GraphQL. I love building user interfaces with <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a>, but as a project gets more complex, it can become really difficult to manage how your data is managed inside an application. GraphQL makes that really easy — instead of having to recall the REST URL structure of your backend API, or remember when your backend server doesn't <i>quite</i> follow REST conventions — you just tell GraphQL what data you want, and it takes care of the rest.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare Workers is uniquely suited as a platform to being an incredible place to host a GraphQL server. Because your code is running on Cloudflare's servers around the world, the average latency for your requests is extremely low, and by using <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler">Wrangler</a>, our open-source command line tool for building and managing Workers projects, you can deploy new versions of your GraphQL server around the world within seconds.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to try the GraphQL server, check out a demo GraphQL playground, <a href="https://graphql-on-workers.signalnerve.com/___graphql">deployed on Workers.dev</a>. This optional add-on to the GraphQL server allows you to experiment with GraphQL queries and mutations, giving you a super powerful way to understand how to interface with your data, without having to hop into a codebase.</p>
	<p>If you're ready to get started building your own GraphQL server with our new open-source project, we've added a new tutorial to our <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/docs">Workers documentation</a> to help you get up and running — <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/quickstarts#frameworks">check it out here</a>!</p>
	<p>Finally, if you're interested in <i>how</i> the project works, or want to help contribute — it's open-source! We'd love to hear your feedback and see your contributions. Check out the project <a href="https://github.com/signalnerve/workers-graphql-server">on GitHub</a>.</p>
