	<p>CloudFlare has released a new version of our plugin for cPanel with two new features and more control over the security settings of your website.</p>
	<p>The new plugin (v6.0) uses the latest cPanel PHP-based APIs, and is completely re-architected to make adding new features easier, allowing for more frequent updates.</p>
	<p>We’ve always focused on making integration with CloudFlare as easy as possible. As a customer of one of our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners">hosting partners</a> you can quickly start using CloudFlare features and routing your website traffic through CloudFlare’s global network by clicking on the CloudFlare icon from your cPanel interface.</p>

	<h3>New features offering stronger protection</h3>
	<p>Add domains to CloudFlare through <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203685674-Full-setup-versus-Partial-CNAME-setup">Full Zone Provisioning</a>. A huge benefit of Full Zone Provisioning is that it enables all of CloudFlare’s protection, including DDoS mitigation, at the root domain (yourdomain.com) as well the subdomain (<a href="http://www.yourdomain.com">www.yourdomain.com</a>).</p>
	<p>If your website is experiencing Layer 7 DDoS attacks, you can now click on the '<i>Enable “I'm under attack" mode</i> ’ button to filter out malicious traffic while allowing legitimate visitors to reach your site. When this is in place, visitors will receive a temporary page for about five seconds while we analyze the traffic to make sure it is a legitimate human visitor.</p>
	<h3>More control over security settings</h3>
	<p>You can now control more CloudFlare security settings right from cPanel:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Select the basic security level of your site from <i>Essentially Off</i>, <i>Low</i>, <i>Medium</i>, or <i>High</i></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Configure the <i>Challenge Passage</i> which specifies how long a visitor is allowed access to your website after completing a challenge</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Enable <i>Browser Integrity Check</i> which evaluates HTTP headers from your visitors browser for threats, if a threat is found a block page will be delivered</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Performance benefits</h3>
	<p>You can also control your website’s performance settings from within cPanel:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Set the caching level and purge the cache</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Enable <i>Auto-minify</i>, where you can choose whether you want to compress the size of CSS, Javascript, HTML (even dynamic HTML), or any combination of the three</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Toggle <i>Development Mode</i> ON/OFF, which temporarily bypasses the cache allowing you to see changes to your origin server in realtime</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
