You make<br>\nplans like that in order to give you some sense of a light at the end of<br>\nthe very long tunnel that is building a startup, but it's rare that<br>\nthings actually work out as you plan. We thought we were onto something<br>\nspecial based on the feedback from our early beta users, but Cloudflare<br>\nwas really a long shot for TechCrunch. We're a tough story to tell,<br>\nwe're not the typical TechCrunch consumer Internet company, and, as Mike<br>\nArrington said on stage right before we won the award for &quot;Most<br>\nInnovative Company,&quot; we're a bit &quot;boring&quot; and doing something akin to<br>\n&quot;muffler repair&quot; for the Internet.</p>\n<p>Turns out the Internet has had a broken muffler for a while, and seeing<br>\nthe pent up demand for a service like Cloudflare has been awesome. In<br>\nthe seven days since our launch, the traffic through our network has<br>\nincreased almost 10x and, if you measure all the page views or unique<br>\nvisitors passing through our site, in one week we went from the 1,000th<br>\nlargest site online to one of the top 50. We now power more page views<br>\nand see more unique visitors than a major site like CNN.com. That's<br>\npretty amazing.</p>\n<p>If you're a startup and you get a chance to launch at a TechCrunch<br>\nconference, I can't recommend it more highly. Heather, Erick, Mike, and<br>\neveryone else on the TechCrunch team were professional and worked hard<br>\nto make sure we told Cloudflare's story in as compelling a way as<br>\npossible. The launch of a startup is a sacred event. You only get to do<br>\nit once. We couldn't have been happier with how Cloudflare's went, and<br>\nwe can't wait to tell everyone what we're up to next!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Reflections on TechCrunch Disrupt\nLaunch\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/TC_Disrupt_Ridiculously_Easy.jpg.scaled.500.jpg\" title=\"Reflections on TechCrunch Disrupt Launch\"><noscript></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
