	<p>On September 16 2015 at 10:00AM PST, Apple released their latest update to the iPhone: iOS 9. For several days after the announcement, ISPs and customers reported problems downloading iOS 9 due to overloaded servers. Obviously, the demand for iOS 9 was higher than even Apple anticipated, but how much higher? Few organizations outside of Apple have any idea what the actual iOS 9 adoption rates look like.</p>
	<p>By analyzing the user agent strings of requests passing through the CloudFlare network, we were able to piece together a pretty good picture of iOS 9 uptake. Here’s an hour-by-hour look at requests from iOS 8 devices (blue) and iOS 9 devices (orange) for the first 24 hours after the announcement.</p>

	<p>We started seeing small amounts of iOS 9 usage <em>before</em> it was officially released, followed by a spike immediately after the launch (times are shown in UTC, so the 10:00AM announcement shows up as hour 18). You can also see a second spike at 10:00 UTC when Europe started waking up.</p>
	<h3 id="whataboutios91">What about iOS 9.1?</h3>
	<p>Even though the official release was for iOS 9.0, we also found beta iOS 9.1 in the wild. Curious about the comparative traffic between the two?</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/09/image_1.jpg" alt="iOS 9.1 beta traffic during launch" loading="lazy"></p>
	<p>iOS 9.0 is shown in blue, while 9.1 is shown in orange. As you can see, 9.0 adoption exploded after Apple’s official launch, while the 9.1 beta requests remained steady.</p>
	<h3 id="currentadoptionrates">Current Adoption Rates</h3>
	<p>Fast-forward five days, and it’s clear that iOS 9 adoption didn’t slow down after the launch. As of September 21st, the relative traffic of iOS 9 (orange) to iOS 8 (blue) on the CloudFlare network is around 30-35%.</p>

	<h3 id="ipv6andios9">IPv6 and iOS 9</h3>
	<p>A key part of the iOS 9 announcement was that all iOS apps running on 9.0+ will require IPv6 support. The IPv4 address space is nearly exhausted, and switching to IPv6 is the only way to keep adding more devices to the global Internet.</p>
	<p>iOS 9’s IPv6 requirement compliments CloudFlare’s mission to make a better Internet. We’ve been doing our part to encourage IPv6 adoption by providing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ipv6?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">free IPv6 support</a> to all web properties on our network.</p>
	<p>Although it’s still pretty early, we can already see an uptick in IPv6 requests due to iOS 9:</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/09/image_3.png" alt="iOS 9 vs iOS 8 IPv6 traffic" loading="lazy"></p>
	<p>The first chart shows the number of IPv4 vs. IPv6 requests for iOS 8, while the second shows iOS 9. Even after only a few days, we’re seeing a 1.07% increase in IPv6 requests thanks to iOS 9.</p>
	<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
	<p>Seeing over 5% of global Internet requests gives us an interesting perspective on current events. We get to watch the worldwide impact of everything from product launches like iOS 9 to hiccups in the Internet infrastructure like the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-internet-is-a-cooperative-system-dns-outage-of-6-july-2015/">Dyn outage</a> of last July and even <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-syria-turned-off-the-internet/">governments turning off the Internet</a>. We try our best to use our unique vantage point to better the Internet as a whole and raise awareness for critical technologies like IPv6.</p>
