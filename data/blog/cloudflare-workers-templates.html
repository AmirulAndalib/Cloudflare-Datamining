	<p>One of the things we prioritize at Cloudflare is enabling developers to build their applications on our developer platform with ease. Weâ€™re excited to share a collection of ready-made templates thatâ€™ll help you start building your next application on Workers. We want developers to get started as quickly as possible, so that they can focus on building and innovating and avoid spending so much time configuring and setting up their projects.</p>
	<h3 id="introducing-cloudflare-workers-templates">Introducing <a href="https://workers.new/templates">Cloudflare Workers Templates</a></h3>
	<p><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Workers</a> enables you to build applications with exceptional performance, reliability, and scale. We are excited to share a collection of templates that helps you get started quickly and give you an idea of what is possible to build on our developer platform.</p>
	<p>We have made available a set of starter templates highlighting different use cases of Workers. We understand that you have different ideas you will love to build on top of Workers and you may have questions or wonder if it is possible. These sets of templates go beyond the convention â€˜Hello, Worldâ€™ starter. Theyâ€™ll help shape your idea of what kind of applications you can build with Workers as well as other products in the Cloudflare Developer Ecosystem.</p>
	<p>We are excited to introduce a new collection of starter templates <a href="https://workers.new/templates">workers.new/templates</a>. This shortcut will serve you a collection of templates that you can immediately start using to build your next application.</p>

	<h3 id="how-to-use-cloudflare-workers-templates">How to use Cloudflare Workers templates</h3>
	<p>We created this collection of templates to support you in getting started with Workers. Some examples listed showcase a use-case with a combination of multiple Cloudflare developer platform products to build applications similar to ones you might use every day. We know that Workers are being used today for different use-cases, we want to showcase some of them to you.</p>
	<p>We have templates for building an <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/pages-image-sharing">image sharing website with Pages Functions</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/stream/upload/direct-creator-uploads">direct creator upload to Cloudflare Stream</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/worker-example-request-scheduler">Durable Object-powered request scheduler</a> and many more.</p>
	<p>One example to highlight is a template that lets you accept payment for video content. It is powered by <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions">Pages Functions</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream">Cloudflare Stream</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/en-gb-nl/payments/checkout">Stripe Checkout</a>. Â&nbsp;This app shows how you can use Cloudflare Workers with external payment and authentication systems to create a logged-in experience, without ever having to manage a database or persist any state yourself.</p>
	<p>Once a user has paid, Stripe Checkout redirects to a URL that verifies a token from Stripe, and generates a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/viewing-videos/securing-your-stream">signed URL</a> using Cloudflare Stream to view the video. This signed URL is only valid for a specified amount of time, and access can be restricted by country or IP address.</p>
	<p>To use the template, you need to either click the deploy with Workers button or open the template with Stackblitz.</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/11/image4-11.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
	<p>The <em>Deploy with Workers</em> button will redirect you to a page where you can authorize GitHub to deploy a fork of the repository using GitHub actions while opening with StackBlitz creates a new fork of the template for you to start working with.</p>

	<p>These templates also comes bundled with additional features I would like to share with you:</p>
	<h3 id="integrated-deploy-with-workers-button">Integrated <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/deploy-button/#:~:text=Deploy%20buttons%20let%20you%20deploy,make%20sharing%20your%20work%20easier.">Deploy with Workers</a> Button</h3>
	<p>We added a deploy button to all templates listed in the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/templates">templates repository</a> and the <a href="https://workers.new/templates">collection website</a>, so you can quickly get up to speed with your code. The deploy with Workers button lets you deploy your code in under five minutes, it uses a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-cloudflare-workers-with-wrangler">GitHub action</a> powered with Cloudflare Workers to do this.</p>

	<h3 id="support-for-test-driven-development">Support for Test Driven Development</h3>
	<p>As developers, we need to write tests for our code to ensure weâ€™re shipping quality production grade software and also ensure that our code is bug-free. We support writing tests in Workers using the Wrangler <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api"><em>unstable_dev</em></a> API to write integration and end-to-end tests. We want to enable not just the developer experience but also nudge developers to follow best practices and prioritize TDD in development. We configured a number of templates to support integration tests against a local server, this will serve as a template to help you set up tests in your projects.</p>
	<p>Hereâ€™s an example using Wranglerâ€™s <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#unstable_dev">unstable_dev</a> API and <a href="https://vitest.dev">Vitest</a> test framework to test the code written in an example â€˜Hello workerâ€™ starter template:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
	<pre><code>import { unstable_dev } from 'wrangler';
import { describe, expect, it, beforeAll, afterAll } from 'vitest';

describe('Worker', () =&gt; {
 let worker;

 beforeAll(async () =&gt; {
   worker = await unstable_dev('index.js', {}, { disableExperimentalWarning: true });
 });

 afterAll(async () =&gt; {
   await worker.stop();
 });

 it('should return Hello worker!', async () =&gt; {
   const resp = await worker.fetch();
   if (resp) {
     const text = await resp.text();
     expect(text).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`"Hello worker!"`);
   }
 });
});
</code></pre>

	<h3 id="online-ide-integration-with-stackblitz">Online IDE Integration with StackBlitz</h3>
	<p>We announced <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-stackblitz-partnership">StackBlitzâ€™s partnership with Cloudflare Workers</a> during Platform Week early this year. We believe a developerâ€™s experience should be of utmost priority because we want them to build with ease on our developer platform.</p>
	<p>StackBlitz is an online development platform for building web applications. It is powered by <a href="https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers">WebContainers</a>, the first WebAssembly-based operating system which boots Node.js environments in milliseconds, securely within your browser tab.</p>
	<p>We made it even easier to get started with Workers with an integrated <em><strong>Open with StackBlitz </strong></em>button for each starter template, making it easier to create a fork of a template and the great thing is you only need a web browser to build your application.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
