The WSJ received more than 600 entries from companies in 31 countries around the world. Here's the blurb about CloudFlare that will appear in tomorrow's edition of the WSJ:<br><br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Network and Internet Technologies</strong><br>\nCloudFlare Inc. of San Francisco earned top honors in this category with a service that helps secure and speed up the performance of websites.</em></p>\n<p><em>CloudFlare sits between a website's hosting service and a visitor's computer, sending traffic through its own network of data centers around the globe. Its security feature automatically detects threats from excessive spam, surveillance from malicious programs known as &quot;bots&quot; and denial-of-service attacks; all sites that use CloudFlare are then protected if the threat reappears.</em></p>\n<p><em>Threat-detection systems can slow down Internet page loading because they add an extra layer between a website and its visitors. CloudFlare's developers, however, refined the code running its systems so that most pages load as much as 40% faster.</em></p>\n<p><em>The LulzSec hacker group, which used CloudFlare's service to protect a website where it boasted of its exploits, praised CloudFlare after the service successfully fended off a barrage of attacks designed to bring down the site.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br><br><br>\nYou can read the full story about the award and other winners on <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203633104576623261551755704.html\">the WSJ's website</a>.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
