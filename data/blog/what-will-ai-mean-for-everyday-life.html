	JT: Our focus today is really what does AI mean for everyday life. Iâ€™m hearing a lot about AI. What is your assessment about where we are and how it is making a difference?
	<p>WT: weâ€™re in an unprecedented, interesting era. From a consumer perspective, negative connotation.<br>
		Itâ€™s an interesting era we are in; these technologies are going to do a tremendous amount in terms of consumers selecting what they buy, Helping patient-centric care.</p>
	<p>Combination of data set &amp; availability of resources is fueling AI.</p>
	<p>You might hear 90% of the worldâ€™s data has been created in the past two years. AI will help us deal with that kind of information overload.</p>
	<p>The big difference with programming systems is that AI knows how to understand, reason, learn, interact.</p>
	<p>AG: There is a set of techniques through which we can more accurately predict fraud, insurance plans, credit scoring.</p>
	<p>This is a jump in the past 15 years.</p>
	<p>5 years ago, the ability to do very exciting things with unstructured data, i.e. automating radiology. Then digital networks came along and then we had use case after use case.</p>
	<p>AI has lots of programmatic uses.</p>
	<p>WT: Algorithms are contributing to oncology.</p>
	<p>You take a look at things weâ€™ve done in oncology as an example: the ability to train a system;</p>
	<p>Effect is based on training sets that AI is being fed. Are we using the right humans to train these systems?<br>
		We need to hold the systems to the same standards we hold humans.</p>
	<p>Design principle: Itâ€™s always assisted. Not replacement.</p>
	<p>JT: Do you feel that the future is assisted?</p>
	<p>AG: I donâ€™t necessarily agree that future is assisted. Repetitive tasks can be automated, e.g. radiology. End result is that algorithms are out for anything that involves repetition or mundane tasks.</p>
	<p>Humans spend a lot of time doing repetitive things. I think algorithms will be our future radiologists. Any job that demands a lot of repetition, for instance, auditing, mundane legal tasks.</p>
	<p>There is probably an element of combination between routine algorithm and more challenging cases for humans</p>
	<p>Eventually the algorithm will do the routine, simple tasks, and the more challenging tasks will be given to humans.</p>
	<p>WT: I agree. â€œWeâ€™re getting humans to raise their gameâ€. The idea is to get rid of commodity tasks. When I call Comcast, I go through the same questions all over again. So how do you reduce the time from 1 1/2 days to five minutes? How do we get humans to find solutions to more complex problems?</p>
	<p>Even in a scenario in which AI is playing a game, AI takes care of the commodity moves, and the final win from the human.<br>
		Creativity comes from humans vs. commodity</p>
	<p>JT: Great leap forward is to process unstructured data and give insights; Give insights to someone who may only see a small sliver.</p>
	<p>WT: Especially important in life-sciences;<br>
		They are unstructured data: handwritten reports, etc.</p>
	<p>10k new articles on clinical trials</p>
	<p>AG: Lets say radiologists can look at 3,000 images a year; AI can look at 3,000 a second.<br>
		As long as task is suitable, AI can achieve objective.</p>
	<p>Machines have an unfair advantage.</p>
	<p>JT: what should we be doing as a community to realize potential benefits of AI in everyday life?</p>
	<p>AG: Iâ€™m at Google and I think Google does this effectively: when we use the voice assistant or photos we search for our photos by â€œsearch my nameâ€ and it finds pictures of me. Thatâ€™s the Google brain team going out and infusing products with digital awareness.</p>
	<p>There is a shift that companies should make: being willing to shift to need a handful of outstanding machine learners rather than many; think the right way about talent - small, extremely talented teams.</p>
	<p>WT: The developer is this eraâ€™s doctor/engineer.</p>
	<p>Dominantly, data and application team now work collaboratively. More need for data science.</p>
	<p>The data team and application team used to work separately; now thereâ€™s more need for data scientists and the collaboration of those teams. Data is the fuel for AI; so thatâ€™s an important dynamic to think about.</p>
	<p>Those roles didnâ€™t exist until recently. As we go into next phase, new roles and division of labor will come up.</p>
	<p>Building a team with tremendous expertise is necessary.</p>
	<p>JT: Looking forward, how far should we and can we be taking AI?</p>
	<p>AG: â€œThe future is already here; itâ€™s just not widely distributedâ€<br>
		Challenges are mainly organizational.<br>
		Google brain is an example of how you productionize machine learning in a company.</p>
	<p>Also, reinforcement learning: There is a technique now that automates trial and error; it plays enough games that it learns what gets it a good score.</p>
	<p>Weâ€™re starting to see AI as input to stock trading, ad targeting, etc.<br>
		Generative models are a new area of machine learning: theyâ€™ll take an image and be able to write a caption for that image. Visually impaired people can now describe scenes using AI.</p>
	<p>Digital networks are starting to make their way into existing use cases.</p>
	<p>WT: There is no reason to believe that something like tax codes canâ€™t be replaced by AI. In the future, systems will have embedded AI; Internet can provide access to these systems at a commodity level.</p>
	<p>JT: Youâ€™ve talked about replacing commodity activities, used more broadly. I think about the development of trust that it will take for these technologies to become widespread. Iâ€™m skeptical.</p>
	<p>JT: how can we develop trust ? How should we think about building trust for broader adoption?</p>
	<p>AG: Thereâ€™s the issue of the market being ready. Do i trust my cancer diagnosis from a machine? Building trust is case specific.</p>
	<p>Letâ€™s use radiology: You can start by having a machine operate alongside a human; look at the agreement rates. With medical diagnosis you eventually know for sure. So over time, articles are published, the machine as a track record. If itâ€™s high-performing, maybe it takes over. There is no general answer; very use-case specific.</p>
	<p>WT: Agree. I think you have to build these on some principles, ie transparency. As a consumer you want to know if you are dealing with a human or a system. If a system, who taught it? And when it generates a recommendation, you want to know the data set that recommendation was generated from. Human-assisted is important; will yield the type of system people can trust.</p>
	<p>JT: Also, no human is perfect; so what are our expectations of the system vs. the human?</p>
	<p>AG: â€œAnd no algorithm is perfect.â€ The Tesla will have an accident, just as humans do. The question is: Does the Tesla have accidents at a lower rate than humans? You can be sure that when a non-human has an accident, weâ€™ll view it differently.</p>
	<p><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
	<p>Q: Iâ€™m a physician at Stanford. Doctors spend only 30% of our time taking care of patients, 70% on data. Are we developing AI at the expense of human intelligence?</p>
	<p>WT: not at the expense---how is AI giving you more time to actually make you more efficient and give you data to better make decisions? Data-entry will be taken<br>
		In some cases, weâ€™re giving you more leverage in terms of your data set and efficiency. You wonâ€™t have to key in data; it will be learned / read / listened to by a machine.</p>
	<p>AG: Future lives will be more interesting when you take mundane, repetitive tasks away.</p>
	<p>Letâ€™s say a our mundane roles go away; does that mean fewer of us are needed? Historically weâ€™ve gone through waves of automation and more professions are created. Itâ€™s hard to know in this case; is the disruption happening too quickly to adapt? Itâ€™s a little scary. If the structure does change, I think all our lives will be more interesting minus the mundane tasks.</p>
	<p>Q: I have a 20-year old daughter in college. With so many jobs potentially being replaced, what career advice do you have for her?</p>
	<p>AG: Computer programming and machine learning are good bets.<br>
		If the job involves creativity, and connecting dots in disparate ways, no machine learning technique can replace that even remotely. I donâ€™t know any machine learning techniques capable of doing that.</p>
	<p>WT: In the major revolutions, thereâ€™s always been the fear that occupations will be replaced.<br>
		Weâ€™re in the same era.</p>
	<p>Q: Use-cases have been scientific and medical; what about social and political limitations of AI implementations? E.g. Law that involves rules that are like algorithms: would you be willing to replace jury trials with AI, why or why not?</p>
	<p>AG: At low levels of the legal system, yes; itâ€™s only once you get to the Supreme Court that those should still be conducted by humans. But there are so many rote cases that come to court again and again; so it seems feasible.<br>
		Rote cases could very well be replaced by AI.</p>
	<p>WT: Reasoning is still important. You may have data sets that assist the jury to help them make a better decision; but you canâ€™t replace the human factor on the judgment call.</p>
