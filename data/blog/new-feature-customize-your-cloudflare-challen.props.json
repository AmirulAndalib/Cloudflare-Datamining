Often these requests are from automated bots crawling your website looking for a vulnerability. Sometimes, the threat is a web surfer whose computer has been compromised with a virus or malware and the web surfer is unknowingly spreading viruses online. In these situations, the web surfer visiting a CloudFlare protected website is presented with a challenge page asking them to enter a CAPTCHA to prove they are human.</p>\n<p>The challenge page also educates the visitor that their computer may be<br>\ninfected. This helps to clean up the number of infected computers<br>\nonline, ultimately making the web a better place.</p>\n<p>Today, we are pleased to announce that we have added customization to<br>\nthe challenge page for each domain you have on CloudFlare. Website<br>\nowners can now customize:<br>\n• The colors on the page to match their website<br>\n• The text that is displayed on the page</p>\n<h4 id=\"howtogettotheoptiontocustomizeyourchallengepage\">How to get to the option to customize your challenge page:</h4>\n<p>Settings-&gt;CloudFlare Settings-&gt; Customize</p></p>\n<h3 id=\"makingchangestocolor\">Making changes to color:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/damonbillian/5325456414/\" title=\"Screen shot 2011-01-04 at 3.40.46 PM by dbillian, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Screen shot 2011-01-04 at 3.40.46 PM\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5208/5325456414_d3bf65a9b8.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"Screen shot 2011-01-04 at 3.40.46 PM\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5208/5325456414_d3bf65a9b8.jpg\"></noscript></a></p>\n<p>There are 5 color boxes.

If you need to make changes to the challenge page in the future, simply go back to the 'Customize' option in CloudFlare settings.
