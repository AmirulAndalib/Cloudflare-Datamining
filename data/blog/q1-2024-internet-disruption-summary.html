	<p>Cloudflare’s network spans more than 310 cities in over 120 countries, where we interconnect with over 13,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions. Thanks to recently released Cloudflare Radar <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/glossary/#bgp-announcements">functionality</a>, this quarter we have started to explore the impact from a routing perspective, as well as a traffic perspective, at both a <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1768654743742579059">network</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1773704264650543416">location</a> level.</p>
	<p>The first quarter of 2024 kicked off with quite a few Internet disruptions. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#cablecuts">Damage to both terrestrial and submarine cables</a> caused problems in a number of locations, while <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#militaryaction">military action</a> related to ongoing geopolitical conflicts impacted connectivity in other areas. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#governmentdirected">Governments</a> in several African countries, as well as Pakistan, ordered Internet shutdowns, focusing heavily on mobile connectivity.

	<h3 id="moov-africa-tchad">Moov Africa Tchad</h3>
	<p>Reported fiber optic cable damage that occurred in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/cm">Cameroon</a> on January 10 further disrupted connectivity for customers of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as327802">AS327802 (Moov Africa Tchad / Millicom)</a> a telecommunications provider in Chad. According to a (translated) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moovafrica.td/posts/pfbid0kB9W5CkhVJqBq34agPWqG81yeCfLBijKYc6WiLDKLE79nPmhie4T9idZVStc8f6Xl">Facebook post from Moov Africa Tchad</a>, “<em>On the afternoon of January 10, 2024, there was a breakdown of the internet due to a cut in the optical fiber coming from Cameroon through which Chad has access to the internet, the one coming from Sudan being unavailable for a while.</em>” It is unclear whether the referenced cable cut occurred in Cameroon or Chad, and the mentioned <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd">Sudan</a> cable issue may be <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q4-2023-internet-disruption-summary#:~:text=of%20Internet%20service.-,Chad,-On">the one covered in our Q4 2023 summary post</a>. As a landlocked country, Chad is dependent on terrestrial Internet connections to/through neighboring countries, and the <a href="https://afterfibre.nsrc.org">AfTerFibre cable map</a> illustrates Chad’s reliance on limited cable paths through Cameroon and Sudan.</p>
	<p>The graphs below show that Moov Africa Tchad traffic was disrupted for over 12 hours starting midday (UTC) on January 10, and the disruption was visible at a country level as well. The fiber cut also resulted in significant volatility from a routing perspective, as the volume of announced IPv4 address space shifted frequently at a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as327802?dateStart=2024-01-10&amp;dateEnd=2024-01-11">network</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/td?dateStart=2024-01-10&amp;dateEnd=2024-01-11">country</a> level during the disruption.</p>
	<p>A second less severe disruption was also observed during the morning (UTC) of January 11.

The incident took the network completely offline, as the ASN’s amount of announced IPv4 address space <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as37577?dateStart=2024-02-15&amp;dateEnd=2024-02-15">dropped to zero</a> for the duration.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-02-15&amp;dateEnd=2024-02-15&amp;location=as37577&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/BgpRoutesTimeseriesXY?dateStart=2024-02-15&amp;dateEnd=2024-02-15&amp;location=as37577&amp;chartState=%7B%22bgpSignalsMinMax%22%3Atrue%2C%22bgpSignalsIpVersionParam%22%3A%22ipv4%22%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Announced IP Address Space" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

	<p>A 16-hour Internet disruption on March 2/3 at <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as27653">AS27653 (Digicel Haiti)</a> was due to a double fiber cut <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/haitian-police-unions-plead-help-after-attack-main-prison-2024-03-03">as a result of violence</a> related to attempts to oust Prime Minister Ariel Henry.

The disruption at MTN Sudan aligns with a <a href="https://twitter.com/MTNSudan1/status/1753528636949274956">social media post</a> from the provider, in which they stated (translated) “<em>We regret the interruption of all services due to circumstances beyond our control. While we apologize for the inconvenience caused by this interruption, we assure you of our endeavor to restore the service as soon as possible, and you will be notified of the return of the service.</em>” On February 5, several days after their outage started, Zain Sudan published a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZainSudan/status/1754487740102533170">social media post</a> that stated (translated) “<em>Zain Sudan has been constantly striving to maintain communication and Internet service to serve its valued subscribers, and we would like to point out that the current network outage is due to circumstances beyond its control, with our hopes that safety will prevail, and that service will be restored as soon as possible.</em>” Sudatel did not share any information about the status of its network. On February 4, Digital Rights Lab - Sudan <a href="https://twitter.com/drlab_sudan/status/1754134933772128326">posted on social media</a> that “<em>Our sources confirmed that </em><a href="https://twitter.com/RSFSudan"><em>@RSFSudan</em></a><em> forces tookover data centers of ISPs in Khartoum, #Sudan.</em>” It is likely that the Internet outages observed across these providers are related to these takeovers, part of the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/power-struggle-sudan">military conflict that has been underway in the country</a> since April 15, 2023.</p>
	<p>The disruptions on these networks varied in length. At Sudatel, traffic started to return on February 11. At Zain Sudan, traffic began to return on March 3, corroborated by a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZainSudan/status/1764217865530376300">social media post</a> that stated (translated) “<em>Zain network is gradually returning to work and allows its subscribers to communicate for free for a limited time. Zain promises to continue working to restore its network in the rest of the states.</em>” Traffic had not yet returned on MTN Sudan by the end of the first quarter.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-02-01&amp;dateEnd=2024-03-01&amp;location=as15706&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-02-01&amp;dateEnd=2024-03-31&amp;location=as36972&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-02-01&amp;dateEnd=2024-03-05&amp;location=as36998&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
	<h3 id="ukraine">Ukraine</h3>
	<p>In February, the Ukraine/Russia war reached the two-year mark, and over that time, we have covered a number of Internet outages in Ukraine caused by conflict-related attacks. On February 22, <a href="https://therecord.media/massive-missile-russian-barrage-internet-outages-blackouts">Russian air strikes on critical infrastructure in Ukraine</a> damaged energy facilities across the country, resulting in widespread power outages. These power outages caused Internet disruptions across multiple regions in Ukraine, including Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odessa, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and Khmelnytskyi Oblast. Traffic initially dropped around 05:00 local time (03:00 UTC), falling as much as 68% in Kharkiv. However, all regions saw lower traffic levels for several days as compared to the week before.</p>

	<p>In our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q4-2023-internet-disruption-summary"><em>Q4 2023 Internet disruption summary</em></a> blog post, we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q4-2023-internet-disruption-summary#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20outages%20illustrated%20above">noted that</a> throughout October, November, and December, <a href="https://paltel.ps/en/home">Paltel (Palestine Telecommunications Company)</a> had published several social media posts about disruptions to its landline, mobile, and Internet services. During the first quarter of 2024, similar outages were observed on <a href="https://twitter.com/Paltelco/status/1745813735627727091">January 12</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Paltelco/status/1749464176756449631">January 22</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1765100306353017128">March 5</a>. Paltel attributes these outages to the ongoing aggression related to the war with Israel.</p>
	<p>The associated outages during the quarter varied in length, from just a few hours to over a week. Each outage is shown in the graphs below, which show Paltel traffic within four Palestinian governorates in the Gaza Strip region. While it appears that the Gaza governorate suffered a disruption to traffic as connectivity remained available, complete outages occurred in the Khan Yunis, Rafah, and Deir al-Balah governorates.</p>

	<p>Network <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing">routing</a> is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks, and on the Internet, routing relies on the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp">Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</a>. Historically, the exchange of BGP routing information was based on trust between providers, but over time, security mechanisms such as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki">Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</a> have been developed to prevent abuse of the system by bad actors. RPKI is a cryptographic method of signing records that associate a BGP route announcement with the correct originating AS number. ROA (Route Origin Authorization) records provide a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has authorized an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system">AS (Autonomous System)</a> to originate routes to that one or more prefixes within the address block. Cloudflare has <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/rpki">published a number of blog posts</a> over the years about the importance of, and our support for, RPKI. Properly implemented and configured, RPKI and ROAs help support routing security, effectively preventing behavior like <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/bgp-hijacking">BGP hijacking</a>.</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://www.ripe.net">RIPE NCC</a> (“RIPE”) is one of five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry">Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)</a> that provides Internet resource allocation and registration, and coordination activities. RIPE’s region covers Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. On January 3, a malicious actor took advantage of lax account security on the part of RIPE and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as12479">AS12479 (Orange España)</a> and <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/rpki-signed-but-not-secure">used credentials found on the public Internet</a> to log into Orange España’s RIPE account. Once in control of the account, the attacker published multiple ROAs with “bogus” origins, rendering thousands of routes originated by AS12479 “RPKI-invalid”, which <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/digging-into-the-orange-espana-hack">resulted in carriers that reject RPKI-invalid routes to stop carrying a large amount of Orange España’s IP space</a>.</p>
	<p>Because Cloudflare enforces RPKI validation, we also rejected the RPKI-invalid routes. We would have started trying to reach Orange España over our default route toward some of our transit providers, but because they also perform RPKI validation, traffic would have been dropped within those provider networks as well. Because of this, from Cloudflare’s perspective, this incident caused a drop in traffic from Orange España between 16:45 and 19:45 local time (14:45 - 17:45 UTC) as well as a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as12479?dateStart=2024-01-03&amp;dateEnd=2024-01-03">notable drop in announced IPv4 address space from AS12479</a>.</p>

However, the underlying cause of the disruption turned out to be significantly less sensational – it was apparently<a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2024/01/broadband-isp-plusnet-recovers-from-dns-linked-mass-outage.html"> linked to problems with their DNS servers</a>. Because subscribers were unable to successfully resolve hostnames using Plusnet’s default DNS resolvers, this ultimately manifested itself as a drop in traffic from the network for approximately two hours, between 16:00 and 18:00 local time (and UTC). Users that had configured their systems to use a third-party DNS resolver, such as <a href="https://one.one.one.one/dns">Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 service</a>, did not experience a service disruption.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-01-15&amp;dateEnd=2024-01-15&amp;location=as6871&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

	<p>DNS issues also impacted users in Russia during January, though in a different way than Plusnet subscribers in the UK experienced. A <a href="https://circleid.com/posts/20240130-dnssec-failure-causes-massive-website-outages-on-russian-internet">reported</a> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works">DNSSEC</a> failure on January 30 resulted in .ru domains becoming inaccessible for several hours. (DNSSEC creates a secure domain name system by adding cryptographic signatures to existing DNS records. By checking its associated signature, you can verify that a requested DNS record comes from its authoritative name server and wasn’t altered en-route, as opposed to a fake record injected in a man-in-the-middle attack.)</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8914#name-extended-dns-error-code-6-d">DNSSEC validation failure</a> resulted in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unwrap-the-servfail">SERVFAIL</a> responses to DNS lookups against Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 resolver for hostnames in the .ru country code top level domain (ccTLD). At peak, 68.4% of requests received SERVFAIL responses. The Coordination Center for the .ru ccTLD <a href="https://t.me/fontankaspb/51445">confirmed</a> that it was working on the “technical problem affecting the .ru zone associated with the global DNSSEC infrastructure” but didn’t provide any additional details around the root cause of the problem, such as a potential issue with a DNSSEC key rollover. The .ru ccTLD experienced a <a href="https://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages/20190816-ru">similar DNSSEC-related outage</a> for several hours on August 16, 2019, as well.</p>

	<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Two notable submarine cable damage events during the first quarter again highlighted the importance of protecting submarine cables, and the risks associated with them passing through/near geopolitically sensitive areas. Given the <a href="https://blog.telegeography.com/2023-mythbusting-part-3">reliance on submarine cables for carrying Internet traffic</a>, this will continue to be an issue for many years to come.</p>
	<p>The Orange España incident also shed light on the importance of securing operationally important resources with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>, a topic that Cloudflare has <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust">written about in the past</a>. Organizations like RIPE play a critically important behind-the-scenes role in functioning of the Internet, arguably obligating them to take all practical precautions when it comes to securing their systems in order to prevent malicious actors from taking actions that could broadly disrupt Internet connectivity.</p>
