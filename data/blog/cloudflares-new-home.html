	<p>Cloudflare opened its first office today in downtown Palo Alto, CA. Ourteam has grown from 3 people to five and we are excited to have Matthieuand Ian onboard. Matthieu and Ian are engineers that will help makeCloudflare awesome for its users.</p>
	<p>Our new office space is really cool. It has a startup feel with an openarea where we all work, break-out rooms when we need to work in smallergroups and a perfect place to hang our sign outside. And, as an addedbonus, we have a patio that gets lots of sunshine during the day. Thenext purchase: A BBQ!</p>
