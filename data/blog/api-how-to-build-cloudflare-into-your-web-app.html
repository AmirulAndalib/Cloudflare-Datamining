	<p>We're happy to release today a couple APIs that allow web developers to
		integrate CloudFlare directly into their web applications.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html">CloudFlare DNS / Threat Control
			API</a>
		<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html">CloudFlare Settings
			API</a>
	</p>
	<p>If you're a web developer, what could you do with these APIs? Well, you
		could....</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Add a button to Joomla's control panel to automatically clear your
			CloudFlare cache</li>
		<li>Create a WordPress plugin that allows you to change your security
			level right from the control panel</li>
		<li>Automatically add the IPs of visitors you report as spam in Drupal
			to your CloudFlare Threat Control block list</li>
		<li>Update your DNS records hosted in CloudFlare from your custom cPanel
			module</li>
		<li>Report your unique visitor stats from within your vBulletin board</li>
		<li>And much more!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These APIs join the existing CloudFlare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/host-api.html">Hosting Provider
			API</a>, which allows hosting
		providers to offer CloudFlare to their users without giving up control
		of [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/). While the Hosting Provider API is limited to approved hosts, the
		new APIs are open to anyone with a CloudFlare account.</p>
	<p>We're excited to see how web developers will integrate with the news
		APIs, and we're committed to exposing more functionality over time so
		<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/contact.html">let us know</a> what you'd like
		to see. Finally don't forget to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/contact.html">tell
			us</a> if you build a plugin or
		other functionality with the CloudFlare API so we can promote your work
		to the whole CloudFlare community!
	</p>
