	<p>We're happy to release today a couple APIs that allow web developers to integrate CloudFlare directly into their web applications.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html">CloudFlare DNS / Threat Control API</a> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html">CloudFlare Settings API</a></p>
	<p>If you're a web developer, what could you do with these APIs? Well, you could....</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Add a button to Joomla's control panel to automatically clear your CloudFlare cache</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Create a WordPress plugin that allows you to change your security level right from the control panel</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Automatically add the IPs of visitors you report as spam in Drupal to your CloudFlare Threat Control block list</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Update your DNS records hosted in CloudFlare from your custom cPanel module</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Report your unique visitor stats from within your vBulletin board</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>And much more!</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These APIs join the existing CloudFlare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/host-api.html">Hosting Provider API</a>, which allows hosting providers to offer CloudFlare to their users without giving up control of [DNS](<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns">https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/</a>). While the Hosting Provider API is limited to approved hosts, the new APIs are open to anyone with a CloudFlare account.</p>
	<p>We're excited to see how web developers will integrate with the news APIs, and we're committed to exposing more functionality over time so <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/contact.html">let us know</a> what you'd like to see. Finally don't forget to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/contact.html">tell us</a> if you build a plugin or other functionality with the CloudFlare API so we can promote your work to the whole CloudFlare community!</p>
