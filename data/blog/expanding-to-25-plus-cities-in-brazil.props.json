This is one of the largest simultaneous single-country expansions we’ve done so far.</p><p>With this partnership, Brazilians throughout the country will see significant improvement to their Internet experience. Already, the 25th-percentile latency of non-bot traffic (we use that measure as an approximation of physical distance from our servers to end users) has dropped from the mid-20 millisecond range to sub-10 milliseconds. This benefit extends not only to the 25 million Internet properties on our network, but to the entire Internet with Cloudflare services like <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/\">1.1.1.1</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/\">WARP</a>. We expect that as we approach 25 cities in Brazil, latency will continue to drop while throughput increases.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/07/image1-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A graph showing a decline in RTT from the 23-millisecond range to the 5-millsecond range.\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>25th percentile latency of non-bot traffic in Brazil has more than halved as new cities have gone live.</em></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/07/most-recent-brazil--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A map of Cloudflare's Brazil presences, present and future.\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>This partnership is part of our mission to help create a better Internet and the best development experience for all — not just those in major population centers or in Western markets — and we are excited to take this step on our journey to help build a better Internet. Whether you live in the heart of São Paulo or the outskirts of the Amazon rainforest in Manaus, expect an upgrade to your Internet experience soon.</p><p>We have already launched in <strong>Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Campinas, Curitiba, </strong>and <strong>Fortaleza</strong>, with additional presences coming soon to <strong>Manaus, São Paulo, Blumenau, Joinville, Florianópolis, Itajai, Belém, Goiânia, Salvador, São José do Rio Preto</strong>, <strong>Americana</strong>, and <strong>Sorocaba</strong>.</p><p>From there, we’re planning on adding presences in the following cities: <strong>Guarulhos, Mogi das Cruzes, São José dos Campos, Vitória, Londrina, Maringá, Campina Grande, Caxias do Sul, Cuiabá, Lajeado, Natal, Recife, Osasco, Santo André</strong>, and <strong>Rio</strong>. The result will be a net expansion of Cloudflare in Brazil by <em>12 to 16 times</em>.</p><p>We celebrate the benefits that this partnership will bring to Latin America. Our President and Chief Operating Officer Michelle Zatlyn likes to say that “<em>we’re just getting started</em>”. In that spirit, expect more exciting news about the Cloudflare network not only in Latin America, but worldwide!</p><p><em>Do you work at an ISP who is interested in bringing a better Internet experience to your users and better control over your network?
