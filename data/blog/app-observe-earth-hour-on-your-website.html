	<h3 id="itwouldbegreatif">"It would be great if..."</h3>
	<p>This app started with a casual request on Tuesday, March 27th, in a public CloudFlare support thread.<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>I think it would be great if CloudFlare had an app to aid in Earth Hour this upcoming Saturday, March 31 @ 8:30 PM. It's not too late to join in on the effort!</p>
	</blockquote>
	<br>
	Time was too short for CloudFlare to help, based on other projects. But — just in case — I mentioned the alpha version of our developer platform. <a href="https://twitter.com/C19H34O2?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Katie G.</a>, a developer in the UK, warned that she was busy with lots of work and other projects, but ended with:<br><br>
	<blockquote>
		<p>I'll still try to do it though in time for Earth Hour.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Last night — about 48 hours later — <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/earthhour?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Earth Hour</a> was made available to all CloudFlare customers as a free CloudFlare app!</p>
	<p>Turn on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/earthhour?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">the app</a>, and for one hour on March 31 (today, for some; tomorrow for many) your site will go dark and present a message to the site visitor explaining <a href="http://www.earthhour.org/?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Earth Hour</a>. The app offers site owners the chance to "Save the world, 60 minutes every 365 days at a time."</p>
	<p>We applaud Katie for her quick work, and her questions during development have helped us improve the platform already.</p>
