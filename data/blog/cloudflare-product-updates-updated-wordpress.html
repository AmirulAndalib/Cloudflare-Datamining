	<p>As you may have noticed recently, our engineers have been releasing a bunch of new products over the past few weeks. In addition to a vastly improved and cheaper option for adding <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/easiest-ssl-ever-now-included-automatically-w">CloudFlare SSL</a> to domains, we've also made a few changes that may have been missed with the SSL changes.</p>
	<h3>What's new:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>CloudFlare has updated the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cloudflare">CloudFlare WordPress plugin</a> to reflect new IP addresses we've added to the CloudFlare network. We're waiting on approval to get the new IP addresses updated in the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-joomla-extension">CloudFlare Joomla extension</a> as well.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>CloudFlare added some new <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips">CloudFlare IP address</a> ranges for both IpV4 and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa">IpV6</a>. Customers should make sure that they have <a href="https://cloudflare.tenderapp.com/kb/troubleshooting/how-do-i-update-mod_cloudflare">updated mod_cloudflare</a> to reflect these changes.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>CloudFlare has recently launched a much improved version of CloudFlare invoices that you can find in your <a href="https://cloudflare.tenderapp.com/kb/pro-accounts/where-can-i-find-my-billing-history">billing history</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>CloudFlare's SSL now has <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22046881-What-do-the-three-SSL-options-off-Flexible-Full-mean-">three different SSL setting options</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A new CloudFlare datacenter in the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/groovy-baby-cloudflares-london-data-center-no">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/dome9">Dome9</a> has been added to our growing list of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps">app partners</a>.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>What's around the corner:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>A new look to the overview page for 'My Websites'.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A new look to the CloudFlare 'Settings' page.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A new tier of billing service (stay tuned).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
