	<p>Elya is incredibly focused on initiatives to improve their customer's experiences.</p>
	<p>"One of our initiatives I would definitely like to point out is our customer onboarding process," said Elya. "It's a three-stage process, we onboard the customers as soon as the order is submitted. Within 10 minutes a call is being placed to welcome them aboard."</p>
	<p>Two more calls are placed within the next week, just to be sure customers are having a painless, easy onboarding experience.</p>
	<p>At HostingCon, Elya was excited to meet with companies to partner with.</p>
	<p>"We are looking for partnerships to enhance the customer experience," said Elya.</p>
	<p>When it comes to dealing with the customers directly, Elya welcomes to opportunity and even gets to practice her Russian.</p>
	<p>"I think the executive team has to be involved and connect with the customer base," said Elya.</p>
