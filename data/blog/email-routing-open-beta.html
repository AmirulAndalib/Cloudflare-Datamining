	<p>I won’t beat around the bush: we’ve moved <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-email-routing/">Cloudflare Email Routing</a> from closed beta to open beta ? </p>
	<p>What does this mean? It means that there’s no waitlist anymore; every zone* in every Cloudflare account has Email Routing available to them.</p>
	<p>To get started just open one of the zones in your <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=%2F%3Aaccount%2F%3Azone%2Femail%2Foverview" target="_blank">Cloudflare Dashboard</a> and click on <em>Email</em> in the navigation pane.</p>

	<h3 id="our-journey-so-far">Our journey so far</h3>
	<p>Back in September 2021, during Cloudflare’s Birthday Week, we <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-email-routing/">introduced</a> Email Routing as the simplest solution for creating custom email addresses for your domains without the hassle of managing multiple mailboxes.</p>
	<p>Many of us at Cloudflare saw a need for this type of product, and we’ve been using it since before it had a UI. After Birthday Week, we started gradually opening it to Cloudflare customers that requested access through the wait list; starting with just a few users per week and gradually ramping up access as we found and fixed edge cases.</p>
	<p>Most recently, with users wanting to set up Email Routing for more of their domains and with some of <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2855120" target="_blank">G Suite legacy</a> users looking for an alternative to starting a subscription, we have been onboarding tens of thousands of new zones <em>every day</em> into the closed beta. We’re loving the adoption and the feedback!</p>
	<p>Needless to say that with hundreds of thousands of zones from around the world in the Email Routing beta we uncovered many new use cases and a few limitations, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/known-limitations" target="_blank">a couple of which</a> still exist. But these few months of closed beta gave us the confidence to move to the next stage - open beta - which now makes <strong>Cloudflare Email Routing available to everyone, including free zones</strong>.</p>
	<p>Thank you to all of you that were part of the closed beta and provided feedback. We couldn’t be more excited to welcome everyone else!</p>
