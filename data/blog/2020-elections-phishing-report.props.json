With fewer than 100 days left until Election Day, the report reveals that states are still in widely varying stages of cybersecurity readiness.</p><p>Key findings include:</p><ul><li>The majority (53.24 percent) of state and local election administrators have only <em>rudimentary or non-standard technologies </em>to protect themselves from phishing;</li><li>Fewer than 3 out of 10 (28.14 percent) election administrators have <em>basic </em>controls to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/how-to-prevent-phishing/\">prevent phishing</a>;</li><li>Fewer than 2 out of 10 (18.61 percent) election administrators have implemented <em>advanced anti-phishing </em>cybersecurity controls;</li><li>A surprising 5.42 percent of election administrators rely on <em>personal email accounts</em> or technologies designed for personal email (such as Yahoo!, Hotmail, AOL or others), to conduct their duties; and</li><li>A number of election administrators independently manage their own custom email infrastructure, including using <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/28/2002306626/-1/-1/0/CSA%20Sandworm%20Actors%20Exploiting%20Vulnerability%20in%20Exim%20Transfer%20Agent%2020200528.pdf\">versions of Exim known to be targeted</a> by cyber actors linked to the Russian military that interfered in prior U.S. elections.</li></ul><p>Ninety-five percent of cybersecurity damages worldwide begin with phishing, and phishing campaigns come in all shapes and sizes. The majority of phishing campaigns begin with an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/phishing-the-clintons-1481761502\">innocuous and authentic email</a> that individuals are unable to recognize as malicious. Consequently, the quality of email protection used by organizations and individuals has an inordinate bearing on their overall cybersecurity posture.</p><p>“Our elections are vital. They need to be resilient against whatever crisis the moment throws at us — and that requires resources and planning,” said Oren J. Falkowitz, co-founder of Area 1 Security. “However, most state and local election administrators are not very close to ensuring a safe election. This challenge is going to be exacerbated the longer it takes for them to get the resources and expertise needed to make changes.”</p><p><strong>Area 1’s email security recommendations for state and local election administrators include:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ending use of Exim email servers:</strong> Given the government’s guidance to update Exim to mitigate <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10149\">CVE-2019-10149</a> and other vulnerabilities including, but not limited to, <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15846\">CVE-2019-15846</a> and <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16928\">CVE-2019-16928, </a>election administrators are urged to cease use of Exim. Upgrading alone does not mitigate exploitation. Prior Russian cyber activities directed towards U.S. elections make use of Exim ill-advised. For those who must continue running Exim, update to the latest version; running a version prior to 4.93 leaves a system vulnerable to disclosed vulnerabilities. Administrators can update Exim Mail Transfer Agent software through their Linux distribution’s package manager or by downloading the latest version from <a href=\"https://exim.org/mirrors.html\">https://exim.org/mirrors.html</a>.</li><li><strong>Transitioning to cloud email infrastructure:</strong> Running custom email infrastructure requires network administrators to be perfect every single day. Instead, Area 1 Security recommends the use of cloud email infrastructure such as Google’s GSuite or Microsoft’s Office 365 in combination with a cloud email security solution.</li><li><strong>Ending use of personal email technologies for election duties: </strong>Under no circumstances should election administrators use personal email for the conduct or administration of elections.</li></ul><p><em>Area 1 Security is committed to <strong>Responsible Disclosure</strong> guidelines in all situations where it uncovers specific and verifiable campaign activity. As part of our commitment to those guidelines, Area 1 has been engaged with relevant stakeholders that have an interest in understanding this campaign in greater depth.</em></p>",
