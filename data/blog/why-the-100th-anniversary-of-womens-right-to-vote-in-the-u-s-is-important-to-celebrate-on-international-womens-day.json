	"description": "Yellow roses were worn by supporters of women&#x27;s right to vote during the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement in the early 20th century in the United States. The yellow rose became the symbol of victory in the movement and this week, across all of our offices, we celebrate the achievements of women."
