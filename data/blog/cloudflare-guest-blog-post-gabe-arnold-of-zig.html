	<p>I run a small technology firm and write on my blog <a href="http://gabearnold.com">GabeArnold.com</a> I focus on techniques and technology that help small business owners grow and succeed in a rapid and measurable manner. CloudFlare meets my criteria as a reliable tool for small business owners and freelancers.</p>
	<h3 id="howdidyouhearaboutcloudflare">How did you hear about CloudFlare?</h3>
	<p>I heard about CloudFlare from my friend <a href="http://www.lanecampbell.com">Lane Campbell</a>. He has been studying CDN's and ways to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/overview.html">improve page load speeds</a> since around the time Google changed to their instant search algorithm.</p>
	<h3 id="whydidyoujoincloudflare">Why did you join CloudFlare?</h3>
	<p>After seeing the page load performance and blocked attacks that Lane showed me from one of the sites he had enrolled I decided to try it after a few weeks. I ended up joining one day because after reviewing what it takes to put a site in CloudFlare it was so simple that it literally took 5 minutes. Basically all a user has to do is <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22047501-What-is-DNS-">change their name server</a> records. I also like knowing that attacks have been blocked from my sites. Using a CMS like <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> for many of my projects presents a general security risk, so having my sites protected at another layer gives me peace of mind.</p>
	<p>One of the other reasons I joined CloudFlare was because I had to find a service that helped me start out my projects on an affordable hosting service and grow from there. CloudFlare has allowed me to use budget hosts while conceptualizing a site or project. CloudFlare's performance boost makes it look like I am running a dedicated server instead of just<br>
		a shared hosting account.</p>
	<h3 id="howmanysiteshaveyouputonthecloudflarenetwork">How many sites have you put on the CloudFlare network?</h3>
	<p>Right now I have 5 sites, and I load all my new project sites into CloudFlare. In most cases even when I have the site under development I will load it into CloudfFlare at the beginning.</p>
	<p>My goal is to put any new sites I run into CloudFlare. For me the process of setting up a new website is a three step process and goes like this:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Buy a domain </li>
		<li>Setup hosting </li>
		<li>Enroll in CloudFlare</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 id="whatsbeenthebiggestsurpriseforyouusingcloudflare">What's been the biggest surprise for you using CloudFlare?</h3>
	<p>Honestly, the ease of enrolling the sites was so much easier than I expected. 99% of the time it will be as simple as typing in your domain name, clicking "Add this website" and then updating your name servers at the domain level. It really takes 5 minutes, and the performance makes all the difference in the world.</p>
	<h3 id="whatsyourfavoritecloudflarefeature">What's your favorite CloudFlare feature?</h3>
	<p>I like the performance boost that my sites get. That is probably the first thing that I realize when enrolling a new site. The other piece that I enjoy is the dashboard that shows stats with blocked attacks and saved bandwidth:</p>

	<h3 id="whatwouldyourecommendthatnewcustomerstocloudflareknow">What would you recommend that new customers to CloudFlare know?</h3>
	<p>There are two things that I think make a big difference when I recommend a new service:</p>
	<p>First - will it be easy?</p>
	<p>The answer with CloudFlare is YES! It's incredibly easy to use. You don't have to be an uber-nerd to handle this one.</p>
	<p>Second, are there any risks?</p>
	<p>No, everything happens seamlessly and there there is no downtime for the site. You can enroll immediately and see results as soon as DNS updates<br>
		across the Internet.</p>
	<p>I personally love using CloudFlare and I would be happy to share my experience or answer any other questions you may have. Just <a href="http://gabearnold.com/contact-me">contact me</a> with any questions you may have.</p>
