	<p>Today, we’re pleased to offer startups up to $250,000 in credits to use on Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products"><u>Developer Platform</u></a>. This new credits system will allow you to clearly see usage and associated fees to plan for a predictable future after the $250,000 in credits have been used up or after one year, whichever happens first.</p>
	<p>You can see eligibility criteria and apply to the start-up program <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/forstartups"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>What can you use the credits for?</h2>
	<p>Credits can be applied to all Developer Platform products, as well as <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-smart-routing"><u>Argo</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/advanced-configuration/cache-reserve"><u>Cache Reserve</u></a>. Moreover, we provide participants with up to three <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans"><u>Enterprise-level domains</u></a>, which includes CDN, DDoS, DNS, WAF, Zero Trust, and other <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products"><u>security and performance products</u></a> that a participant can enable for their website.</p>
	<h3>Developer tools and building on Cloudflare</h3>
	<p>You can use credits for Cloudflare Developer Platform products, including those listed in the table below.</p>

	<h3>Speed and performance with Cloudflare</h3>
	<p>We know that founders need all the help they can get when starting their businesses. Beyond the Developer Platform, you can also use the Startup Program for our speed and performance products. Getting customers where they need to go within <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed"><u>milliseconds</u></a> on your website or application is the difference between closing a sale or not. You can test your speed <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/basic-tasks/test-speed"><u>here</u></a> and learn how to optimize your speed and performance <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/get-started/performance/optimize-speed"><u>here</u></a> with solutions like: <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/images"><u>Images</u></a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-smart-routing"><u>Argo</u></a>, and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/advanced-configuration/early-hints"><u>Early Hints</u></a>.</p>

	<h2>Why does Cloudflare support founders and startups?&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>Founders and developers face enough challenges without having to worry about incurring egregious costs to test technology and start building in the earliest days. You have the world at your fingertips and should be empowered to build and create without limitations. Invest money in your innovation, not in the infrastructure and technology that supports it.</p>
	<p>The Startup Program understands this founder experience deeply, as the team is made up of former founders. Cloudflare is committed to programs like this to empower founders building the <i>next big thing</i>. Offering up to $250,000 in credits will allow folks to leverage even more of what we have to offer: a developer experience that removes friction, saves money, and gets applications spun up in hours, not days.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We want to support founders from everywhere on earth.</p>
	<p>Be bold and keep building! Follow <a href="https://x.com/cloudflaredev"><u>@CloudflareDev</u></a> and join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev"><u>Developer Discord</u></a> server.</p>
