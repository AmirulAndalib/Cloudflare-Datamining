	"description": "In 2009, Google began work on a new network protocol to make web pages faster. Dubbed SPDY (pronounced &quot;speedy&quot;), the protocol is designed to solve many of the bottlenecks that slow HTTP down. Beginning today, we&#x27;re rolling out a beta of SPDY to CloudFlare customers. "
