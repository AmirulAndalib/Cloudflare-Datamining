Having been in the tech industry for almost a decade, Ryan is an experienced professional at both startups and Fortune 500 companies, with an MBA and engineering degrees.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Ryan at HostingCon where we talked about Basekit, where he's seeing growth in the industry, and what their customers are saying.</p>\n<p>&quot;We have a platform for small businesses to get online. At the very basic part of that it is getting a website and getting a template that is relevant to what customers are doing,&quot; said Ryan. &quot;We try to make that as slick and easy as possible.&quot;</p>\n<p>Basekit provides customers with everything they need to create a professional website in an easy to use, completely customisable way. No coding required.</p>\n<p>&quot;The biggest thing, the reason they are picking Basekit, is that there's a ton of flexibility there,&quot; said Ryan.</p>\n<p>Basekit's customers span from photography sites to ecommerce sites to small businesses of all kinds.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's a wild and wooly mix of small businesses out there,&quot; said Ryan.</p>\n<p><em>At HostingCon 2012, <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/\">CloudFlare</a> co-founder <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/zatlyn\">Michelle Zatlyn</a> sat down with 28 leading experts in the hosting industry.
