On Wednesday, May 21, CloudFlare will be hosting GoSFâ€™s Go Session 2 - Programming in Go (for Experienced Devs). Go Sessions are part of a program designed by GoSF members to provide a guided pair-programming experience to increase knowledge of using Go in production. Experienced Go developers will lead coding exercises that will run you through Go compiling, dependency management, program structure, concurrency, and more. Interested in learning more? RSVP on the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/golangsf/events/170422002/\">GoSF meetup page</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the networking and learning these meetups offer, CloudFlare provides pizza and beverages for all attendees. We hope to see some of you at our next event!</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
