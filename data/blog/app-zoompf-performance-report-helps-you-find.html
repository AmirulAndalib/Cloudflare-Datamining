	<h3>Value of the Zoompf Performance Report</h3>
	<p>Zoompf provides a superior performance analysis over free tools in 3 key ways: breadth, depth, and detail.</p>
	<p>First, Zoompf scans large portions of your site, not just a single page. This ensures that all your pages are optimized.</p>
	<p>Next, Zoompf tests for over 100 different performance issues from their comprehensive database of over 400. Free tools test for only a dozen or so issues.</p>
	<p>Finally, while a free tool might provide a sentences or two description about a performance issue, Zoompf provides a wealth of information including a summary, easy-to-fix ratings, and detailed remediation information -- all with accompanying diagrams and code snippets.</p>
	<p>Testing more of your website, for more issues, and providing more information about how to be faster makes Zoompf the best front-end performance analysis tool available today.</p>
	<h3>Results You Can Use</h3>
	<p>Zoompf Performance Report helps you find and fix performance issues to drop seconds off page load times, improve user satisfaction, drive additional revenue, and reduce operational costs. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/zoompf_report">Get your report today!</a></p>
