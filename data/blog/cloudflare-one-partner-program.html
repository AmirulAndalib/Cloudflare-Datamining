	<p>Today marks the launch of the Cloudflare One Partner Program, a program built around our Zero Trust, Network as a Service and Cloud Email Security offerings. The program helps channel partners deliver on the promise of Zero Trust while monetizing this important architecture in tangible ways – with a comprehensive set of solutions, enablement and incentives. We are delighted to have such broad support for the program from IT Service companies, Distributors, Value Added Resellers, Managed Service Providers and other solution providers.</p>
	<p>This represents both a new go-to-market channel for Cloudflare, and a new way for companies of all sizes to adopt Zero Trust solutions that have previously been difficult to procure, implement and support.</p>
	<h3 id="the-cloudflare-one-partner-program-consists-of-the-following-elements-">The Cloudflare One Partner Program consists of the following elements:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>New, fully cloud-native Cloudflare One product suites that help partners streamline and accelerate the design of holistic Zero Trust solutions that are easier to implement. The product suites include our Zero Trust products and Cloud Email Security products from our recent acquisition of Area 1 Security.</li>
		<li>All program elements are fully operationalized through Cloudflare's Distributors to make it easier to evaluate, quote and deliver Cloudflare One solutions in a consistent and predictable way.</li>
		<li>The launch of new Partner Accreditations to enable partners to assess, implement and support Zero Trust solutions for their customers. This includes a robust set of training to help partners deliver the margin-rich services their customers need to realize the full value of their Zero Trust investments.</li>
		<li>One of the most robust partner incentive structures in the industry, rewarding partners for the value they add throughout the entire customer lifecycle.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>"<em>TD Synnex has been working hand-in-hand with Cloudflare on the launch of their new Cloudflare One Partner Program for Zero Trust. This program takes Zero Trust from a term that's broadly and loosely used and cuts through the hype with the solution bundles, enablement resources, and incentives that help the channel deliver true business value</em>", said Tracy Holtz, Vice President, Security and Networking at TD Synnex. "<em>TD Synnex being the world's leading IT distributor and solutions aggregator is thrilled to be furthering our partnership with Cloudflare to build and enable this Program of partners as it is encompassing the solution that all organizations need today.</em>"</p>
	<h3 id="why-is-cloudflare-making-this-investment-in-the-cloudflare-one-partner-program-now">Why is Cloudflare making this investment in the Cloudflare One Partner Program now?</h3>
	<p>The Cloudflare One Partner Program is launching to address the explosive demand to implement <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/" target="_blank">Zero Trust</a> architectures that help organizations of all sizes safely and securely accelerate their digital transformations. In the face of ever-increasing cyber threats, Zero Trust moves from a concept to an imperative. Cloudflare is in a unique position to make this happen to one of the richest Zero Trust product suites in the industry including a Secure Web Gateway, ZTNA Access Management, CASB, Browser Isolation, DLP and Cloud Email Security. These products are tightly integrated and easy-to-use enabling a holistic, implementable solution.</p>
	<p>Additionally, our Zero Trust suite has a comprehensive tech partner ecosystem that makes it easy for our customers to integrate our solutions in their existing tech stack. We integrate and closely partner with industry leaders across all major categories — identity, endpoint detection and response, mobile device management, and email service providers — to make Cloudflare One flexible and robust for our diverse customer base. Our strategic partners include Microsoft, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Mandiant, and others.</p>
	<p>“<em>Enterprises have come to terms with the notion of a disintegrating traditional perimeter. The distributed and dynamic perimeter of today requires a fundamentally new approach to security. In partnership with Cloudflare, our AI-powered cybersecurity platform offers modern organizations a robust Zero Trust security solution that spans devices, network, and mission-critical applications.</em>” said Chuck Fontana, Senior Vice President, Business Development, SentinelOne</p>
	<p>But it takes more than just the products to realize the promise of Zero Trust. It requires the skills and expertise of the channel, as trusted advisors to their customers, to optimize the solutions to drive the specific required business outcomes, or time-to-value for the customer's investment.</p>
	<p><em>“We’ve been humbled by how our existing partners have contributed to the explosive growth of our Zero Trust business, but increased customer demand is creating an opportunity for our partners to play a bigger role in how we go to market. More than ever before we are relying on our partners to help customers evaluate, implement and support Zero Trust solutions”</em>, said Matthew Price, CEO of Cloudflare.</p>
	<p>"<em>By furthering our partnership with Cloudflare in the new Cloudflare One Partner Program, Rackspace Technology is able to deliver Cloudflare's leading Zero Trust solutions paired with Rackspace Elastic Engineering and professional services at their massive scale and with continued implementation support,</em>" said Gary Alterson, Vice President, Security Solutions at Rackspace Technology. "<em>Since partnering with Cloudflare to develop Zero Trust solutions, we've already seen strong engagement with clients and prospects such as the likes of one of the world's largest creative companies.</em>"</p>
	<p>"<em>With the launch of this new Cloudflare One Partner Program including integrated zero trust focused solution bundles and partner enablement, we look forward to further expanding our go-to-market with Cloudflare and helping customers smoothly and quickly transform their network security by adopting a zero trust strategy for protecting their infrastructure, teams and applications,</em>" stated Deborah Jones, Senior Product Marketing Manager, Alliances, IBM Security Services.</p>
	<p>"<em>Assurance Data's charter is to deliver integrated security solutions for next-generation cyber defense. We're thrilled to work with Cloudflare, adding their innovative, 100% cloud-native Zero Trust solutions to our technology portfolio and appreciate the significant investment they are making in the partner channel, with deep partner enablement and service delivery support along with rich incentives. &nbsp;The new Cloudflare One Partner Program is truly a triple win: a win for us, for our Cloudflare partnership and for our customers,</em>" stated Randy Stephens, COO, Assurance Data.</p>
	<p>"<em>Zero Trust is no-brainer, but many people still believe it's too complex,</em>" stated Scott McCrady, CEO, SolCyber. "Cloudflare has made it easy with the new Cloudflare One Partner Program. We love it because it helps our customers get integrated Zero Trust solutions in place fast, with all the enablement and incentives you would expect from a first-rate partner program."</p>
	<h3 id="how-is-the-cloudflare-one-partner-program-different-from-cloudflare-s-general-partner-program">How is the Cloudflare One Partner program different from Cloudflare’s general Partner Program?</h3>
	<p>This new program builds on top of the benefits of the existing partner program. So all the current benefits provided to partners are available, but there are a few valuable additions for Cloudflare One partners: Product suites are listed with Distribution partners and available for VARs and other partners to quote and fulfill; We’ve added Accreditations and new training packages, so that partners have rich resources and training on which to build and enhance their own service practices; Incentives for partners are enhanced with well-structured discounts off the list prices available to partners at our Distribution partners including extra incentives that follow a “reward for value” model.</p>
