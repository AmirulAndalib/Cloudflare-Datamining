	<p>Earlier this week, Cloudflare automatically detected and mitigated a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack">DDoS attack</a> that peaked just below 2 Tbps â€” the largest weâ€™ve seen to date. This was a multi-vector attack combining <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack">DNS amplification </a>attacks and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/udp-flood-ddos-attack">UDP floods</a>. The entire attack lasted just one minute. The attack was launched from approximately 15,000 bots running a variant of the original Mirai code on IoT devices and <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/11/01/gitlab-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-cve-2021-22205-exploited-in-the-wild">unpatched GitLab instances</a>. </p>

	<h3 id="network-layer-ddos-attacks-increased-by-44-">Network-layer DDoS attacks increased by 44%</h3>
	<p>Last quarter, we saw multiple terabit-strong DDoS attacks and this attack continues this trend of increased attack intensity. Another key finding from our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-attack-trends-for-2021-q3">Q3 DDoS Trends report</a> was that network-layer DDoS attacks actually increased by 44% quarter-over-quarter. While the fourth quarter is not over yet, we have, again, seen multiple terabit-strong attacks that targeted Cloudflare customers.</p>

	<h3 id="how-did-cloudflare-mitigate-this-attack">How did Cloudflare mitigate this attack?</h3>
	<p>To begin with, our systems constantly analyze traffic samples â€œout-of-pathâ€ which allows us to asynchronously detect DDoS attacks without causing latency or impacting performance. Once the attack traffic was detected (within sub-seconds), our systems generated a real-time signature that surgically matched against the attack patterns to mitigate the attack without impacting legitimate traffic.</p>
	<p>Once generated, the fingerprint is propagated as an ephemeral mitigation rule to the most optimal location in the Cloudflare edge for cost-efficient mitigation. In this specific case, as with most L3/4 DDoS attacks, the rule was pushed in-line into the Linux kernel <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/l4drop-xdp-ebpf-based-ddos-mitigations">eXpress Data Path</a> (XDP) to drop the attack packet at wirespeed.</p>

	<h3 id="helping-build-a-better-internet">Helping build a better Internet</h3>
	<p>Cloudflareâ€™s mission is to help build a better Internet â€” one that is secure, faster, and more reliable for everyone. The DDoS teamâ€™s vision is derived from this mission: our goal is to make the impact of DDoS attacks a thing of the past. Whether it's the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/meris-botnet">Meris botnet</a> that launched some of the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-thwarts-17-2m-rps-ddos-attack-the-largest-ever-reported">largest HTTP DDoS attacks on record</a>, the recent <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/update-on-voip-attacks">attacks on VoIP providers</a> or this Mirai-variant thatâ€™s DDoSing Internet properties, Cloudflareâ€™s network automatically detects and mitigates DDoS attacks. Cloudflare provides a secure, reliable, performant, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-ddos-managed-rules">customizable</a> platform for Internet properties of all types.</p>
