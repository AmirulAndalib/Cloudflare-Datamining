To give you some sense, across the CloudFlare\nnetwork every minute we write a half a Gigabyte of just log data.\nCollecting, reducing, sorting, and displaying that data back to you is\none of the biggest challenges of running a service like CloudFlare. Over\nthe last few days we&apos;ve been upgrading our core logging infrastructure\nto make the displaying portion a lot faster. We want our stats page to\nbe lightening quick whenever you load it or run a query. We were hitting\nan I/O bottleneck with some queries that produced what we felt were\nunacceptably slow results. While we have some long-term plans on how to\nenhance the core storage architecture to get around this, in the short\nterm we needed a fix we knew would work so we turned to our friends at\n<a href=\"http://fusionio.com/\">Fusion-IO</a>.</p>\n<p>Lee had used Fusion-IO cards at <a href=\"http://www.projecthoneypot.org/\">Project Honey\nPot</a> to get around file system\nlimitations, and at CloudFlare we had become even more familiar with\nthem because some of our investors were also investors in Fusion. Plus\nSteve Wozniak is on their Board of Directors and, as Damon has pointed\nout on Twitter, we have a <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=434528210431\">Woz\nninja</a>. If you&apos;re\nnot familiar with Fusion-IO, here&apos;s all you need to know: they&apos;ll make\nsomething other than I/O the bottleneck on your system.</p>\n<p>Over the last few days we&apos;ve moved the parts of the stats database that\nneed to be fast onto Fusion-IO cards. Moving that much data and\nrebuilding indexes took longer than we anticipated. However, as we\nanticipated the bottleneck was the slow media and CPU, not the new\nFusion cards. Going forward, we&apos;ll be evaluating their performance and\ndeciding whether to incorporate them into our core storage architecture\nmore broadly. In the meantime, sorry for the downtime with stats being\ndisplayed. Rest assured that we we&apos;ve been gathering data all that time\nand what&apos;s not already back online will trickle in over the next day.\nAnd, best of all, the page to view your stats should now be a lot\nfaster.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
