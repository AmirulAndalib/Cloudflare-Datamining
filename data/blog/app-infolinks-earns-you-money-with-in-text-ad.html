	<p>At CloudFlare, we're interested in making running a website easier. That's a broad definition, on purpose, going far beyond security and performance.</p>
	<p>If your goal is making money from your website, we want to make that easier, too.</p>
	<p>So we're pleased to introduce Infolinks to CloudFlare customers. Available now, the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/infolinks">Infolinks app</a> will automatically add in-text ads to your website.</p>
	<h3>How It Works</h3>
	<p>Infolinks turns keywords into relevant ads, which only trigger when a website visitor hovers over the link, as in the screenshot below. Infolinks operates in real time, extracting content and determining intent. The automatically-created in-text ads overcome "banner blindness" delivering a richer experience for your visitors right on your website. You earn revenue when your visitors click on the ads. Monthly payments are sent to your bank or PayPal account.</p>

	<p>To enable Infolinks, you don't need to change the layout of your site.Instead, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/infolinks">turn on the app</a> in your CloudFlare dashboard, and upon approval, the Infolinks code will be applied by CloudFlare to your sites, automatically turning keywords into relevant ads.</p>
	<h3>A Few Things to Note</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Infolinks is appropriate for publishers with rich content.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Infolinks is not compatible with every website. Websites with adult or offensive content are not allowed. Every website goes through a manual review process by the Infolinks team.</p>
