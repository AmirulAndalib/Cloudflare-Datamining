Within several hours, CloudFlare presented its initial <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-transparency-report-on-national-security-orders\">Transparency Report on National Security Orders</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"I&apos;m the Count.

The report does not include non-governmental requests.</p>\n<p>All totaled, the requests received affected fewer than 0.017% of the more than 2 million CloudFlare customers domains.</p>\n<p>CloudFlare operates a global network and is extremely mindful of the responsibility that comes with that privileged position. It is CloudFlare’s <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy\">overriding privacy principle</a> to protect and secure our customers’ information; we will not sell, rent, or give away any of their personal information without their consent.
