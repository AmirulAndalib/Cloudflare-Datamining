	<p>We have rolled out automatic protection for all customers for the the newly announced vulnerability called <a href="https://httpoxy.org">httpoxy</a>.</p>
	<p>This vulnerability affects applications that use “classic” CGI execution models, and could lead to API token disclosure of the services that your application may talk to.</p>
	<p>By default httpoxy requests are modified to be harmless and then request is allowed through, however customers who want to outright block those requests can also use the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf">Web Application Firewall</a> rule 100050 in CloudFlare Specials to block requests that could lead to the httpoxy vulnerability.</p>
