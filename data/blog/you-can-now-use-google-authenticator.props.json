Without a second factor, any mishap involving your password can lead to a compromise. Journalist Mat Honan’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\">high profile compromise</a> in 2012 is a great example of the importance of two-factor authentication. When he later <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\">wrote about the incident</a> he said, &quot;Had I used two-factor authentication for my Google account, it’s possible that none of this would have happened.&quot;</p><h3>What is a TOTP app?</h3><p><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238\">TOTP (Time-based One Time Password)</a> is the mechanism that Google Authenticator, Authy and other two-factor authentication apps use to generate short-lived authentication codes. <a href=\"/choosing-a-two-factor-authentication-system\">We’ve written previously on the blog</a> about how TOTP works.</p><p>We didn’t want to limit you to only using two-factor providers that we&#39;d built integrations with, so we built an open TOTP integration in the Cloudflare dashboard, allowing you to set up two-factor with any app that implements TOTP. That means you can choose from a wide array of apps for logging into Cloudflare securely with two-factor such as <a href=\"https://m.vip.symantec.com/home.v\">Symantec</a>, <a href=\"https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile\">Duo Mobile</a> and <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/guides/ios/?q=totp\">1Password</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2NRvcimd3ivJwDuKgGRIOC/7d06b92043406d3897462048d237c9e9/Screen-Shot-2017-02-15-at-3.59.18-PM_5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"240\" height=\"342\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>Get Started</h3><p>If you want to enable Two-Factor Authentication with Google Authenticator or any other TOTP provider, visit <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com/a/account/my-account\">your account settings here</a>.
