SOME STUNNING UPSETS! MILLIONS OF BRACKETS BUSTED! IT’S AWESOME (and sometimes awful), BABY!</p><p>Whew… Got that out of the way.</p><p>So, what have we learned from the first two rounds of the Annual March Hackness phishing tournament?</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has definitely played into what attackers are using in their business.</p><p>The proof? Cinderella runs thus far for some of our (not-so-Sweet) 16 of top-impersonated newcomers: the <strong>World Health Organization</strong> (which we’ve seen daily in the news); <strong>Target</strong> (whose online sales surged by $10 billion last year); and <strong>DocuSign</strong> (whose revenue exploded by nearly 50%, thanks to post-COVID remote business). Reminiscent of Marquette’s 2013 run, in my opinion!</p><p>That said, our major players of <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> are still accounted for — they remain attackers’ favorite brands year after year. (Case in point: our security research team <a href=\"https://threatpost.com/office-365-phishing-attack-financial-execs/164925/\">recently uncovered</a> a highly sophisticated Microsoft 365 phishing campaign targeting financial departments and unsuspecting assistants and CEOs).</p><p>But … who honestly could have predicted <strong>PayPal</strong> getting knocked out in the first round? Our 2019 March Hackness Champion goes home early! Congratulations to them for being Most Improved (aka, less spoofed)!</p><p>Remember folks, in our phishing bracket, a first round knockout is actually a badge of honor!</p><p>Which brings us into the Not-So-Sweet 16. Can the WHO continue its historic run? Can Twitter upset the Duke-esque status of Microsoft? Will Facebook survive a matchup against Amazon? Only time will tell!</p><p>The Madness is setting in!</p><p><em><strong>Let’s check back with Dicky V for analysis of the perfect phishing bracket:</strong></em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/10/image1-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"some-takeaways-for-the-sweet-16\">Some takeaways for the Sweet 16?</h3><ul><li>OH BABY! We’ve got quite a few Juggernaut matchups! Microsoft has that champion pedigree but Twitter is a strong contender!</li><li>Facebook vs Amazon! That’s a championship matchup in its own right … expect a lot of fireworks there!</li><li>I like Apple’s odds of making it to the finals!</li><li>I think our Cinderella, the WHO, might be making it to the ball!</li></ul><p><strong>Tune in on April 5th to see who will be crowned our OPHISHAL Champion for 2021! IT’S AWESOME BABY!</strong></p><h3 id=\"and-now-some-additional-analysis\">And Now Some Additional Analysis</h3><p>By the way, in case you’re wondering: <em>is email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) THE winning way to stop brand spoofing and impersonation-based phishing attacks from ever reaching inboxes?</em></p><p>The answer is: <strong>No. </strong>Over the past year, we’ve blocked 22 million of these types of phishing attacks — <strong>and while we know all three standards can help with preventing </strong><em><strong>some</strong></em><strong> forms of phishing, attackers can </strong><a href=\"https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/2153307/lp/3955867/how-bad-actors-get-past-dmarc-in-60-minutes-or-less\"><strong>easily bypass email authentication</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The SPF, DKIM and DMARC standards are certainly useful for validating server and tenant origins, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/protect-domains-without-email/\">protecting message integrity</a> and providing policy enforcement. However, security professionals should know that: </p><ol><li><em>Anyone can set up emails that pass email authentication.</em></li><li><em>Email authentication does not inspect content.</em></li><li><em>Email authentication does not protect against look-alike domains</em>.</li><li><em>Email authentication does not protect against compromised domains</em>.</li><li><em>The vast majority of organizations and domains do not use email authentication</em>.</li><li><em>Email authentication can be difficult to set up properly.</em></li></ol><p>Below is a brief description of what each standard does, what types of threats it can protect against and what types of threats it <em>cannot</em> protect against.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table width =\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th colspan=\"3\">SPF <br>(Sender Policy Framework)</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Purpose</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Validating server origin (i.e., validates where a message originates from)<br>Defining which email servers and services are allowed to send messages on a domain owner’s behalf</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Best for:</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Preventing spoofing of a legitimate email’s return address domain, i.e., the “Reply to” email address or return-path domain </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Limitations</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Does not prevent look-alike email, domain or display name spoofing<br>Does not validate the “From” header; uses envelope “From” to determine sending domain<br>Validation fails when emails are forwarded or when messages sent to a mailing list is sent to each subscriber <br>SPF evaluation process is limited to 10 DNS lookups<br>Does not protect against attacks using “validated” emails with embedded URLs, malicious payloads or attachments</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table width=\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th colspan=\"3\">DKIM <br>(Domain Keys Identified Mail)</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Purpose</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Providing tenant origin validation (i.e., checks that an email was sent/authorized by the owner of the domain via a digital signature)<br>Ensuring email is not altered while transferred from server to server; protecting message integrity</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Best for:</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Preventing spoofing of the “Display From” email address — the address usually shown to the end user when an email is opened</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Limitations</td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Does not prevent look-alike email, domain or display name spoofing<br>Does not protect against replay attacks (DKIM only signs specific parts of a message.
