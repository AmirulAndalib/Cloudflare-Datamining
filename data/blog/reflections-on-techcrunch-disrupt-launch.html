	<p>When Michelle, Lee, and I started working on Cloudflare back in the<br>
		Winter of 2009 the plan was always to launch at TechCrunch. You make<br>
		plans like that in order to give you some sense of a light at the end of<br>
		the very long tunnel that is building a startup, but it's rare that<br>
		things actually work out as you plan. We thought we were onto something<br>
		special based on the feedback from our early beta users, but Cloudflare<br>
		was really a long shot for TechCrunch. We're a tough story to tell,<br>
		we're not the typical TechCrunch consumer Internet company, and, as Mike<br>
		Arrington said on stage right before we won the award for "Most<br>
		Innovative Company," we're a bit "boring" and doing something akin to<br>
		"muffler repair" for the Internet.</p>
	<p>Turns out the Internet has had a broken muffler for a while, and seeing<br>
		the pent up demand for a service like Cloudflare has been awesome. In<br>
		the seven days since our launch, the traffic through our network has<br>
		increased almost 10x and, if you measure all the page views or unique<br>
		visitors passing through our site, in one week we went from the 1,000th<br>
		largest site online to one of the top 50. We now power more page views<br>
		and see more unique visitors than a major site like CNN.com. That's<br>
		pretty amazing.</p>
	<p>If you're a startup and you get a chance to launch at a TechCrunch<br>
		conference, I can't recommend it more highly. Heather, Erick, Mike, and<br>
		everyone else on the TechCrunch team were professional and worked hard<br>
		to make sure we told Cloudflare's story in as compelling a way as<br>
		possible. The launch of a startup is a sacred event. You only get to do<br>
		it once. We couldn't have been happier with how Cloudflare's went, and<br>
		we can't wait to tell everyone what we're up to next!</p>
