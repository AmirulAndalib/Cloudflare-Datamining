It may be used for talks, workshops, panels, networking sessions, and more.</p><p>There is a large entry way for people coming into our 6th floor lobby where check-in may be managed. Once inside the event space, you will see a large, open kitchen area which can be used to set up event food and beverages. Beyond that is Cloudflare&#39;s All-Hands Auditorium space, which may be used for your events.</p><p>We have several gender-neutral toilets for your guests&#39; use as well.</p><h4>Lobby</h4><p>You may welcome your guests here. The event space is just to the left of this spot.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2OxywIjNU6hCPoq9eti34z/546678f2682d4a8be2837a0812121764/CF-London-Office---Reception-2020.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h4>Set-up</h4><p>We can rearrange seating, based on the format of your meetup or event.
