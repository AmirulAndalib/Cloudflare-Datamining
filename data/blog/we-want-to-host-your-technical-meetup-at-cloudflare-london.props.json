It may be used for talks, workshops, panels, networking sessions, and more.</p><p>There is a large entry way for people coming into our 6th floor lobby where check-in may be managed. Once inside the event space, you will see a large, open kitchen area which can be used to set up event food and beverages. Beyond that is Cloudflare's All-Hands Auditorium space, which may be used for your events. </p><p>We have several gender-neutral toilets for your guests' use as well.</p><h4 id=\"lobby\">Lobby</h4><p>You may welcome your guests here.

You are welcome to order additional food if you can be present to receive it and set it up. (We recommend appetizers/food that can be kept at room temperature, since we do not allow open-flame sternos.)</p><p>If your meetup is eligible, we may even be able to sponsor your additional food orders.
