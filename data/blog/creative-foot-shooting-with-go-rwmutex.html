	<p>Hi, I'm Filippo and today I managed to surprise myself! (And not in a good way.)</p>
	<p>I'm developing a new module ("filter" as we call them) for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/rrdns">RRDNS</a>, CloudFlare's Go DNS server. It's a rewrite of the authoritative module, the one that adds the IP addresses to DNS answers.</p>
	<p>It has a table of CloudFlare IPs that looks like this:</p>
	<pre class="language-go"><code class="language-go">type IPMap struct {
	sync.RWMutex
	M map[string][]net.IP
}</code></pre>
	<p>It's a global filter attribute:</p>
	<pre class="language-go"><code class="language-go">type V2Filter struct {
	name       string
	IPTable    *IPMap
	// [...]
}</code></pre>

	<p>The table changes often, so a background goroutine periodically reloads it from our distributed key-value store, acquires the lock (<code>f.IPTable.Lock()</code>), updates it and releases the lock (<code>f.IPTable.Unlock()</code>). This happens every 5 minutes.</p>
	<p>Everything worked in tests, including multiple and concurrent requests.</p>
	<p>Today we deployed to an off-production test machine and everything worked. For a few minutes. Then RRDNS stopped answering queries for the beta domains served by the new code.</p>
	<p>What. _That worked on my laptop_â„¢.</p>
	<p>Here's the IPTable consumer function. You can probably spot the bug.</p>
	<pre class="language-go"><code class="language-go">func (f *V2Filter) getCFAddr(...) (result []dns.RR) {
	f.IPTable.RLock()
	// [... append IPs from f.IPTable.M to result ...]
	return
}</code></pre>
	<p><code>f.IPTable.RUnlock()</code> is never called. Whoops. But it's an RLock, so multiple <code>getCFAddr</code> calls should work, and only table reloading should break, no? Instead <code>getCFAddr</code> started blocking after a few minutes. To the docs!</p>
	<p><i>To ensure that the lock eventually becomes available, a blocked Lock call excludes new readers from acquiring the lock.</i> <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#RWMutex.Lock">https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#RWMutex.Lock</a></p>
	<p>So everything worked and RLocks piled up until the table reload function ran, then the pending Lock call caused all following RLock calls to block, breaking RRDNS answer generation.</p>
	<p>In tests the table reload function never ran while answering queries, so <code>getCFAddr</code> kept piling up RLock calls but never blocked.</p>
	<p>No customers were affected because A) the release was still being tested on off-production machines and B) no real customers run on the new code yet. Anyway it was a interesting way to cause a deferred deadlock.</p>
	<p>In closing, there's probably space for a better tooling here. A static analysis tool might output a listing of all Lock/Unlock calls, and a dynamic analysis tool might report still [r]locked Mutex at the end of tests. (Or maybe these tools already exist, in which case let me know!)</p>
