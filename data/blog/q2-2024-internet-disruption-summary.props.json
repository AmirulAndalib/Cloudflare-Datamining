Sometimes more mundane technical issues can cause problems when users try to access the Internet. One example of this occurred on April 15 in Malaysia, when customers of <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as9930\">Time Internet</a> experienced a network outage for nearly two hours. The company explained the reason for the outage in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TimeInternet/posts/pfbid0RbJE44cgJvxA9FQSKFTVoe4NbJBdGuwkyXjuB5URiAW78zmgS5x1V8YPUt91ym9Al\">contrite post on their Facebook page</a>, stating in part “<em>This Internet service outage was by far the worst in our history - affecting approximately 40% of our customers. … At 5.38pm today, both our primary and secondary Secure DNS servers became unreachable. This means that any browser or service requiring a DNS address resolution was not able to reach its intended site.</em>” Because subscribers could not reach Time Internet’s DNS resolvers, they were unable to resolve hostnames for Internet services, sites, and applications, including those delivered by Cloudflare. This resulted in the drop in traffic seen in the graph below, which started just after 17:00 local time (05:00 UTC), and began to recover approximately an hour later. The company did not provide any additional information on what caused the DNS servers to fail.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-04-15&dateEnd=2024-04-15&location=as9930&chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D\" title=\"Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"nepal\">Nepal</h3><p>In Nepal, a number of local Internet service providers including <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as45650\">AS45650 (Vianet)</a> and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as139922\">AS139922 (Dishhome)</a> rely on Indian provider <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as9498\">Bharti Airtel</a> for upstream connectivity, enabling them to reach the rest of the Internet. A <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/05/01/isps-warn-of-possible-internet-disruption\">published report</a> underscores the reliance, noting “<em>Nepali ISPs buy 70 percent of their internet from Airtel.</em>”</p><p>On April 25, these ISPs <a href=\"https://www.nepalitelecom.com/latest-internet-shutdown-saga-in-nepal\">warned</a> that their services could be interrupted because the Nepali government had not provided them with foreign exchange services that would enable them to pay bandwidth vendors such as Airtel, whom they reportedly owed USD $30 million to. On May 1, Airtel informed the delinquent Nepali providers that Internet services may be interrupted at any time due to the overdue payment, and on May 2, Airtel took that step. The graphs below show Vianet’s traffic dropping to near zero at 16:15 local time (10:30 UTC), recovering to expected levels six hours later. An hour later, at 17:15 local time (11:30 UTC), Dishhome’s traffic dropped significantly, though not as severely as Vianet’s. Dishhome’s traffic also recovered approximately six hours later.</p><p>Dishhome may not have experienced a near-complete outage like Vianet did because Bharti Airtel is one of <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as132799?dateStart=2024-05-02&amp;dateEnd=2024-05-02\">four upstream providers used by its parent company</a>, whereas Bharti Airtel is <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as45650?dateStart=2024-05-02&amp;dateEnd=2024-05-02\">one of Vianet's two upstream providers</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-05-02&dateEnd=2024-05-02&location=as45650&chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D\" title=\"Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-05-02&dateEnd=2024-05-02&location=as139922&chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D\" title=\"Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>A month later, on June 3, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as45650\">AS45650 (Vianet)</a> and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as17501\">AS17501 (Worldlink)</a> in Nepal experienced Internet disruptions that were <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/internet-slowdown-across-nepal-due-to-airtel-network-issues/\">reportedly</a> caused by routing issues on Bharti Airtel’s network.

However, what is particularly interesting is the spike in traffic to Cloudflare from Starlink’s network following the resolution of the outage. The sharp increase and rapid decline of the traffic curve after service was restored suggests that it may be related to an automated connectivity check of some kind, rather than pent-up user demand for content.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2024-05-28&dateEnd=2024-05-29&location=as14593&chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D\" title=\"Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"chad-1\">Chad</h3><p>A near-complete Internet outage was observed in <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/td\">Chad</a> on June 5 between 08:15 - 12:00 local time (07:15 - 11:00 UTC), as seen in the graph below.

A failure in any one of these foundational components, whether due to a cable cut, power outage, misconfiguration, or government action, can have a significant impact, disrupting Internet connectivity for millions of users, potentially across multiple countries. While the resilience and reliability of the physical and technical components can be improved through redundancy and best practices, political factors have arguably proven to be the hardest to address. However, organizations like <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/\">AccessNow</a>, through their <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/keepiton/\">#KeepItOn</a> campaign, mobilize people, communities, and civil society actors globally to fight against government-directed Internet shutdowns, which can have <a href=\"https://pulse.internetsociety.org/en/netloss/\">significant financial consequences</a>.</p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> for additional insights around Internet disruptions, routing issues, Internet traffic trends, security and attacks, and Internet quality.
