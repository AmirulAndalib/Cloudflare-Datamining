We decided to open an office outside Silicon Valley for two major reasons: to get access to high quality software engineering, network operations and technical support folks, and to expand our 24/7 operations and support. Not to mention, London has a vibrant start-up community that we are very happy to now be a part of.</p>\n<p>London is 8 hours ahead of San Francisco making it the perfect location for a hand-over from a team arriving at work at 0900 in California (the London team is nearing the end of the day at 1700). By extending working hours a little it's easy to get 24 hour operations and support with just two offices.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Cribs: CloudFlare London\nEdition\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/4.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"Cribs: CloudFlare London Edition\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cribs: CloudFlare London\nEdition\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/4.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"Cribs: CloudFlare London Edition\"></noscript><br>\n<small>Lobby of our new London office</small></p>\n<p>And London's start-up community means there's a pool of talented people in engineering, operations and support for CloudFlare to hire from. Plus it enables CloudFlare to take part in the many <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/wordpress-london-meetup-january-2013\">meetups</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/go-london-user-group\">user groups</a> that flourish in and around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London_Tech_City\">Tech City</a> some of which we sponsor.</p>\n<p>We choose to be in the St. Paul's area because of its good public transport links to all parts of London and because the building we are in has everything from a restaurant, sports club to state of the art bicycle storage. Near by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_New_Change\">One New Change</a> and the surrounding area are full of shops and eateries. There's also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithfield_market#The_market\">Smithfield Market</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican\">Barbican</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Cribs: CloudFlare London Edition\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/noname-16.jpeg.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"Cribs: CloudFlare London Edition\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cribs: CloudFlare London Edition\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/noname-16.jpeg.scaled500.jpg\" title=\"Cribs: CloudFlare London Edition\"></noscript><br>\n<small>CloudFlare London hard at work</small></p>\n<p>And being in London brings us close to many of customers and partners such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/gosquared\">GoSquared</a>, <a href=\"http://www.namecheap.com/\">Namecheap</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/\">WebHostingBuzz</a>.</p>\n<p>We're actively hiring in both San Francisco and London.
