Because of this, Cloudflare sees significant IPv6 traffic globally where networks have enabled IPv6 to the consumer.</p>\n<p>The top IPv6 networks are shown here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2016/11/cloudflare-ipv6-percentage-vs-traffic.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2016/11/cloudflare-ipv6-percentage-vs-traffic.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n<p>The chart shows the percentage of IPv6 within a specific network vs. the relative bandwidth of that network. We will talk about specific networks below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whyipv6becausefastinternet\">Why IPv6? Because fast internet.</h3>\n<p>IPv6 is faster for two reasons. The first is that many major operating systems and browsers like <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg22455.html\">iOS, MacOS</a>, <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555\">Chrome and Firefox</a> impose anywhere from a 25ms to 300ms <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555\">artificial delay</a> on connections made over IPv4. The second is that some mobile networks won’t need to perform extra v4 -&gt; v6 and v6 -&gt; v4 translations to connect visitors to IPv6 enabled sites if the phone is only assigned an IPv6 address. (IPv6-only phones are becoming very common. If you have a phone on T-Mobile, Telstra, SK Telecom, Orange, or EE UK, to name a few, it’s likely you’re v6-only.)</p>\n<p>How much faster is IPv6? Our data shows that visitors connecting over IPv6 were able to connect and load pages in 27% less time than visitors connecting over IPv4. LinkedIn found an even more dramatic effect, with up to a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ipv6-measurements-zaid-ali-kahn\">40% performance boost</a> on mobile connections over IPv6. Facebook also found a significant performance increase, around <a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/1192894270727351/ipv6-it-s-time-to-get-on-board/\">10-15% on IPv6</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whoandwhatisdrivingipv6\">Who and what is driving IPv6?</h3>\n<p>IPv6 is clearly important for driving a faster, better internet, so who is driving IPv6 adoption?</p>\n<p>In terms of countries, Belgium leads by a mile. Over the last 30 days, 56.47% of traffic (in bytes) to Belgians on Cloudflare has been over IPv6. This is largely due to Telenet, an ISP in Belgium, doing almost 96.8% of their traffic over IPv6!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Belgium, 56.47%</li>\n<li>Ireland, 31.75%*</li>\n<li>Greece, 20.79%</li>\n<li>Germany, 15.87%</li>\n<li>Ecuador, 15.62%</li>\n<li>Luxembourg, 15.51%</li>\n<li>Portugal, 14.07%</li>\n<li>Estonia, 13.75%</li>\n<li>India, 11.84%</li>\n<li>Peru, 10.57%</li>\n</ol>\n<p>*The Irish numbers are artificially high due to <a href=\"http://bgp.he.net/search?search%5Bsearch%5D=facebook\">several of Facebook’s IPv6 ranges being registered in Ireland</a>. Facebook does an enormous amount of traffic over IPv6 –– 81% of Facebook’s traffic through Cloudflare is IPv6. In fact, Facebook’s crawling over IPv6 actually accounts for 6.9% of Cloudflare’s total outbound IPv6 traffic.</p>\n<p>If you look just 6 months ago, less than 1% of India’s traffic was over IPv6. India has experienced an amazing rise in IPv6 connectivity, especially over the last month and a half.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-15-at-4.29.22-PM.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-15-at-4.29.22-PM.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n<p>The US is ranked 17th on the global list at 8.78%. And since we have a Canadian co-founder (and three Canadian PoPs), it hasn’t gone unnoticed at Cloudflare that Canada is just beating the US in 16th place at 9.14%.</p>\n<p>A handful of networks are responsible for the majority of IPv6 traffic through Cloudflare. In fact, the top 10 networks by IPv6 traffic to and from Cloudflare are responsible for over half (55.4%) of Cloudflare’s IPv6 traffic. Those networks are:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-16-at-2.56.58-PM.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-16-at-2.56.58-PM.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n<p>The above chart shows which networks account for the highest percentage of IPv6 traffic through Cloudflare. In terms of which networks are promoting IPv6 on their own network traffic, these are the networks Cloudflare sees with the highest ratios of IPv6 to IPv4 traffic:</p>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th
