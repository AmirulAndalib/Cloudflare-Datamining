	<h3>Be The First To Know If Your Website Goes Down</h3>
	<p>You use CloudFlare because you want high performance, reliability, and security. Website owners deserve nothing less. Because we believe in transparency, we provide insight into our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/system-status.html">system status</a>. Still, it's important to have third-party verification, so we encourage the use of outside monitors.</p>
	<p>Today's App can help. Pingdom is a leader in uptime monitoring. From your CloudFlare dashboard, you can create a Pingdom account with free monitoring for a single domain. For those with multiple domains or more complex requirements, the upgrade is easy.</p>
