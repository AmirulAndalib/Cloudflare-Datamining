	<p>DNS records are hard. &nbsp;Many people, even the technically competent, don’t understand more than the basics.</p>

	<p>I'll speak for myself — as someone who always learned just enough about DNS to get it working, then immediately forgot everything until the next time it broke. It was a vicious cycle until I convinced myself to learn it in depth. &nbsp;Meanwhile, non-technical folks wisely avoid meddling in such dangerous affairs all together.</p>
	<p>Surely, there must be a better way (this is a blog post after all).</p>
	<p>Every day, thousands of Cloudflare users add DNS records to their Internet properties to configure awesome tools like G Suite, Shopify, Wordpress, Ghost, and thousands of others. &nbsp;A new Cloudflare Apps feature allows apps to <i>automatically set up and manage configurable DNS records</i> on more than 12 million registered domains on the Cloudflare network. In short, Cloudflare Apps are here to alleviate the Internet’s collective DNS woes.</p>
	<p>Gone are the days of tribulating over whether it’s <code>A</code> or <code>CNAME</code> you should set. &nbsp;Gone are the days of puzzling between <code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code> records while wondering what the heck happened to <code>AA</code> and <code>AAA</code> records? &nbsp;Unload your DNS dysphoria onto highly trained developers experienced at explicating these burdensome questions today!</p>

	<p>Did you know?</p>
	<p>Are you a highly trained developer? &nbsp;Cloudflare now provides the tools to build robust, powerful apps that automate DNS record management saving countless developer hours that are currently spent fiddling with DNS. &nbsp;Instead of manually configuring records to integrate with your solution provider, build a Cloudflare App that does it for you and <i>for everyone else on the Internet</i>.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/pointless-dns-app">Pointless DNS</a> is a demo app that showcases the new DNS feature by installing a (pointless) <code>TXT</code> record on any root or subdomain of your choice. &nbsp;The <code>TXT</code> record is configured and managed by the Pointless DNS app. &nbsp;Go ahead and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/uJ2Lfocw919J/install?version=1.0.2">install it</a> to see automated DNS record management with Cloudflare Apps.</p>

	<p>The TXT record name was set to "blog" during installation</p>
	<p>After installation, head over to your <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?zone=dns">DNS dashboard</a> and you'll see the app doing its thing. &nbsp;If you really want to, you can uninstall it from your <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?zone=apps%2Finstalled-apps">Installed Apps</a> page.</p>

	<p>Pointless DNS automatically manages its TXT record on my blog subdomain</p>
	<p>To start building your own DNS app, download <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare-apps/create-cloudflare-app">create-cloudflare-app</a> and open it in your preferred text editor. &nbsp;Below, I’ll explain how Pointless DNS manages its configurable <code>TXT</code> record.</p>
	<p>In the <code>install.json</code> file, you’ll find a <code>dns</code> field that looks like this:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"># install.json

"dns": [{
    "type": "TXT",
    "content": "Managed TXT Record",
    "name": "Created by create-cloudflare-app",
    "ttl": 120
  }]</code></pre>
	<p>This says a <code>TXT</code> record will be set up and managed on the app installer's site, which can only be modified or deleted through the app’s configuration page. &nbsp;Apps can create or modify any type of Cloudflare DNS record available in Cloudflare's <a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/#dns-records-for-a-zone-create-dns-record">DNS API</a>.</p>
	<p>Now let's add in some configuration. Add an install option and point it at your record — <code>options.subdomain</code> will be set to the installer's desire.</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"># install.json

{
  "options": {
    "properties": {
      "subdomain": {
        "order": 1,
        "type": "string",
        "title": "TXT Record Subdomain",
        "description": "The subdomain of your DNS record",
        "placeholder": "*Required - e.g. [your_domain].com",
        "required": true
      }
    }
  },
  "dns": [{
    "type": "TXT",
    "name": "{{options.subdomain}}",
    "content": "{{options.subdomain}} was set"
  }]
}</code></pre>
	<p>That's all there is to it. &nbsp;Check out the Cloudflare Apps <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/developer/docs/dns">docs</a> to learn more about about building DNS apps. &nbsp;For additional inspiration, consider <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/mailchannels">Mailchannels</a> — a powerful <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security">email security solution</a> that manages DNS records to fight off pesky spammers and phishermen.</p>
