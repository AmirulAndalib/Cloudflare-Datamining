That’s why we’re excited to launch a new addition to the Cloudflare Workers platform: logs and exceptions from the dashboard.</p><p>Starting today, you can view and filter the <code>console.log</code> output and exceptions from a Worker… at no additional cost with no configuration needed!</p><h3 id=\"view-logs-just-a-click-away\">View logs, just a click away</h3><p>When you view a Worker in the dashboard, you’ll now see a “Logs” tab which you can click on to view a detailed stream of logs and exceptions. Here’s what it looks like in action:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 63.24999999999999%;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/795b200ef205efae15fccdd159d5beb8?preload=true\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\"  allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Each log entry contains an event with a list of logs, exceptions, and request headers if it was triggered by an HTTP request. We also automatically redact sensitive URLs and headers such as Authorization, Cookie, or anything else that appears to have a sensitive name.</p><p>If you are in the Durable Objects <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/durable-objects-open-beta/\">open beta</a>, you will also be able to view the logs and requests sent to <em>each</em> Durable Object. This is a great tool to help you understand and debug the interactions between your Worker and a Durable Object.</p><p>For now, we support filtering by event status and type. Though, you can expect more filters to be added to the dashboard very soon! Today, we support advanced filtering with the wrangler CLI, which will be discussed later in this blog.</p><h3 id=\"console-log-and-you-re-all-set\">console.log(), and you’re all set</h3><p>It’s really simple to get started with logging for Workers. Simply invoke one of the standard <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console\">console</a> APIs, such as <code>console.log()</code>, and we handle the rest. That’s it! There’s no extra setup, no configuration needed, and no hidden logging fees.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function logRequest (request) {\n  const { cf, headers } = request\n  const { city, region, country, colo, clientTcpRtt  } = cf\n  \n  console.log(\"Detected location:\", [city, region, country].filter(Boolean).join(\", \"))\n  if (clientTcpRtt) {\n     console.debug(\"Round-trip time from client to\", colo, \"is\", clientTcpRtt, \"ms\")\n  }\n\n  // You can also pass an object, which will be interpreted as JSON.\n  // This is great if you want to define your own structured log schema.\n  console.log({ headers })\n}</code></pre><p>In fact, you don’t even need to use <code>console.log</code> to view an event from the dashboard. If your Worker doesn’t generate any logs or exceptions, you will still be able to see the request headers from the event.</p><h3 id=\"advanced-filters-from-your-terminal\">Advanced filters, from your terminal</h3><p>If you need more advanced filters you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler\">wrangler</a>, our command-line tool for deploying Workers. We’ve updated the <code>wrangler tail</code> command to support sampling and a new set of advanced filters. You also no longer need to install or configure <code>cloudflared</code> to use the command. Not to mention it’s <em>much</em> faster, no more waiting around for logs to appear. Here are a few examples:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Filter by your own IP address, and if there was an uncaught exception.\nwrangler tail --format=pretty --ip-address=self --status=error\n\n# Filter by HTTP method, then apply a 10% sampling rate.\nwrangler tail --format=pretty --method=GET --sampling-rate=0.1\n\n# Filter using a generic search query.\nwrangler tail --format=pretty --search=\"TypeError\"</code></pre><p>We recommend using the “pretty” format, since wrangler will output your logs in a colored, human-readable format. (We’re also working on a similar display for the dashboard.)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 47%;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/401421eff1a14f81c50e563212c3f48d?preload=true\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\"  allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>However, if you want to access structured logs, you can use the “json” format. This is great if you want to pipe your logs to another tool, such as <a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/\">jq</a>, or save them to a file. Here are a few more examples:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Parses each log event, but only outputs the url.\nwrangler tail --format=json | jq .event.request?.url\n\n# You can also specify --once to disconnect the tail after receiving the first log.\n# This is useful if you want to run tests in a CI/CD environment.\nwrangler tail --format=json --once &gt; event.json</code></pre><h3 id=\"try-it-out-\">Try it out!</h3><p>Both logs from the dashboard and <code>wrangler tail</code> are available and free for existing Workers customers.
