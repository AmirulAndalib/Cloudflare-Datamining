But a lot of care, hard work — not to mention dogfooding — later, we’ve been absolutely blown away by the use cases and applications built on our developer platform, not to mention the community that’s grown around the product.</p><p>My job isn’t just speaking to developers who are already using Cloudflare Workers, however. I spend a lot of time talking to developers who aren’t yet using Workers, too. Despite how cool the tech is — the performance, the ability to just code without worrying about anything else like containers, and the total cost advantages — there are two things that cause developers to hesitate in engaging with us on Workers.</p><p>The first: they worry about being locked in. No matter how bullish on the technology you are, if you’re betting the future of a company on a development platform, you don’t want the possibility of being held to ransom. And second: as a developer, you want a local development environment to quickly iterate and test your changes. These concerns might seem unrelated, but they always come up in the form of the same question: can Cloudflare please open source the runtime?</p><p>We’re excited to put these concerns to bed. <strong>As the first announcement of Platform Week, today Cloudflare is announcing the open sourcing of the Workers runtime under the Apache-2.0 license!</strong></p><p>While the code itself will be the best answer to most of the questions you have (we still have some work to do before we’re ready to share it), the questions we did want to answer today were: why are we doing this, and why now?</p><p>Development on the web has always been done in the open. If you’re like me, maybe your very first experience writing and looking at code was clicking on “View Source” on a website, and inspecting the HTML to see what pieces you could borrow. So many of the foundational pieces you build on today are open source, from the site, to the browser, to the many frameworks and libraries that are now available to developers. The same is true for us, so much of what we’re able to build is standing on the shoulders of giants like V8.</p><p>It was never our intention to introduce opaqueness into the stack, but in reality, when we first announced Workers five years ago, we took a really huge bet.</p><p>We wanted to give developers the ability to program on our network, but couldn’t do it at the expense of performance or security. While building on a battle tested technology like V8 seemed promising from a security standpoint, existing runtimes built on V8, couldn’t give us the security guarantees we needed to run a large multi-tenant environment, without the added security layer of a container, which would introduce latency (read: cold starts). Not only were cold starts not acceptable, but in reality, our data centers are much smaller than the centralized monoliths of traditional cloud. Even if we could run existing applications on the edge without cold starts, the code footprint would be far too large to enable every single one of our customers to have access to compute on every node of our global network.</p><p>So, we had to get inventive, and the first place we looked was web standards, or the Service Workers API. While Service Workers were designed to run in the browser, the model of Requests and Responses fit our use case really well. And, we liked the idea of the code you write being portable to other environments (and hoped that new players that came up would support the same model).</p><p>And that’s exactly what happened.</p><p>This all might seem obvious in retrospect, but at the time, it was a huge bet. We didn’t know at the time whether this was going to work. Whether this approach would take off, whether this would all work at scale, whether developers would adopt this model, despite it diverging from what JavaScript looked like on the server-side at the time…</p><p>What we did know was that we had a lot to prove, that we didn’t want to lock anyone in, and that open sourcing something properly is not an effort we wanted to take lightly. We wanted to support <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev\">our community</a> the same way we felt supported by all the open source projects we ourselves were building upon.</p><p>Now, it feels like we’re finally there, and we believe the next step in our runtime’s evolution is to give it to the world, and let developers build with it wherever they want, however they want.</p><p>Of course, since we’re talking about open source, we already know what you’re going to ask next: what license are we going to use? We plan to use the Apache-2.0 license — we want developers to be able to build on our platform freely.</p><h3 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h3><p>Open sourcing the runtime alone is not enough to allow developers to write code, free of lock in concerns, which is why we have another announcement coming up today.</p><p>And after that, well, if you’ve been following Cloudflare for a while, you know that there’s a certain time in the year, when we like to give back to the Internet. That might be a pretty good bet for the timing of what’s next! :-)</p>",
