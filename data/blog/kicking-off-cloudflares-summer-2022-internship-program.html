	<p>Fall is my favorite season for numerous reasons: the change in temperature, pumpkin spice flavored...everything, and of course, the start of the university recruitment cycle. I am excited to announce Cloudflare has begun hiring for our Summer 2022 internship program. We just opened many of our internship roles on our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/?department=University&amp;location=default">careers website</a> and will begin reviewing applications on a rolling basis. We are looking for Software Engineer, Product Management, Research, Data Science interns and more. We also have a host of virtual events and tech talks to engage prospective students throughout October and November. Find our event lineup below and RSVP through the attached links by clicking on the event titles.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->

	<p>In September, Cloudflare kicked off our fall university recruitment efforts by participating in the virtual Grace Hopper Celebration 2021 (#vGHC21) with a team of hiring managers and recruiters from various teams such as Software Engineering, Security, Research, and Product Management. We have sponsored this conference for years but this was our first experience participating virtually. We met and engaged with 1,000+ attendees through 1:1 conversations and tech talks in our virtual booth. Overall, we had an incredible experience with the virtual Grace Hopper Celebration this year and continue to be committed to hiring and providing opportunities for women at Cloudflare. </p>
	<p>This upcoming summer, we expect to have the largest intern class ever at Cloudflare. We have more opportunities on more teams than in any previous summer. To learn more about our Engineering and Product internship opportunities, please check out <a href="https://cloudflare.tv/event/eIF4Y0z8KKExEg5ADJIjS">this video</a> from our hiring managers last fall. Many of our interns have written blog posts about their experiences working at Cloudflare. Check out Meyer Zinn’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-magic-transit-health-checks-faster-and-more-responsive">blog post</a> from this past summer. Our intern opportunities are not limited to technical roles, we have a host of internships for MBA and J.D. students, as well as those in non-technical majors such as our Communications Internship. We will be opening these opportunities later this fall and early spring 2022. </p>
