CloudFlare meets my criteria as a reliable tool for small business owners and freelancers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdidyouhearaboutcloudflare\">How did you hear about CloudFlare?</h3>\n<p>I heard about CloudFlare from my friend <a href=\"http://www.lanecampbell.com/\">Lane Campbell</a>. He has been studying CDN's and ways to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/overview.html\">improve page load speeds</a> since around the time Google changed to their instant search algorithm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whydidyoujoincloudflare\">Why did you join CloudFlare?</h3>\n<p>After seeing the page load performance and blocked attacks that Lane showed me from one of the sites he had enrolled I decided to try it after a few weeks. I ended up joining one day because after reviewing what it takes to put a site in CloudFlare it was so simple that it literally took 5 minutes. Basically all a user has to do is <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22047501-What-is-DNS-\">change their name server</a> records. I also like knowing that attacks have been blocked from my sites. Using a CMS like <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">Wordpress</a> for many of my projects presents a general security risk, so having my sites protected at another layer gives me peace of mind.</p>\n<p>One of the other reasons I joined CloudFlare was because I had to find a service that helped me start out my projects on an affordable hosting service and grow from there. CloudFlare has allowed me to use budget hosts while conceptualizing a site or project. CloudFlare's performance boost makes it look like I am running a dedicated server instead of just<br>\na shared hosting account.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howmanysiteshaveyouputonthecloudflarenetwork\">How many sites have you put on the CloudFlare network?</h3>\n<p>Right now I have 5 sites, and I load all my new project sites into CloudFlare. In most cases even when I have the site under development I will load it into CloudfFlare at the beginning.</p>\n<p>My goal is to put any new sites I run into CloudFlare. For me the process of setting up a new website is a three step process and goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy a domain </li>\n<li>Setup hosting </li>\n<li>Enroll in CloudFlare</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/damonbillian/5406179178/\" title=\"zigzap 1 by dbillian, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"zigzap1\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5260/5406179178_20f47d4c39.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"zigzap1\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5260/5406179178_20f47d4c39.jpg\"></noscript></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"whatsbeenthebiggestsurpriseforyouusingcloudflare\">What's been the biggest surprise for you using CloudFlare?</h3>\n<p>Honestly, the ease of enrolling the sites was so much easier than I expected. 99% of the time it will be as simple as typing in your domain name, clicking &quot;Add this website&quot; and then updating your name servers at the domain level. It really takes 5 minutes, and the performance makes all the difference in the world.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatsyourfavoritecloudflarefeature\">What's your favorite CloudFlare feature?</h3>\n<p>I like the performance boost that my sites get. That is probably the first thing that I realize when enrolling a new site. The other piece that I enjoy is the dashboard that shows stats with blocked attacks and saved bandwidth:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/damonbillian/5406180622/\" title=\"zigzap2 by dbillian, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"zigzap2\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5212/5406180622_8015b8d3ed.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"zigzap2\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5212/5406180622_8015b8d3ed.jpg\"></noscript></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"whatwouldyourecommendthatnewcustomerstocloudflareknow\">What would you recommend that new customers to CloudFlare know?</h3>\n<p>There are two things that I think make a big difference when I recommend a new service:</p>\n<p>First - will it be easy?</p>\n<p>The answer with CloudFlare is YES! It's incredibly easy to use. You don't have to be an uber-nerd to handle this one.</p>\n<p>Second, are there any risks?</p>\n<p>No, everything happens seamlessly and there there is no downtime for the site. You can enroll immediately and see results as soon as DNS updates<br>\nacross the Internet.</p>\n<p>I personally love using CloudFlare and I would be happy to share my experience or answer any other questions you may have. Just <a href=\"http://gabearnold.com/contact-me/\">contact me</a> with any questions you may have.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
