	<p>Great news for everyone using CloudFlare on an e-commerce site, or a site accepting or processing credit card transactions.</p>
	<p>After undergoing a Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) 2.0 security control assessment, we’ve been certified as a Level 1 service provider. Achieving Level 1 status requires an assessment of our security controls by an independent third party—a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).</p>
	<p>Additionally, CloudFlare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf" target="_blank">Web Application Firewall</a> (WAF) helps companies meet PCI requirement 6.6. Our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/" target="_blank">WAF</a> not only helps protect our customers from application layer attacks, but also secures the data of online consumers making purchases on sites within the CloudFlare network.</p>
	<p>What’s even better is that we’ve achieved <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-pci-dss-compliance/" target="_blank">Level 1 PCI compliance</a> while still allowing for expansion of our global data center network. Over the coming weeks, we plan to turn on four new <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-map" target="_blank">data centers</a> in Madrid, Spain; Milan, Italy; Medellín, Colombia; and São Paulo, Brazil.</p>
	<p>Stay tuned for updates on these new locations!</p>
