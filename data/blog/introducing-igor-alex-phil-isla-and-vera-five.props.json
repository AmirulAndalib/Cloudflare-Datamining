There was a huge and unmet need among small and mid-sized websites\nfor better security and performance tools;2. We had great data from\n<a href=\"http://www.projecthoneypot.org/\">Project Honey Pot</a> and other partners\nthat could help us meet that need; but3. Virtually all the traditional\nsolutions designed for enterprises wouldn&apos;t work for the websites who\nmost needed help.</p>\n<p>If you&apos;re a big enterprise and you want performance and security you buy\nan expensive piece of hardware and contract with a [content delivery\nnetwork](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/) or highly connected data center. For the vast majority of\nwebsites online, this simply isn&apos;t an option. Not only is the cost\nprohibitive but most people with websites don&apos;t have access to their\nphysical servers to install hardware. We knew we had to come up with a\nbetter, more modern way to deploy Cloudflare.</p>\n<p>One of Lee&apos;s great ideas when he and I started Project Honey Pot nearly\nseven years ago was to ask people to donate a portion of their DNS\nrecords to let us build spam traps. We also used the DNS system to\ndeploy the Project&apos;s http:BL service. I&apos;m friends with David from\n<a href=\"http://www.opendns.com/\">OpenDNS</a> and liked how they were able to\ndeploy an amazing security product on the web-surfer end of DNS. So,\nknowing all that about DNS, we set out to build a system that used DNS\nto supercharge websites.</p>\n<p>For Cloudflare to work we needed to build a globally distributed network\nof DNS servers. When you sign up for Cloudflare we give you two name\nservers to list with your registrar for your domain. In reality, these\ntwo name servers actually point to a whole cluster of many servers\ndistributed in multiple data centers and load balanced (using anycast\nand other network voodoo) throughout the network.</p>\n<p>While most DNS providers give their nameservers boring names like\n&quot;<a href=\"http://ns1.someboringservice.net\">ns1.someboringservice.net</a>&quot;, we\nwanted ours to have a personality that represented just how amazing they\nare. We spent a lot of time trying to think of what embodied the spirit\nof what these nameservers do for our users until we stumbled upon it:\nninjas! They&apos;re fast. They&apos;re good at defending themselves. And they&apos;re\nstealthy. Just like Cloudflare.</p>\n<p>Today, when you sign up for Cloudflare, you are issued two Ninja\nNameservers&#x2122; (one male, one female). We have a lot so, every website you\nsign up, you&apos;re likely to get a unique combination. Once deployed at\nyour registrar, your assigned ninjas stand watch over your website\nkeeping it safe and ensuring it performs as fast as possible. We had a\nreally talented artist (Alaric Holloway) draw all the ninjas. Links to\ntheir full profiles will be online soon. In the meantime, I wanted to\nintroduce: Igor, Alex, Phil, Isla, and Vera.</p>\n<p>A full album of all our ninjas can be found on our <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Cloudflare\" title=\"Cloudflare&apos;s Facebook Page\">Facebook\npage</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Introducing Igor, Alex, Phil, Isla, and Vera: Five of Our Ninja\nNameservers\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/Vera.png.scaled.500.jpg\" title=\"Introducing Igor, Alex, Phil, Isla, and Vera: Five of Our Ninja Nameservers\"><noscript><img alt=\"Introducing Igor, Alex, Phil, Isla, and Vera: Five of Our Ninja\nNameservers\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/Vera.png.scaled.500.jpg\" title=\"Introducing Igor, Alex, Phil, Isla, and Vera: Five of Our Ninja Nameservers\"></noscript></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
