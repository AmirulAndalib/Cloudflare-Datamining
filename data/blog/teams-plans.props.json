		"html": "<p>We launched Cloudflare for Teams to make Zero Trust security accessible for all organizations, regardless of size, scale, or resources. Starting today, we are excited to take another step on this journey by announcing our new Teams plans, and more specifically, our Cloudflare for Teams Free plan, which protects up to 50 users at no cost. To get started, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/\">sign up</a> today.</p><p>If you’re interested in how and why we’re doing this, keep scrolling.</p><h3>Our Approach to Zero Trust</h3><p>Cloudflare Access is one-half of Cloudflare for Teams - a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/\">Zero Trust solution</a> that secures <b>inbound</b> connections to your protected applications. Cloudflare Access works like a bouncer, checking identity at the door to all of your applications.</p><p>The other half of Cloudflare for Teams is Cloudflare Gateway which, as our clever name implies, is a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/\">Secure Web Gateway</a> protecting all of your users’ <b>outbound</b> connections to the Internet. To continue with this analogy, Cloudflare Gateway is your organization’s bodyguard, securing your users as they navigate the Internet.</p><p>Together, these two solutions provide a powerful, single dashboard to protect your users, networks, and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/\">applications</a> from malicious actors.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/iDRsEvNVa9usUQpft7LXn/24f19e75f31916e058f476f2014eb22d/image1-teams-for-all-thumb-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1854\" height=\"1059\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>A Mission-Driven Solution</h3><p>At Cloudflare, our mission is to help build a better Internet. That means a better Internet for everyone, regardless of size, scale, or resources. With Cloudflare for Teams, our part in this mission is to keep your team members secure from unknown threats and your applications safe from attack, so that your team can focus on your business.</p><p>Earlier this year, shortly after we launched Cloudflare for Teams, organizations suddenly had to change the way they worked. Users left offices, and the security provided by those offices, to work from home. This accelerated the pace of IT transformation from years to days, or even hours.</p><p>To alleviate that burden, we provided Cloudflare for Teams for everyone at no cost, and with no restrictions until September 1, 2020. We also offered free one-on-one onboarding to make adoption seamless, and used those sessions to improve the product for our current users as well.</p><p>Moving forward, users will continue to work from home, and applications will continue to move away from managed data centers. While our initial free program is no longer available, our team wanted to find a new way to continue helping organizations of any size adjust to this new security model that seems to be here to stay.</p><h3>The New Free Plan</h3><p>Today, we are launching the Cloudflare for Teams Free plan, which brings the features of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/zero-trust-network-access/\">enterprise Zero Trust products</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/gateway/\">Secure Web Gateways</a> to small teams as well.</p><p>Cloudflare for Teams Free offers robust <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust security features</a> for both internal and SaaS applications, and supports integration with a myriad of social and enterprise identity providers like AzureAD or Github. Our Free plan also includes DNS content and security filtering for multiple network locations, complete with 24 hour log retention. By offering Cloudflare for Teams Free, our goal is to empower you to take your first step on a journey to Zero Trust with us.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4TXIxepmta09TZKNejOWUV/570e99e7a9bf363939b7584c098f3051/image2-10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1236\" height=\"946\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>What You Can Do with Teams Free</h3><p>With up to 50 seats of Access and Gateway, we’ve seen that the possibilities are endless. In fact, here are some of our favorite ways users are already getting the most out of Cloudflare for Teams Free today.</p><ul><li><p><b>Collaborate on your startup.</b> Build your product without worrying about security. Use Access to protect your development environment.</p></li><li><p><b>Secure your home Wi-Fi network.</b> Point your home Wi-Fi router’s traffic to Gateway, and set up simple filtering rules to block malware and phishing attacks.</p></li><li><p><b>Protect the backend of your personal website.</b> <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/how-to-improve-wordpress-security/\">Lock down</a> your WordPress admin panel pages, and invite collaborators to work on your blog by using Access’ one-time-pin feature.</p></li><li><p><b>Safeguard a guest Wi-Fi network.</b> Shield a retail location with Gateway by enforcing your Acceptable Use Policy on your network.</p></li></ul><h3>Standalone and Standard</h3><p>In addition to our new Cloudflare for Teams Free plan, we’re also making it easier to continue your Zero Trust journey by offering enhanced features in our standalone Cloudflare Access or Cloudflare Gateway plans.</p><p>With standalone Access, you can easily scale up or down with as many users as you need at any time for $3 per user.</p><p>Similarly, with Gateway standalone, you can safely and securely deploy DNS or HTTP security controls from 1 up to 20 different locations for $5 per user without compromising on reliability or performance.</p><p>Last but not least, we’re excited to finally give users a way to bundle with Teams Standard, which brings together everything from Access and Gateway under one simple plan at $7 per user.</p><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>To get started, just navigate to our <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/teams\">sign-up page</a> and create an account. If you already have an active account, you can head straight to the <a href=\"https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/onboarding\">Cloudflare for Teams dashboard</a>, where you’ll be dropped directly into our self-guided <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/access/getting-started/access-setup/\">onboarding</a> flow. From here, you&#39;re just three steps away from deploying Access or Gateway but, in our opinion, you can’t go wrong kicking off with either.</p>",
