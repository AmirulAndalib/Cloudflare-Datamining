	<p>On Friday, March 9, Iâ€™m <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2018/events/PP78776">moderating a panel</a> with Emily Schechter from Google, Aaron DeVera from Deloitte and Gabe Kassel from eero about how Wi-Fi networks work and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy"><strong>WEP</strong></a> happens when attackers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_over_Coax"><strong>coax</strong></a> people into joining insecure networks. Itâ€™s at Salon K in the Hilton at 3:30PM.</p>
	<p>On Sunday the 11th, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/author/nitin-rao">Nitin Rao</a> is <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2018/events/PP78457">on a panel</a> with Heather West from Mozilla, Stefan Lederer from Bitmovin and Fred Benenson from Unlimited Liability Corporation LLC about the impact of the recent revocation of Net Neutrality rules on online video streaming.

Nitin is really good at putting concepts in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU"><strong>GNU</strong></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"><strong>frame</strong></a>, so I expect this to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate"><strong>bit (g)rate</strong></a>. <a href="http://www.linfo.org/whoami.html"><strong>Whoami</strong></a> kidding?

(The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain"><strong>TLD</strong></a>(r) is that itâ€™s a long road ahead, but automotive companies are driven to make it better). Itâ€™s at 11am in Room 203-204 at the JW Marriot. He gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_0c9R4Fng">similar talk at Defcon</a> so this is kind of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"><strong>SQL</strong></a>.</p>

	</p>
	<p><em>Youâ€™re sitting at the gate, about to connect to the free airport Wi-Fi when you stop and think. Youâ€™ve heard something about insecure public Wi-Fi before, but could using a bad Wi-Fi network really leak your data or let someone hack your Facebook? Just as there will never be perfect code, there will always be inherent flaws in the tools we use to communicate, work and pay our bills. Find out how vulnerabilities in the web are exploited and what that means in the future of our online privacy.</em></p>

	</p>
	<p><em>As consumer demand for streaming video explodes, digital publishers are scrambling to upgrade their video production capabilities in the fight for viewer eyeballs. But in light of eroding net neutrality protections, publishers must ensure their streaming infrastructure delivers a stellar consumer experience in order to stay relevant and compete with giants like Netflix and YouTube. Hear from industry leaders on how the war on net neutrality will alter how audiences consume video.</em></p>

	</p>
	<p><em>A few years back, I hacked the Tesla Model S. Scary, right? Actually, itâ€™s not as scary as it seems. In this session, Iâ€™ll discuss the current state of automotive security as I see it and give a deep dive discussion on where security needs to be moving forward. Iâ€™ll discuss the steps needed to hack a car, the cars that are most vulnerable, the security of self-driving cars, and how concerned consumers can protect themselves.</em></p>
