	<p>The United States ban on TikTok went into effect on January 19, 2025, and our data showed a clear impact starting after 03:30 UTC (10:30 PM ET on January 18, 2025). The ban was part of the "<a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/plaws/publ50/PLAW-118publ50.pdf"><u>Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</u></a>," proposed in Congress, which ordered ByteDance to divest due to alleged security concerns. The bill was signed into law by Congress and President Biden in April 2024, and was upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
	<p>Aggregated data from our <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns"><u>1.1.1.1 DNS resolver</u></a> shows — as we’ve posted <a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1880890502364672216"><u>on X</u></a> — that the TikTok shutdown in the US began to impact DNS traffic to TikTok-related domains on January 19, just after 03:30 UTC (22:30 ET on January 18). This includes DNS traffic not only for TikTok, but also for other ByteDance-owned platforms, such as the CapCut video editor. Traffic dropped by as much as 85% compared to the previous week and showed signs of further decline in the following hours.</p>

	<p>Those trends are consistent with apps like RedNote rising on top of the Android and iOS App Stores, according to <a href="http://data.ai"><u>Data.ai</u></a>.</p>
	<p>President-elect Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-likely-give-tiktok-90-day-extension-avoid-ban-rcna188258"><u>indicated</u></a> on January 18 that he plans to grant TikTok a 90-day extension following his inauguration on Monday, January 20, 2025.</p>
	<p>We will continue monitoring the TikTok ban and share updates through a new blog post or on <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar"><u>@CloudflareRadar</u></a> (X), <a href="https://noc.social/@cloudflareradar"><u>noc.social/@cloudflareradar</u></a> (Mastodon), and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radar.cloudflare.com"><u>radar.cloudflare.com</u></a> (Bluesky).</p>

	</p>
	<p>On Sunday, January 19, 2025, around 17:30 UTC (12:30 ET), after 14 hours of the shutdown, TikTok announced it was beginning service restoration following assurances from Donald Trump. DNS traffic began to recover slightly after 18:00 but remained near "shutdown" levels for several hours, with traffic from AS396986 (ByteDance) showing a similar trend.</p>
	<p>As of Monday, January 20, 2025, TikTok-related domains in the U.S. remain below pre-shutdown levels. Despite some fluctuations overnight, DNS traffic to those domains has been recovering and at 17:00 UTC (11:00 AM ET) is already only 14% lower than the same time last week.</p>
