Together with Microsoft, we have supported thousands of customers including many of the largest Fortune 500 companies on their Zero Trust journey, enabling customers to simply and easily support their security needs with faster performance.</p><p>Cloudflare has built deep integrations with Microsoft to help organizations take the next step in their Zero Trust journey. These integrations empower organizations to make customer implementations operationally efficient while delivering a seamless user experience. Currently, all our mutual customers benefit from <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/microsoft/\">several integrations</a> across Microsoft 365 and Azure to secure web applications and safeguard employees with identity and device protections. Working with Microsoft has been critical in helping our customers on their Zero Trust journey. It is a complex undertaking that Cloudflare has been simplifying through our extremely easy to adopt product portfolio such as Cloudflare One via a  <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/cloudflare-vs-zscaler/#:~:text=Pick%20an%20architecture%20designed%20for%20the%20future%20of%20networking\">single pane of glass</a>.</p><p>We want to thank Microsoft for its continued collaboration with Cloudflare.
