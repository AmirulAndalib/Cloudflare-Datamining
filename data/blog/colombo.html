	<p>Six million Internet properties using Cloudflare are now even faster across the island country of Sri Lanka. Previously, local visitors to Cloudflare customers were served out of our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-singapore-data-center-now-online">Singapore</a> or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/middle-east-expansion">Dubai</a> data centers.<br></p>

	<p>Sri Lanka added over one million Internet users in the past year alone. At ~30% Internet penetration, there is considerable room to grow.</p>
