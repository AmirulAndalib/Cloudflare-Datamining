These cable cuts <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/houthi-internet-cables-ship-anchor-path/#:~:text=impacted%20countries%20in%20East%20Africa\">reportedly</a> impacted countries in East Africa, including <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/tz?dateStart=2024-02-22&amp;dateEnd=2024-02-28\">Tanzania</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ke?dateStart=2024-02-22&amp;dateEnd=2024-02-28\">Kenya</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ug?dateStart=2024-02-22&amp;dateEnd=2024-02-28\">Uganda</a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mz?dateStart=2024-02-22&amp;dateEnd=2024-02-28\">Mozambique</a>. As of this writing (May 13), <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-07/repairs-to-damaged-red-sea-internet-cables-delayed-by-yemen-political-splits\">these cables remain unrepaired</a>. </p><p>Already suffering from reduced capacity due to the February cable cuts, these countries were impacted by a second set of cable cuts that occurred on Sunday, May 12. According to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benliquidkenya/status/1789622798907843058\">social media post from Ben Roberts</a>, Group CTIO at Liquid Intelligent Technologies in Kenya, faults on the <a href=\"https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/eastern-africa-submarine-system-eassy\">EASSy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/seacomtata-tgn-eurasia\">Seacom</a> cables again disrupted connectivity to East Africa, as he noted “<em>All sub sea capacity between East Africa and South Africa is down.</em>” A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cprg0yn8q81o\">BBC article</a> citing Roberts stated that the EASSy cable had been cut approximately 45km (28 miles) north of the South African port city of Durban. A subsequent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CA_Kenya/status/1790022989913727121\">press release issued by the Communications Authority of Kenya</a> stated that the cut had occurred at the Mtunzini teleport station (in South Africa). As seen in the map below, both the EASSy and Seacom cables land in Mtunzini.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"757\"><figcaption><em>Map of African undersea cables, April 2024.</em><span class=\"-mobiledoc-kit__atom\">‌ ‌</span><em>Source: https://manypossibilities.net/african-undersea-cables/</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"impacts-to-country-level-internet-traffic\">Impacts to country-level Internet traffic</h2><p>Cloudflare Radar saw traffic levels across a number of the impacted countries drop just before 11:00 local time (08:00 UTC).  As seen in the graphs below, the magnitude of impact varied by country, with traffic initially dropping by 10-25% in <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ke?dateStart=2024-05-12\">Kenya</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/ug?dateStart=2024-05-12\">Uganda</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mg?dateStart=2024-05-12\">Madagascar</a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mz?dateStart=2024-05-12\">Mozambique</a>, while traffic in <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/rw?dateStart=2024-05-12\">Rwanda</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/mw?dateStart=2024-05-12\">Malawi</a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/tz?dateStart=2024-05-12\">Tanzania</a> dropped by one-third or more as compared to the previous week.</p><p>In Kenya and Uganda, the overall impact appeared to be low, with traffic generally remaining just below expected levels in the day and a half following the cable faults. In the other countries, the overnight trough of the diurnal traffic patterns remained consistent with the previous week’s traffic levels, but otherwise traffic remains significantly lower than expected.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image5-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image3-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image2-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image4-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/05/image1-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\"></figure><h2 id=\"the-importance-of-redundancy\">The importance of redundancy</h2><p>In Kenya, the impact may have been nominal due to steps taken by providers like Safaricom and Airtel Kenya. In a May 12 social media post, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SafaricomPLC/status/1789672918437200266\">Safaricom noted</a> “<em>...We have since activated redundancy measures to minimise service interruption and keep you connected as we await the full restoration of the cable.</em>” In a subsequent social media post on May 13, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SafaricomPLC/status/1789992420836307292/photo/1\">Safaricom noted</a> “<em>Thanks to our redundancy plans and capacity investment across multiple undersea cables our services continue to be available, however some customers may experience slow connectivity and speeds.</em>” Similarly, a social media post from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AIRTEL_KE/status/1790097275970019693/photo/1\">Airtel Kenya noted</a> “<em>Following yesterday's undersea fiber cut that has impacted internet connectivity, we would like to update you that we have taken measures to improve your browsing experience through additional capacity enhancement.</em>”</p><p>Similarly, the previously referenced <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CA_Kenya/status/1790022989913727121/photo/1\">press release</a> from the Communications Authority of Kenya talked about actions being taken, stating “<em>Meanwhile, the Authority has directed service providers to take proactive steps to secure alternative routes for their traffic and is monitoring the situation closely to ensure that incoming and outbound internet connectivity is available. The East Africa Marine System (TEAMS) cable, which has not been affected by the cut, is currently being utilised for local traffic flow while redundancy on the South Africa route has been activated to minimize the impact.</em>”</p><h2 id=\"what%E2%80%99s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>Once the necessary permits are secured and the cable faults are located, repairs can often be completed in several days. However, because cable repair ships are <a href=\"https://www.iscpc.org/information/cableships-of-the-world/?items=0\">something of a scarce resource</a>, there is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea-deep-repair-ships\">often a delay</a> to both engage a vessel and for it to travel to the area where the cable damage occurred, whether from its baseport or the location of a previous repair. However, in this case that delay may be comparatively short, as submarine cable industry observer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philBE2/status/1790051184578871524\">@philBE2 predicts</a> “<em>Expecting the usual suspect, </em><a href=\"https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/8108676\"><em>CS Leon Thevenin</em></a><em>, now moored in Cape Town, to be swiftly mobilized for an expeditious repair mission…</em>”</p><p>The Cloudflare Radar team will continue to monitor traffic recovery and the status of Internet connectivity in the impacted countries.
