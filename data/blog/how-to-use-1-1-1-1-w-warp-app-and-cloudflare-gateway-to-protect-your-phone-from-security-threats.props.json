		"html": "<p><a href=\"https://teams.cloudflare.com/gateway/\">Cloudflare Gateway</a> protects users and devices from security threats, starting with your local network. We are bringing that same level of security to your mobile devices with the 1.1.1.1 w/ WARP app. Wherever your devices connect, they can block the same types of threats that Gateway keeps off your home or office WiFi.</p><p>The 1.1.1.1 w/ WARP app has secured millions of mobile Internet connections. When installed, 1.1.1.1 w/ WARP encrypts the traffic leaving your device, giving you a more private browsing experience. </p><p>You can get even more out of your 1.1.1.1 w/ WARP. By adding Cloudflare Gateway’s secure DNS filtering to the app, you can add a layer of security and block malicious domains flagged as phishing, command and control, or spam. This protection isn’t dependent on what network you’re connected to - it follows you everywhere you go.</p><p>The feature is rolling out to both the iOS and Android clients this week. You do not need to install a different app; as the release is available, you will be able to upgrade your version and follow the steps below for a safer Internet on any network.</p><h3 id=\"download-the-1-1-1-1-w-warp-mobile-app\">Download the 1.1.1.1 w/ WARP mobile app</h3><p>If you don’t have the latest version of the 1.1.1.1 w/ WARP app go to the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627\">Apple App Store</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone\">Google Play Store</a> to download the latest version.</p><h3 id=\"sign-up-for-cloudflare-gateway\">Sign up for Cloudflare Gateway</h3><p><a href=\"https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com\">Sign up for Cloudflare Gateway</a> by visiting the Cloudflare for Teams dashboard.
