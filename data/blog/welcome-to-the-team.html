	<p>We have a new face around Cloudflare. Damon Billian came on-board in<br>
		early September and is here to focus on the Cloudflare community. We<br>
		believe in building a strong community since one of the powerful things<br>
		about Cloudflare is that with every new site on the system, the system<br>
		gets smarter.</p>
	<p>Damon has a ton of experience creating vibrant communities. He was the<br>
		first community manager at PayPal, including living through the eBay<br>
		acquisition. More recently he evangalized for SimplyHired and Mint.com<br>
		(including taking them through their launch at TechCrunch40). Having a<br>
		community that works together to identify new threats as they arise is<br>
		critical for Cloudflare and we couldn't be more thrilled to have someone with his background joining our team.</p>
	<p>You will see Damon in the Cloudflare <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com">Knowledge Base</a> and on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/cloudflare">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cloudflare">Facebook</a> too.</p>
	<p>Damon has an infectious energy, so we are excited to have him on-board. We know you will be too!</p>
