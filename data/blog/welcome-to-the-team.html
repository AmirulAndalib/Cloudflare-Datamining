	<p>We have a new face around Cloudflare. Damon Billian came on-board inearly September and is here to focus on the Cloudflare community. Webelieve in building a strong community since one of the powerful thingsabout Cloudflare is that with every new site on the system, the systemgets smarter.</p>
	<p>Damon has a ton of experience creating vibrant communities. He was thefirst community manager at PayPal, including living through the eBayacquisition. More recently he evangalized for SimplyHired and Mint.com(including taking them through their launch at TechCrunch40). Having acommunity that works together to identify new threats as they arise iscritical for Cloudflare and we couldn't be more thrilled to have someone with his background joining our team.</p>
	<p>You will see Damon in the Cloudflare <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com">Knowledge Base</a> and on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/cloudflare">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cloudflare">Facebook</a> too.</p>
