	<p>Cloudflare is a service that takes a great deal of pride in listening to the feedback of our users. Cloudflare recently had a customer make a <a href="https://cloudflare.tenderapp.com/discussions/problems/1048-wordpress-multisite">very strong case</a> that we build a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins">WordPress plugin</a> for CloudFlare, something we were considering asking a developer to build, but the customer convinced us to build our own. Within a few weeks, Ian built our first iteration of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cloudflare">CloudFlare WordPress plugin</a> that is now live.</p>
