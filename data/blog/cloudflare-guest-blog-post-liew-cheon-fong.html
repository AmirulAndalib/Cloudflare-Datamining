	<p><em>Liew Cheon Fong (a.k.a LiewCF) is a full-time <a href="http://www.riceblogger.com/top-100-malaysian-blogs">tech blogger from Malaysia</a> writing about tech news, tech tips and gadget reviews at: <a href="http://www.liewcf.com">www.liewcf.com</a></em></p>
	<p>My blog (<a href="http://liewcf.com">http://liewcf.com</a>) was frequently coming under heavy server
		load because of malicious traffic. The malicious traffic to my blog
		frequently brought down my dedicated server, with a server load pushing
		up to 100 CPU. While my hosting company worked very hard to keep the
		server online, even their 24/7 server monitoring only helped reduce the
		downtime associated with malicious traffic.</p>
	<p>I was looking for help with my blog and was thinking about migrating my
		blog to a high-end secured web hosting company. Given the hassles of
		migrating hosting providers - not to mention the fact that I would
		likely be paying higher monthly fees for hosting - I was frantically
		looking for an alternative that would help my site stay up when my
		server went down. A friend of mine advised me that I should try
		<a href="https://cloudflare.com">CloudFlare</a>, a relatively new service that could
		help mitigate problems with malicious traffic and other service outages.
		After doing a bit of research about CloudFlare on Google, I decided to
		create an account to see if that would help me with my problems.
	</p>
	<p>Setting up CloudFlare was an easy process, one that took about five
		minutes for me to switch my authoritative name servers over to
		CloudFlare, and switching over the name servers would be a far easier
		task than migrating to a different hosting provider. If I wasn't happy
		with CloudFlare, it would only take me a few minutes to switch the name
		servers back to my original registrar. Much to my surprise, my server
		load dropped rapidly and I was no longer seeing the effects of the
		attacks on my server.</p>
	<p>In addition to the free security protection that CloudFlare offers,
		CloudFlare also works like a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/) to cache
		your website static content and speed up the page load time. I
		personally decided to upgrade to the
		<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans.html">Pro</a> account to take advantage
		of the more advanced security functions, which was important to me
		because of the frequent attacks, and because the more advanced caching
		with the <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22263581-What-does-the-Website-Preloader-do-">website preloader</a>
		helps make my pages load even faster.
	</p>
	<p>My CloudFlare dashboard has revealed the following benefits to me as a
		blogger:</p>
	<p>-My page loads are approximately 73% faster (.38 seconds after
		installing CloudFlare, 1.43 seconds before installing CloudFlare).
		CloudFlare calculates the speed by sending the same request twice: once
		through the CloudFlare system, and once directly to your site, bypassing
		the CloudFlare system)<br>
		-CloudFlare is saving me about 38% on my bandwidth costs.</p>
	<p>I highly recommend CloudFlare to any site that is suffering a high
		server load or that has issues with malicious traffic. You can get
		started with a free CloudFlare account (yes, it is FREE!) to reduce
		server load, increase page load time, and get protected! In a nutshell,
		if you need a free (or paid) service to protect your website and
		increase site performance, try CloudFlare.</p>
	<p>Notes:
		- You can only modify your name servers settings if you own your own
		domain name. <br>
		- You will have to switch your name servers to CloudFlare to get their
		protection and CDN services.<br>
		- Doing a dig or checking whois would reflect CloudFlare's name servers.<br>
		- CloudFlare, much like any other rapidly growing startup, has had some
		growing pains and is not entirely problem free. But they always solve
		problems promptly and are continuously improving the system. CloudFlare
		support has been highly responsive via both <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/help.html">CloudFlare
			help</a> or
		<a href="https://twitter.com/cloudflare">Twitter</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Disclosure: While I did receive a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inaugural-cloudflare-t-shirts">CloudFlare
			t-shir</a>t
		shortly after subscribing to CloudFlare , I did not receive any
		compensation to write this article.</p>
