The CloudFlare team is excited to meet our current partners and potential new partners at the show.</p>\n<p>CloudFlare has been working with a terrific group of hosting providers to build the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners.html\">CloudFlare Certified Hosting Provider </a>program. There are many benefits to being a CloudFlare Certified hosting partner. Here is what some of our partners have been saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Since we've signed up to CloudFlare, there's been a decrease of bandwidth usage in our overall network, and server load has been significantly reduced as well. The service has provided additional security to our entire network.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&quot;This is a game changer that brings CDN services to our customers through the click of a button. Faster site loads, a geographically diverse CDN, added security and simplicity. What's not to like?&quot;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Since signing up for CloudFlare, we've seen an increase in our sales.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our team will be at HostingCon to meet our current partners and potential new partners. We have several fun events planned including <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/limo.html\">complimentary limousine service</a> between San Diego Airport and the Hilton Bayfront, a hosted breakfast each morning at the conference and our exhibit booth.</p>\n<p>In addition, our co-founder and CEO, <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/people.html\">Matthew Prince</a>, will be giving a talk on Monday, August 8 at 3pm in Room 31BC titled:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Outsourcing for Hosters - How Third Party Services Can Save you Money and Improve Performance&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Be sure to attend the session to learn how to get more ROI out of your<br>\nexisting infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CloudFlare is exhibit booth #235. If you are already one of our certified hosting provider partners, be sure to stop by and introduce yourself. We will have CloudFlare tshirts and other goodies. If you are not a partner yet, stop by to learn more about how CloudFlare can save you server and bandwidth resources, provide DDOS protection and IPv6 compatibility.</p>\n<p>See you in San Diego!</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/limo.html\">limousine service here</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners.html\">CloudFlare Certified Hosting Provider</a> program</li>\n</ul>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
