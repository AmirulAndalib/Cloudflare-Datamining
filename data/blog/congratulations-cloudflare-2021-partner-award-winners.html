	<p>Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the winners of our annual Channel and Alliance Partner Awards for 2021. Throughout a year of continued global disruptions, Cloudflareâ€™s partners kept innovating, expanding their solutions and services capabilities, and accelerated their growth with us and our platform. It is important that we recognize and award the partners of ours who stood out in staying laser-focused on delivering outstanding business outcomes for customers.</p>

	<p>With the ongoing shift in 2021 to remote, flexible work forces and the evolving cyber threat landscape, more than ever organizations across every industry and the public sector were looking to Cloudflare, and to work hand in hand with partners who can deliver a modern, Zero Trust approach to security. Seeing this consistent need, we are continuing to build and support new levels of partner-led growth in the year ahead such as with a new partner services program for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase">SASE</a> and Zero Trust which we launched at the start of 2022.</p>
	<p>Please join us in congratulating the impressive achievements of our partner award winners over this past year! They enable the further delivery of Internet security, performance, and reliability for organizations of all sizes and types â€” and we are thrilled to be recognizing their impact.</p>
