	<p>Six oâ€™clock already, I was just in the middle of a dream, now Iâ€™m up, awake, looking at my Twitter stream. As I do that the Twitter app is making multiple API calls over HTTPS to Twitterâ€™s servers somewhere on the Internet.</p>
	<p>Those HTTPS connections are running over TCP via my home WiFi and broadband connection. Allâ€™s well inside the house, the WiFi connection is interference free thanks to my eero system, the broadband connection is stable and so thereâ€™s no packet loss, and my broadband providerâ€™s connection to Twitterâ€™s servers is also loss free.</p>

	<p></p>
	<p>Those are the perfect conditions for HTTPS running over TCP. Not a packet dropped, not a bit of jitter, no congestion. Itâ€™s even the perfect conditions for HTTP/2 where multiple streams of requests and responses are being sent from my phone to websites and APIs as I boot my morning. Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection for multiple, simultaneously in flight requests. That has a significant speed advantage over the old way (one request after another per TCP connection) when conditions are good.</p>
	<p>But I have to catch an early train, got to be to work by nine, so I step out of the front door and my phone silently and smoothly switches from my home WiFi to 4G. Allâ€™s not well inside the phoneâ€™s apps though. The TCP connections in use between Chrome and apps, and websites and APIs are suddenly silent. Those HTTPS connections are in trouble and about to fail; errors are going to occur deep inside apps. Iâ€™m going to see sluggish response from my phone.</p>

	<p>The IP address associated with my phone has abruptly changed as I go from home to roam. TCP connections either stall or get dropped resulting in a weird delay while internal timers inform apps that connections have disappeared or as connections are re-established. Itâ€™s irritating, because it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear, and now Iâ€™m waiting for an app that worked fine moments ago.</p>
	<p>The same thing will happen multiple times on my trip as I jump around the cell towers and service providers along the route. It might be tempting to blame it on the train, but itâ€™s really that the Internet was never meant to work this way. We werenâ€™t meant to be carrying around pocket supercomputers that roam across lossy, noisy networks all the while trying to remain productive while complaining about sub-second delays in app response time.</p>

	<p>One proposed solution to these problems is QUIC: a new way to send packets across the Internet that takes into account what a messy place the Internet really is. A place where people donâ€™t stand still and use the same IP address all the time (the horror!), a place where packets get lost because of radio reflections off concrete buildings (how awful!), a place with no Waze (how terrible!) where congestion comes and goes without a live map. </p>
	<p>QUIC tries to make an HTTPS connection between a computer (phone) and server work reliably despite the poor conditions, it does this with a collection of technologies.</p>
	<p>The first is UDP to replace TCP. UDP is widely used for fire-and-forget protocols where packets are sent but their arrival or ordering is not guaranteed (TCP provides the opposite: it guarantees arrival order and delivery but at a cost). Because UDP doesnâ€™t have TCPâ€™s guarantees it allows developers to innovate new protocols that do guarantee delivery and ordering (on top of UDP) that can incorporate features that TCP lacks.</p>
	<p>One such feature is end-to-end encryption. All QUIC connections are fully encrypted. Another proposed feature is forward-error correction or FEC. When NASAâ€™s Deep Space Network talks to the Voyager 2 spacecraft (which recently left our solar system) it transmits messages that become garbled crossing 17.6 billion km of space (thatâ€™s about 11 billion miles). Voyager 2 canâ€™t send back the equivalent of â€œSay again?â€ when it receives a garbled message so the messages sent to Voyager 2 contain error-correcting codes that allow it to reconstruct the message from the mess.</p>
	<p>Similarly, QUIC plans to incorporate error-correcting codes that allow missing data to be reconstructed. Although an app or server can send the â€œSay again?â€ message, itâ€™s faster if an error-correcting code stops that being needed. The result is snappy apps and websites even in difficult Internet conditions.</p>
	<p>QUIC also solves the HTTP/2 HoL problem. HoL is head of line blocking: because HTTP/2 sits on top of TCP and TCP guarantees delivery order if a packet gets lost the entire TCP connection has to wait while the missing packet is retransmitted. Thatâ€™s OK if only one stream of data is passing over the TCP connection, but for efficiency itâ€™s better to have multiple streams per connection. Sadly that means all streams wait when a packet gets lost. QUIC solves that because it doesnâ€™t rely on TCP for delivery and ordering and can make an intelligent decision about which streams need to wait and which can continue when a packet goes astray.</p>
	<p>Finally, one of the slower parts of a standard HTTP/2 over TCP connection is the very beginning. When the app or browser makes a connection thereâ€™s an initial handshake at the TCP level followed by a handshake to establish encryption. Over a high latency connection (say on a mobile phone on 3G) that creates a noticeable delay. Since QUIC controls all aspects of the connect it merges together connection and encryption into a single handshake.</p>
