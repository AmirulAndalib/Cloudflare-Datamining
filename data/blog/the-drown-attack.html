	<p>We publish our SSL configuration <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/sslconfig">here</a> so that others can use it. We currently accept TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.</p>
	<p>We are proactively testing our customers' origin web servers to detect vulnerable servers and will be reaching out to any that have a server that is <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl">vulnerable to DROWN</a>.</p>
	<p>In the interim, ensure that SSLv2 is fully disabled and/or that private keys are not shared with servers that still need to have SSLv2.</p>
