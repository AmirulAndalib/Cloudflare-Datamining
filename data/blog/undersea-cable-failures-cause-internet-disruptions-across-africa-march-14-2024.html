	<p>Internet connectivity in several African countries was disrupted today, March 14, 2024. Beginning at approximately 05:00 UTC, west and central African countries were most impacted, as was South Africa. Based on published reports and social media posts from impacted network providers, the disruption is believed to be due to multiple undersea cable failures in the region. From The Gambia to Côte d'Ivoire, including a major network in South Africa (Vodacom), a total of 13 African countries were impacted, based on our observations.</p>
	<p><a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Radar</a> data shows a pattern of disruptions from the north to the south of West Africa over time. It began south of Senegal, with The Gambia, Guinea, and Liberia experiencing disruptions around 05:00 UTC.</p>

	<h3>The importance of submarine cables</h3>
	<p>This series of disruptions serves as a reminder of how dependent the Internet is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable">submarine cables</a>, which are estimated to carry over <a href="https://blog.telegeography.com/2023-mythbusting-part-3">90% of intercontinental data traffic</a>. Only a small percentage of general use is done via satellite networks. There are <a href="https://submarine-cable-map-2023.telegeography.com">529 active submarine cables and 1,444 landings</a> that are currently active or under construction, running to an estimated 1.3 million km around the globe.</p>
	<p>We have written about submarine cable-related outages before, from <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-is-back-in-tonga-after-38-days-of-outage">Tonga</a> to the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts">AAE-1 &amp; SMW5 cable cuts of June 2022</a>.</p>
	<p>Reports from several local networks, including South Africa’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Vodacom/status/1768262584413679758">Vodacom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MTN180/status/1768280785084137753">MTN</a> in Nigeria, and <a href="https://twitter.com/celtiisbj/status/1768276617967587731">Celtiis</a> in Bénin, reference multiple submarine cable failures. Microsoft was more detailed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240314160638/https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status">stating on their Azure status page</a> that “multiple fiber cables on the West Coast of Africa — WACS, MainOne, SAT3, ACE — have been impacted which reduced total capacity supporting our Regions in South Africa”. The company also explains that the recent cable cuts in the <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1762447960074330340?s=20">Red Sea</a> in combination with today’s cable issues, “has impacted all Africa capacity”.</p>
	<p>In addition to the impacts to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, the <a href="https://www.mainone.net">website of MainOne</a>, owners of the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/mainone">MainOne submarine cable</a>, was offline for several hours. DNS for mainone.net is handled by name servers located in MainOne’s address space. It appears that a portion of the IPv4 address space for AS37282 (MAINONE) stopped being announced between 07:30 and 15:00 UTC, and once this address space was being routed again, both the nameservers and website became reachable.</p>

	<p>The disruptions are now being reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/internet-disruption-hits-west-central-africa-netblocks-cloudflare-data-shows-2024-03-14">news media outlets</a>, including in <a href="https://subtelforum.com/south-africa-internet-hit-by-multiple-subsea-cable-breaks">South Africa</a>, where the emphasis is not only on the latest outage but also on the problem with the submarine cable operator <a href="https://www.itweb.co.za/article/seacom-confirms-cable-outage-in-red-sea/KPNG8v8NyDNM4mwD">Seacom</a>. This operator experienced a service-impacting outage on its cable system in the Red Sea. On March 8, the company <a href="https://www.itweb.co.za/article/seacom-waits-for-permits-to-start-red-sea-cable-repairs/xA9POvNEyapqo4J8">stated</a> that it is waiting for <a href="https://subtelforum.com/seacom-waits-for-permits-to-start-red-sea-cable-repairs">permits</a> to start repairing its broken submarine cable in the Red Sea.</p>
