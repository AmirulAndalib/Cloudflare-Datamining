	"description": "Today is Groundhog Day: the day on which a groundhog (named Phil) crawls out of his hole in Punxsutawney, PA and either sees his shadow, meaning we&#x27;re in for six more weeks of winter, or does not, in which case it will be an early spring. Phil&#x27;s official keeper is the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. "
