	<p>In early 2016, Cloudflare opened an engineering office in Champaign, IL to build <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/argo">Argo Smart Routing</a>. Champaign's proximity to the University of Illinois, one of the nation's top engineering schools, makes it an attractive place for high-tech companies to set up shop and for talented engineers to call home. Since graduating from UIUC in 2008, I've had opportunities to work on amazing software projects, growing technically and as a leader, all while enjoying the lifestyle benefits of Champaign (15 minute commute, anyone?).</p>
	<p>Cloudflare has attended annual recruiting events at UIUC since the Champaign office was opened. This year, we've started to expand our search to other top engineering schools in the midwest. In the fall semester we attended a career fair at UW-Madison. We were impressed with the caliber of talent we saw which made it an easy decision to return. Our hope is to show students studying at universities in the midwest the opportunity to build a career right here, working on compelling projects like Argo.</p>
