Just after\nmidnight last night in Cairo virtually all traffic coming from the\ncountry stopped dead. Throughout the day today there has only been a\ntrickle of visitors from Egypt to our network. It goes to show what a\npowerful and important force the Internet is, and yet how fragile our\naccess to it can be. The thoughts of the CloudFlare team are with the\ncitizens of Egypt. We&apos;re all hoping for a swift and peaceful end to the\nconflict and that we start seeing Egyptian visitors to our network and\nthe rest of the web again very soon.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
