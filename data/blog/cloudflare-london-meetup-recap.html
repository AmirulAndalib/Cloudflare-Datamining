	<p>Cloudflare helps make over 6 million websites faster and more secure. In doing so, Cloudflare has a vast and diverse community of users throughout the world. Whether discussing Cloudflare on social media, browsing our community forums or following Pull Requests on our open-source projects; there is no shortage of lively discussions amongst Cloudflare users. Occasionally, however, it is important to move these discussions out from cyberspace and take time to connect in person.</p>
	<p>A little while ago, we did exactly this and ran a meetup in the Cloudflare London office. Ivan Rustic from Hardenize was our guest speaker, he demonstrated how Hardenize developed a Cloudflare App to help build a culture of security. I presented two other talks which included a primer on how the Cloudflare network is architected and wrapped up with a discussion on how you can build and monetise your very own Cloudflare App.</p>
	<p>Since we presented this meet-up, I've received a few requests to share the videos of all the talks. You can find all three of the talks from our last London office meet-up in this blog post.</p>
