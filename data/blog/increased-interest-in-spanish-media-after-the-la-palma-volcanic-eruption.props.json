And with <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> (our Internet trends and insights free tool for everyone — including journalists, like I was for several years) you get a sense of different trends in the collection of networks that form the Internet.</p><p>We saw that over the past week or so in Spain. Radar shows a clear increase in interest in Spanish media outlets (in comparison with the preceding days and Sundays) after the news of the eruption in La Palma (one of the Spanish Canary Islands) broke on Sunday, September 19.</p><p>That is particularly clear looking at El País, one of the most well known media outlets in the country. Using our <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/domain/elpais.com\">Global Popularity Ranking Trend</a> available on Radar, we can see that ElPais.com jumped several positions in our ranking of most popular domains after September 19. That change is clear in the last seven days, but especially in the last 30, putting El País near the top 3,000 most popular domains in the world.</p><h3 id=\"elpais-com\">Elpais.com</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/09/image1-46.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The increase in El País’s traffic is clearly visible after Sunday, September 19, 2021\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>The increase in El País’s popularity is clearly visible after Sunday, September 19, 2021</figcaption></figure><p>A similar trend is seen on the El Mundo website, which had its highest days of global popularity on Wednesday and Thursday of last week.
