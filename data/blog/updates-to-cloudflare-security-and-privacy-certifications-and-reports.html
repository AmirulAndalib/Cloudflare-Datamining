	<p>Cloudflare’s products and services are protecting more customers than ever with significant expansion over the past year. Earlier this week, we launched Cloudflare Security Center so customers can map their attack surface, review potential security risks and threats to their organization, and have generally fast tracked many offerings to meet the needs of customers.</p>
	<p>This rapid expansion has meant ensuring our security, privacy, and risk posture grew accordingly. Customer confidence in our ability to handle their sensitive information in an ever-changing regulatory landscape has to be as solid as our offerings, so we have expanded the scope of our previously-existing compliance validations; not only that, we’ve also managed to obtain a couple of new ones.</p>
	<h3 id="what-s-new">What’s New</h3>
	<p>We’ve had a busy year and focused on our commitment to privacy as well as complying to one of the most rigorous security standards in the industry. We are excited about the following achievements in 2021:</p>

	<p>FedRAMP In Process - Cloudflare hit a major milestone by being listed on the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/product/cloudflare-federal?sort=productName" target="_blank">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> as ‘In Process’ for receiving an agency authorization at a moderate baseline. Once an Authorization to Operate (ATO) is granted, it will allow agencies and other cloud service providers to leverage our product and services in a public sector capacity.</p>
	<p>ISO 27701:2019 (International Organization for Standardization) - Cloudflare is one of the first companies in the industry to achieve ISO 27701 certification as both a data processor and controller. The certification provides assurance to our customers that we have a formal privacy program that is aligned to GDPR.</p>

	<h3 id="security-certifications-reports">Security Certifications &amp; Reports</h3>
	<p>Cloudflare understands the importance of maintaining compliance to industry standards, certifications, and reports.

Each year, the security team expands the scope of these validations to ensure that all of our applicable products and services are included. &nbsp;Cloudflare has met the requirements of the following standards:</p>

	<h3 id="what-s-on-our-roadmap">What’s on our Roadmap?</h3>
	<p>As a global company, Cloudflare partners with industry experts and regional leaders around the world to determine the best ways to build customer trust. Our infoshare events with existing customers and participation in standards organizations guide our methods to continuously improve the security and privacy posture of our products and services. Part of that improvement is obtaining additional third party validations. At this time, we are evaluating ISO 27018 to give customers additional assurance that we meet industry standards for handling personal data in our cloud platform. We will continue to move forward in our FedRAMP journey. And of course, we are continuously evaluating a range of other region-specific certifications.
