	<p>As many of you know, we have been working on Cloudflare for several
		months. We are excited to announce that today we closed our Series A
		financing from Venrock and UV Partners (now called Pelion Ventures). We
		believe outside investment from professionals will help us build the
		best service possible for our users. With the financing, we will hire
		additional rock-star engineers and get our private beta up and running.
		We will be inviting members of Project Honey Pot in waves to the
		Cloudflare private beta. If you want a beta invitation code, you can
		request one here: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/request-invite.html" target="_blank">https://www.cloudflare.com/request-invite.html</a> </p>
	<p>Here is a photo taken on finance closing day from Carmel, CA. Matthew,
		Lee &amp; I met for lunch in Carmel to start the product planning process
		(and to celebrate)!</p>
