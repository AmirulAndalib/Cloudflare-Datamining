With any sufficiently\ncomplex system, it is inevitable that unexpected problems will arise. It\nlooks like Tumblr is getting back on their feet, but nothing feels worse\nthan downtime.</p>\n<p>That&apos;s why one of my favorite CloudFlare features is &quot;Always Online.&quot;\nThink of it like insurance for your website. We use the natural pattern\nof search engine crawlers to build a cached copy of your site. If, for\nany reason, your web host or service provider goes down, we kick in to\nkeep your site online. We can&apos;t perform magic and make a dynamic site\nfully functional when its backend is down, so things like shopping carts\nand other web applications will still cause an error. However, your\nbasic content will stay up so your visitors can still find you and\nsearch engines will keep indexing you.</p>\n<p>Some of my favorite messages to get from customers read like the\nfollowing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<br<<p>Just wanted to let your team know how Cloudflare has saved our sales\n... Our site was offline most of the afternoon due too many\nconnections trying to connect at once ... but since our site was\ncached through CloudFlare&apos;s Always Online service it stayed available\nand customers still made it to us. If it was not for CloudFlare we\nwould have missed sales. Thank you CloudFlare for keeping our business\nonline and our sales coming when even our site is down!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br><p>That&apos;s pretty cool.</p>\n<p>While anyone with their own domain can sign up for CloudFlare today,\nwe&apos;re talking with several platform providers to bring the insurance of\nAlways Online, and the other benefits CloudFlare offers, to even more\nsites. Our goal is simple: to make outages like the one Tumblr just\nlived through a thing of the past.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
