This edition covers the DDoS threat landscape along with key findings as observed from the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network/\">Cloudflare network</a> during the first quarter of 2024.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-a-ddos-attack\">What is a DDoS attack?</h3><p>But first, a quick recap. A DDoS attack, short for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">Distributed Denial of Service attack</a>, is a type of cyber attack that aims to take down or disrupt Internet services such as websites or mobile apps and make them unavailable for users. DDoS attacks are usually done by flooding the victim's server with more traffic than it can handle.</p><p>To learn more about DDoS attacks and other types of attacks, visit our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/\">Learning Center</a>.</p><h3 id=\"accessing-previous-reports\">Accessing previous reports</h3><p>Quick reminder that you can access <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/ddos-reports\">previous editions of DDoS threat reports</a> on the Cloudflare blog.

Network-layer DDoS attacks, also known as L3/4 DDoS attacks, increased by 28% YoY and 5% QoQ.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/image1-15.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1630\" height=\"1232\"><figcaption>2024 Q1: Cloudflare mitigated 4.5 million DDoS attacks</figcaption></figure><p>When comparing the combined number of HTTP DDoS attacks and L3/4 DDoS attacks, we can see that, overall, in the first quarter of 2024, the count increased by 50% YoY and 18% QoQ.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--7--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"DDoS attacks by year and quarter\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"942\"><figcaption>DDoS attacks by year and quarter</figcaption></figure><p>In total, our systems mitigated 10.5 trillion HTTP DDoS attack requests in Q1. Our systems also mitigated over 59 petabytes of DDoS attack traffic — just on the network-layer.</p><p>Among those network-layer DDoS attacks, many of them exceeded the 1 terabit per second rate — almost on a weekly basis. The largest attack that we have mitigated so far in 2024 was launched by a Mirai-variant botnet. This attack reached 2 Tbps and was aimed at an Asian hosting provider protected by <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/\">Cloudflare Magic Transit</a>. Cloudflare’s systems automatically detected and mitigated the attack.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/?utm_campaign=thenet&utm_medium=blog\">\n  <img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/12/theNET_blog_1-1.png\" alt=\"theNET\">\n</a><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/\">Mirai botnet</a>, infamous for its massive DDoS attacks, was primarily composed of infected IoT devices. It notably disrupted Internet access across the US in 2016 by targeting DNS service providers. Almost eight years later, Mirai attacks are still very common. Four out of every 100 HTTP DDoS attacks, and two out of every 100 L3/4 DDoS attacks are launched by a Mirai-variant botnet. The reason we say “variant” is that the Mirai source code was made public, and over the years there have been many permutations of the original.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Mirai botnet targets Asian hosting provider with 2 Tbps DDoS attack\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"938\"><figcaption>Mirai botnet targets Asian hosting provider with 2 Tbps DDoS attack</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"dns-attacks-surge-by-80\">DNS attacks surge by 80%</h3><p>In March 2024, we introduced one of our latest DDoS defense systems, the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/advanced-dns-protection\">Advanced DNS Protection</a> system. This system complements our existing systems, and is designed to protect against the most sophisticated DNS-based DDoS attacks.</p><p>It is not out of the blue that we decided to invest in this new system. DNS-based DDoS attacks have become the most prominent attack vector and its share among all network-layer attacks continues to grow. In the first quarter of 2024, the share of DNS-based DDoS attacks increased by 80% YoY, growing to approximately 54%.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--1--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"DNS-based DDoS attacks by year and quarter\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"948\"><figcaption>DNS-based DDoS attacks by year and quarter</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the surge in DNS attacks and due to the overall increase in all types of DDoS attacks, the share of each attack type, remarkably, remains the same as seen in our previous report for the final quarter of 2023. HTTP DDoS attacks remain at 37% of all DDoS attacks, DNS DDoS attacks at 33%, and the remaining 30% is left for all other types of L3/4 attacks, such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/\">SYN Flood</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/udp-flood-ddos-attack/\">UDP Floods</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--2-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Attack type distribution\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"535\"><figcaption>Attack type distribution</figcaption></figure><p>And in fact, SYN Floods were the second most common L3/4 attack. The third was RST Floods, another type of TCP-based DDoS attack. UDP Floods came in fourth with a 6% share.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--3-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Top attack vectors\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"903\"><figcaption>Top attack vectors</figcaption></figure><p>When analyzing the most common attack vectors, we also check for the attack vectors that experienced the largest growth but didn’t necessarily make it into the top ten list. Among the top growing attack vectors (emerging threats), Jenkins Flood experienced the largest growth of over 826% QoQ.</p><p>Jenkins Flood is a DDoS attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the <a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/\">Jenkins automation server</a>, specifically through UDP multicast/broadcast and DNS multicast services. Attackers can send small, specially crafted requests to a publicly facing UDP port on Jenkins servers, causing them to respond with disproportionately large amounts of data. This can amplify the traffic volume significantly, overwhelming the target's network and leading to service disruption. Jenkins addressed this vulnerability (<a href=\"https://smartermsp.com/cybersecurity-threat-advisory-0013-20-jenkins-udp-ddos-attack-cve-2020-2100/\">CVE-2020-2100</a>) in 2020 by disabling these services by default in later versions. However, as we can see, even 4 years later, this vulnerability is still being abused in the wild to launch DDoS attacks.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--4-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Attack vectors that experienced the largest growth QoQ\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"903\"><figcaption>Attack vectors that experienced the largest growth QoQ</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"http2-continuation-flood\">HTTP/2 Continuation Flood</h3><p>Another attack vector that’s worth discussing is the HTTP/2 Continuation Flood. This attack vector is made possible by a vulnerability that was <a href=\"https://nowotarski.info/http2-continuation-flood-technical-details/\">discovered and reported publicly by researcher Bartek Nowotarski</a> on April 3, 2024.</p><p>The HTTP/2 Continuation Flood vulnerability targets HTTP/2 protocol implementations that improperly handle HEADERS and multiple CONTINUATION frames. The threat actor sends a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS flag, leading to potential server issues such as out-of-memory crashes or CPU exhaustion. HTTP/2 Continuation Flood allows even a single machine to disrupt websites and APIs using HTTP/2, with the added challenge of difficult detection due to no visible requests in HTTP access logs.</p><p>This vulnerability poses a potentially severe threat more damaging than the previously known <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/\">HTTP/2 Rapid Reset</a>, which resulted in some of the largest HTTP/2 DDoS attack campaigns in recorded history. During that campaign, thousands of hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks targeted Cloudflare. The attacks were multi-million requests per second strong. The average attack rate in that campaign, recorded by Cloudflare, was 30M rps. Approximately 89 of the attacks peaked above 100M rps and the largest one we saw hit 201M rps.

Furthermore, we are not currently aware of any threat actors exploiting this vulnerability in the wild.</p><p>Multiple CVEs have been assigned to the various implementations of HTTP/2 that are impacted by this vulnerability. A <a href=\"https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644\">CERT alert</a> published by Christopher Cullen at Carnegie Mellon University, which was covered by <a

China came in second, followed by Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, Iran, Singapore, India, and Argentina.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--10-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The top sources of HTTP DDoS attacks\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"903\"><figcaption>The top sources of HTTP DDoS attacks</figcaption></figure><p>At the network layer, source IP addresses can be <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/\">spoofed</a>. So, instead of relying on IP addresses to understand the source, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/reference/quarterly-ddos-reports/#source-country\">we use the location of our data centers</a> where the attack traffic was ingested. We can gain geographical accuracy due to Cloudflare’s large global coverage in over 310 cities around the world.</p><p>Using the location of our data centers, we can see that in the first quarter of 2024, over 40% L3/4 DDoS attack traffic was ingested in our US data centers, making the US the largest source of L3/4 attacks. Far behind, in second, Germany at 6%, followed by Brazil, Singapore, Russia, South Korea, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Japan.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--11-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The top sources of L3/4 DDoS attacks\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"903\"><figcaption>The top sources of L3/4 DDoS attacks</figcaption></figure><p>When normalizing the data by dividing the attack traffic by the total traffic to a given country or region, we get a totally different lineup. Almost a third of the HTTP traffic originating from Gibraltar was DDoS attack traffic, making it the largest source. In second place, Saint Helena, followed by the British Virgin Islands, Libya, Paraguay, Mayotte, Equatorial Guinea, Argentina, and Angola.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--12-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The top sources of HTTP DDoS attacks (normalized)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"903\"><figcaption>The top sources of HTTP DDoS attacks (normalized)</figcaption></figure><p>Back to the network layer, normalized, things look rather different as well. Almost 89% of the traffic we ingested in our Zimbabwe-based data centers were L3/4 DDoS attacks. In Paraguay, it was over 56%, followed by Mongolia reaching nearly a 35% attack share. Additional top locations included Moldova, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Djibouti, Azerbaijan, Haiti, and Dominican Republic.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--13-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The top sources of L3/4 DDoS attacks (normalized)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"974\"><figcaption>The top sources of L3/4 DDoS attacks (normalized)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"most-attacked-locations\">Most attacked locations</h3><p>When analyzing DDoS attacks against our customers, we use their <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/reference/quarterly-ddos-reports/#target-country\">billing country</a> to determine the “attacked country (or region)”. In the first quarter of 2024, the US was the most attacked by HTTP DDoS attacks. Approximately one out of every 10 DDoS requests that Cloudflare mitigated targeted the US.

Over 63% of HTTP traffic to Nicaragua was DDoS attack traffic, making it the most attacked location. In second, Albania, followed by Jordan, Guinea, San Marino, Georgia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--15-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Top attacked countries and regions by HTTP DDoS attacks (normalized)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"903\"><figcaption>Top attacked countries and regions by HTTP DDoS attacks (normalized)</figcaption></figure><p>On the network layer, China was the number one most attacked location, as 39% of all DDoS bytes that Cloudflare mitigated during the first quarter of 2024 were aimed at Cloudflare’s Chinese customers.

With four out of every 10 HTTP DDoS attacks lasting over 10 minutes and approximately three out of 10 extending beyond an hour, the challenge is substantial. Yet, whether an attack involves over 100,000 requests per second, as is the case in one out of every 10 attacks, or even exceeds a million requests per second — a rarity seen in only four out of every 1,000 attacks — Cloudflare’s defenses remain impenetrable.</p><p>Since pioneering <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/unmetered-mitigation\">unmetered DDoS Protection</a> in 2017, Cloudflare has steadfastly honored its promise to provide enterprise-grade <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/\">DDoS protection</a> at no cost to all organizations, ensuring that our advanced technology and robust network architecture do not just fend off attacks but also preserve performance without compromise.</p>",
