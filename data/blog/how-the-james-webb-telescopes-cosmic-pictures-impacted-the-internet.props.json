In our <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/popular-domains-year-in-review-2021/\">2021 Year in Review</a> we showed how NASA and SpaceX flew higher, at least in terms of interest on the Internet.</p><p>This week, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/first-images-from-the-james-webb-space-telescope\">NASA</a> in collaboration with the European Space Agency (<a href=\"https://esawebb.org/initiatives/webbs-first-images/\">ESA</a>) and the Canadian Space Agency (<a href=\"https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/\">CSA</a>), released the first images from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope\">James Webb Telescope</a> (JWST) which conducts infrared astronomy to “reveal the unseen universe”.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image3-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb%27s_First_Deep_Field\"><em>Webb's First Deep Field</em></a><em> is the first operational image taken by the James Webb Space Telescope, depicting a galaxy cluster with a distance of 5.12 billion light-years from Earth.

In terms of general Internet traffic in the US, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/us?date_filter=last_7_days\">Radar</a> shows us that there was an increase both on July 11 and July 12, compared to the previous week (bear in mind that July 4, the previous Monday, was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)\">Independence Day holiday</a> in the US).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image4-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Next, we look at DNS request trends to get a sense of traffic to Internet properties (and using from this point on EST time in all the charts). Let’s start with the cornucopia of <strong>NASA, ESA and other websites</strong> (there are many, some dedicated just to the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/\">James Webb Telescope findings</a>).</p><p>There are two clear spikes in the next chart. The first was around the time the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb%27s_First_Deep_Field\">first galaxy cluster infrared image</a> was announced by <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/president-biden-and-the-world-preview-webb-telescopes-first-image\">Joe Biden</a>, on Monday, July 11, 2022 (at 17:00), with traffic rising 13x higher than in the previous week. There was also a 5x spike at 01:00 EST that evening. The second spike was higher and longer and happened during Tuesday, July 12, 2022, when more images were <a href=\"https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/deploymentExplorer.html#43\">revealed</a>. Tuesday’s peak was at 10:00, with traffic being 19x higher than in the previous week — traffic was higher than 10x between 09:00 and 13:00.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image7-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The first image was presented by US president at around 17:00 on July 11. DNS traffic was 1.5x higher to <strong>White House-related websites</strong> than any time in the preceding month.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image5-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"conclusion-space-the-final-frontier\">Conclusion: space, the final frontier</h3><p>As we <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/popular-domains-year-in-review-2021/\">saw in 2021</a>, space projects and announcements continue to have a clear impact on the Internet, in this case in our DNS request view of Internet traffic. So far, what the James Webb Telescope images are showing us is a glimpse of a never-before-seen picture of parts of the universe (there’s no lack of excitement in Cloudflare’s internal chat groups).</p><p>You can keep an eye on these and other trends using <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar\">@CloudflareRadar</a> on Twitter — recently we covered extensively Canada’s Internet <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-view-of-the-rogers-communications-outage-in-canada/\">outage</a>.</p>",
