Sometimes it’s more about <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/expanding-multi-user-access/\">function</a>, other times it’s more about <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/time-for-an-update/\">form</a>, and most of the time it’s a combination of <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/a-new-look-on-your-cloudflare-dashboard/\">both</a>. But there’s one area of the site that many users visit even more frequently than they visit the homepage or their dashboard, and strangely enough it hasn’t really seen any major updates in years. And if you’re reading this, that means you're looking at it. </p><p>With more than 150 current contributors, and more than 1,000 posts, we have a lot of people dedicating a lot of their time to writing blog posts. And based on the responses I see in the comments, and on Twitter, there are a lot of people who really like to read what these authors have to say (whether it has much to do with Cloudflare or not). </p><p>Well, we’d like to finally give some love to the blog. And we really want to know what you, our loyal (or even occasional) readers, think. There are two options to choose from. Simply click the feedback button below and you can either answer some questions on a survey, or if you want to really go the extra mile you can choose to participate in a short, remote, user study with one of our researchers. Either way, we want to know what you think! </p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p align=center>\n<a class=\"btn btn-warning\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGU39TFExaW7WxBqm9kEamxhQjo00CZjsWDCrJOEdOkxMlkA/viewform?usp=sf_link\" target=\"_blank\">Submit Feedback</a>\n</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->",
