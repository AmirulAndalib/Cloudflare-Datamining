	<p>When we first started working on Cloudflare we knew a few things:</p>
	<p>​1. There was a huge and unmet need among small and mid-sized websites
		for better security and performance tools;2. We had great data from
		<a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Project Honey Pot</a> and other partners
		that could help us meet that need; but3. Virtually all the traditional
		solutions designed for enterprises wouldn't work for the websites who
		most needed help.
	</p>
	<p>If you're a big enterprise and you want performance and security you buy
		an expensive piece of hardware and contract with a content delivery
		network or highly connected data center. For the vast majority of
		websites online, this simply isn't an option. Not only is the cost
		prohibitive but most people with websites don't have access to their
		physical servers to install hardware. We knew we had to come up with a
		better, more modern way to deploy Cloudflare.</p>
	<p>One of Lee's great ideas when he and I started Project Honey Pot nearly
		seven years ago was to ask people to donate a portion of their DNS
		records to let us build spam traps. We also used the DNS system to
		deploy the Project's http:BL service. I'm friends with David from
		<a href="http://www.opendns.com/?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">OpenDNS</a> and liked how they were able to
		deploy an amazing security product on the web-surfer end of DNS. So,
		knowing all that about DNS, we set out to build a system that used DNS
		to supercharge websites.
	</p>
	<p>For Cloudflare to work we needed to build a globally distributed network
		of DNS servers. When you sign up for Cloudflare we give you two name
		servers to list with your registrar for your domain. In reality, these
		two name servers actually point to a whole cluster of many servers
		distributed in multiple data centers and load balanced (using anycast
		and other network voodoo) throughout the network.</p>
	<p>While most DNS providers give their nameservers boring names like
		"<a href="http://ns1.someboringservice.net/?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">ns1.someboringservice.net</a>", we
		wanted ours to have a personality that represented just how amazing they
		are. We spent a lot of time trying to think of what embodied the spirit
		of what these nameservers do for our users until we stumbled upon it:
		ninjas! They're fast. They're good at defending themselves. And they're
		stealthy. Just like Cloudflare.</p>
	<p>Today, when you sign up for Cloudflare, you are issued two Ninja
		Nameservers™ (one male, one female). We have a lot so, every website you
		sign up, you're likely to get a unique combination. Once deployed at
		your registrar, your assigned ninjas stand watch over your website
		keeping it safe and ensuring it performs as fast as possible. We had a
		really talented artist (Alaric Holloway) draw all the ninjas. Links to
		their full profiles will be online soon. In the meantime, I wanted to
		introduce: Igor, Alex, Phil, Isla, and Vera.</p>
	<p>A full album of all our ninjas can be found on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cloudflare" title="Cloudflare's Facebook Page" target="_blank">Facebook
