	<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are highly disruptive to businesses everywhere. According to the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-attack-trends-for-2022-q1">Cloudflare DDoS Attack Trends report</a>, in the first half of 2021 the world witnessed massive ransomware and ransom DDoS attack campaigns that interrupted critical infrastructure, including oil pipelines, healthcare, and financial services. In the second half, we saw a growing swarm of attacks, including one of the most powerful botnets deployed (<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/meris-botnet">Meris</a>), with record-breaking <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-blocks-an-almost-2-tbps-multi-vector-ddos-attack">network-layer attacks</a> observed on the Cloudflare network.</p>
	<p>Along with an increase in severity, there is a proliferation of automated toolkits that make it simple and cheap for anyone to launch these attacks. Detecting and stopping these attacks manually is not effective, and network security engineers are increasingly turning to automated tools to help ensure network and application availability.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos">DDoS protection</a> has evolved over the years from appliances to hybrid models to fully Internet-native solutions, like Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit">Magic Transit</a>. Cloudflare has been protecting millions of Internet properties against DDoS attacks, ensuring they are available at all times. Magic Transit extends Cloudflare’s industry-leading DDoS protection to shield entire IP subnets from DDoS attacks, while also accelerating network traffic, ensuring your data centers, cloud services and corporate networks are always reachable from the Internet. Our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network">powerful global network</a> spanning 250+ cities and 121 Tbps of capacity ensures that customers can have always-on DDoS protection without impacting network latency and application performance. Magic Transit also supports on-demand mode, which allows customers to activate DDoS protection when they need it most.</p>
	<p>Network observability becomes critical to understand what normal looks like for your environment so that DDoS attacks are readily detected. Flow-based monitoring helps you understand not only how much traffic is flowing over your network, but also where it came from, where it’s going, and what applications are consuming bandwidth.</p>

	<p>Cloudflare strives to simplify how customers can shield their network from <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-cyber-security">cybersecurity</a> threats like DDoS attacks. Magic Transit gives network security professionals the confidence that their network resources are immune from DDoS-related outages. We have now extended that same simplicity to this joint solution, making it simple for our customers to procure, provision, and integrate Magic Transit and Kentik. Our end goal is always creating the best experience possible for our customers, with Cloudflare’s services fitting seamlessly into their existing technology stack.</p>
	<p>Kentik’s powerful network observability cloud collects flow logs from your network components and continuously learns network behavior, detecting anomalies such as DDoS attacks. Using our native API integration, the Kentik platform can trigger Magic Transit to start attracting network traffic when there’s an attack underway. Magic Transit’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-dive-cloudflare-autonomous-edge-ddos-protection">autonomous DDoS mitigation</a> automatically analyzes incoming traffic and filters out DDoS traffic across the entire Cloudflare network, protecting your network from unwanted traffic and avoiding service availability issues and outages.</p>
	<p>Together, Kentik and Cloudflare have created a well-supported integration and a more streamlined procurement process to combine Kentik’s best-of-breed network observability and Cloudflare's industry-leading DDoS protection in Magic Transit. Customers can now receive the best DDoS protection and network observability in a completely SaaS-based offering.</p>
