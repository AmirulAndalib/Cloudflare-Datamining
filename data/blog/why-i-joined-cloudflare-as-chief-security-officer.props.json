Cybersecurity has always been my passion and focus of my career. I am grateful to join such a dynamic and innovative team. Cloudflare is a cybersecurity industry leader and offers unmatched technology that is second to none.</p><h3 id=\"a-little-about-me\">A little about me</h3><p>I have been a CSO for over 20 years in the financial and private sectors with SVB, HSBC, McAfee, Ameren, and Scottrade. I have been privileged to lead the security teams of some of the world's largest, most complex, and most innovative companies; however, my greatest honor has been working with and collaborating among some of the world's most amazing people. I have learned my dedication, expertise, and passion from my leaders, peers, and teams, which have taught me how to build and lead world-class security programs that <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/\">protect organizations from the most sophisticated threats</a>. Because security is constantly evolving, the key is, and always will be, to build an active, diverse community of highly empathetic people that will successfully protect the organization.</p><h3 id=\"my-charter\">My charter</h3><p>As I step into my new role as CSO at Cloudflare, I am excited to take on the challenge of defending the company and 20% of all websites. My charter is to protect Cloudflare from sophisticated threats and to promote a culture of innovation that enables us to stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. By fostering a mindset of creativity and continuous improvement, we will develop solutions that protect our customers from the most complex cybersecurity challenges that significantly impact them.</p><p>The last aspect of my charter is to share the Cloudflare story with our customers to ensure they are protected and leverage all of the Cloudflare technology. Â We can do this through collaboration and knowledge-sharing with our customers. By sharing the Cloudflare story and collaborating with our customers, we can all help build a better and more secure Internet.</p><h3 id=\"why-cloudflare\">Why Cloudflare</h3><p>As someone who is passionate about technology, security, and its potential to improve our lives, I knew that I wanted to work for a company that shared those values. So, when I began my job search, I set out to find the best company to work for that aligned with my interests and career goals. After researching and considering many different options, I met with Cloudflare, and I was blown away.</p><p>First and foremost, I was drawn to Cloudflare's mission to help create a secure, faster, and more reliable Internet for everyone. I was impressed by their strong mission, direction, and commitment to building a better Internet. As someone who shares their passion for making the Internet a better place, I found it inspiring to join a company with a mission that aligns so closely with my own values.</p><p>Another reason I chose to join Cloudflare was its network capabilities and cloud technology. They have built a highly sophisticated and innovative global network that I have not seen matched within the industry. As a CSO, I find Cloudflare in a unique leadership position to protect our customers due to their unmatched capabilities and unique market position. While Cloudflare is already a leader in every space where they operate, they have a significant track record of building on their fantastic platform by continuously improving their technology to be best in class.</p><p>In addition to their impressive technology, I was also impressed by their customer base. The most prominent and respected companies in the world use Cloudflare's services, and I am excited to share \"How Cloudflare does it\" to help our customers be even more successful and give them a unique opportunity to see how we do it internally.</p><p>Lastly, the interview process and the people I met at Cloudflare significantly influenced my decision to join the team. Throughout my 17 interviews, I was impressed by the professionalism and passion of the people I met. I connected with each person and was excited by the team's commitment to the company's mission. I am very proud and humbled to join the Cloudflare family! I look forward to hearing from our customers and employees and how I can help them!</p>",
