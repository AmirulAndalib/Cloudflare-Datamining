With Cloudflare Tunnel, teams can expose anything to the world, from internal subnets to containers, in a secure and fast way. Thanks to recent developments with our <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/603\">Terraform provider</a> and the advent of <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnels-that-live-forever/\">Named Tunnels</a> it’s never been easier to spin up.</p><h3 id=\"classic-tunnels-to-named-tunnels\">Classic Tunnels to Named Tunnels</h3><p>Historically, the biggest limitation to using Cloudflare Tunnel at scale was that the process to create a tunnel was manual. A user needed to download the binary for their OS, install/compile it, and then run the command <code>cloudflared tunnel login</code>. This would open a browser to their Cloudflare account so they could download a <code>cert.pem</code> file to authenticate their tunnel against Cloudflare’s edge with their account.</p><p>With the jump to Named Tunnels and a supported <a href=\"https://api.cloudflare.com/#argo-tunnel-create-argo-tunnel\">API endpoint</a> Cloudflare users can automate this manual process. Named Tunnels also moved to allow a <code>.json</code> file for the origin side tunnel credentials instead of (or with) the <code>cert.pem</code> file. It has been a dream of mine since joining Cloudflare to write a Cloudflare Tunnel as code, along with my instance/application, and deploy it while I go walk my dog. Tooling should be easy to deploy and robust to use. That dream is now a reality and my dog could not be happier.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2021/05/image3-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"okay-so-what\">Okay, so what?</h3><p>The ability to dynamically generate a tunnel and tie it into a back end application(s) brings several benefits to users including: putting more of their Cloudflare config in code, auto-scaling resources, dynamically spinning up resources such as bastion servers for secure logins, and saving time from avoiding manually generating/maintaining tunnels.</p><p>Tunnels also allow traffic to connect securely into Cloudflare’s edge for <em>only</em> the particular account they are affiliated with. In a world where IPs are increasingly ephemeral, tunnels allow for a modern approach to tying your application(s) into Cloudflare. Putting automation around tunnels allows teams to incorporate them into their existing CI/CD (continuous improvement/continuous development) pipelines.</p><p>Most importantly, the spin up of an environment securely tied into Cloudflare can be achieved with some Terraform config and then by running <code>terraform apply</code>. I can then go take my pup on an adventure while my environment kicks off.</p><h3 id=\"why-terraform\">Why Terraform?</h3><p>While there are numerous Infrastructure as Code tools out there, Terraform has an actively maintained <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs\">Cloudflare provider</a>. This is not to say that this same functionality cannot be re-created by making use of the API endpoint with a tool of your choice. The overarching concepts here should translate quite nicely. Using Terraform we can deploy Cloudflare resources, origin resources, and configure our server all with one tool. Let’s see what setting that up looks like.</p><h3 id=\"terraform-config\">Terraform Config</h3><p>The technical bits of this will cover how to set up an automated Named Tunnel that will proxy traffic to a Google compute instance (GCP) which is my backend for this example. These concepts should be the same regardless of where you host your applications such as an onprem location to a multi-cloud solution.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/ingress\">Cloudflare Tunnel’s Ingress Rules</a>, we can use a single tunnel to proxy traffic to a number of local services. In our case we will tie into a Docker container running <a href=\"https://httpbin.org/\">HTTPbin</a> and the local SSH daemon. These endpoints are being used to represent a standard login protocol (such as SSH or RDP) and an example web application (HTTPbin). We can even take it a step further by applying a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/access/\">Zero Trust framework with Cloudflare Access</a> over the SSH hostname.</p><p>The version of Terraform used in this example is 0.15.0. Please refer to the provider documentation when using the Cloudflare Terraform provider. Tunnels are compatible with Terraform version 0.13+.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>cdlg at cloudflare in ~/Documents/terraform/blog on master\n$ terraform --version\nTerraform v0.15.0\non darwin_amd64\n+ provider registry.terraform.io/cloudflare/cloudflare v2.18.0\n+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google v3.56.0\n+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v3.0.1\n+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/template v2.2.0\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Here is what the Terraform hierarchy looks like for this setup.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>cdlg at cloudflare in ~/Documents/terraform/blog on master\n$ tree .\n.\n├── README.md\n├── access.tf\n├── argo.tf\n├── bootstrap.tf\n├── instance.tf\n├── server.tpl\n├── terraform.tfstate\n├── terraform.tfstate.backup\n├── terraform.tfvars\n├── terraform.tfvars.example\n├── test.plan\n└── versions.tf\n\n0 directories, 12 files\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We can ignore the files <code>README.md</code> and <code>terraform.tfvars.example</code> for now.

One thing to note is the usage of variables throughout the files. For example, the value of <code>var.cloudflare_zone</code> is populated with the value provided to it from the <code>terraform.tfvars</code> file. This allows the configuration to be used as a template with other deployments. The only change that would be necessary is updating the relevant variables, such as in the <code>terraform.tfvars</code> file, when re-using the configuration.</p><p>When using a credentials file (vs environment variables such as a <code>.tfvars</code> file) it is very important that this file is exempted from the version tracking tool. With git this is accomplished with a <code>.gitignore</code> file. Before running this example the <code>terraform.tfvars.example</code> file is copied to <code>terraform.tfvars</code> within the same directory and filled in as needed. The <code>.gitignore</code> file is told to ignore any file named <code>terraform.tfvars</code> to exempt the actual variables from version tracking.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>cdlg at cloudflare in ~/Documents/terraform/blog on master\n$ cat .gitignore\n# Local .terraform directories\n**/.terraform/*\n\n# .tfstate files\n*.tfstate\n*.tfstate.*\n\n# Crash log files\ncrash.log\n\n# Ignore any .tfvars files that are generated automatically for each Terraform run.

To create a Cloudflare Tunnel in Terraform we only need to set the following resources in our Terraform config (this is what populates the <code>argo.tf</code> file).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>resource &quot;random_id&quot; &quot;argo_secret&quot; {\n  byte_length = 35\n}\n\nresource &quot;cloudflare_argo_tunnel&quot; &quot;auto_tunnel&quot; {\n  account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id\n  name       = &quot;zero_trust_ssh_http&quot;\n  secret     = random_id.argo_secret.b64_std\n}\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That’s it.</p><p>Technically you could get away with just the <code>cloudflare_argo_tunnel</code> resource, but using the <code>random_id</code> resource helps with not having to hard code the secret for the tunnel. Instead we can dynamically generate a secret for our tunnel each time we run Terraform.</p><p>Let’s break down what is happening in the <code>cloudflare_argo_tunnel</code> resource: we are passing the Cloudflare account ID (via the <code>var.cloudflare_account_id</code> variable), a name for our tunnel, and the dynamically generated secret for the tunnel, which is pulled from the <code>random_id</code> resource. Tunnels expect the secret to be in base64 standard encoding and at least 32 characters.</p><p>Using Named Tunnels now gives customers a UUID (universal unique identity) target to tie their applications to. These endpoints are routed off an internal domain to Cloudflare and can only be used with zones in your account, as mentioned earlier. This means that one tunnel can proxy multiple applications for various zones in your account, thanks to Cloudflare Tunnel Ingress Rules.</p><p>Now that we have a target for our services, we can create a tunnel/applications in the GCP instance. Terraform has a feature called a <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/functions/templatefile.html\">templatefile function</a> that allows you to pass input variables as local variables (i.e. what the server can use to configure things) to an argument called <code>metadata_startup_script</code>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>resource &quot;google_compute_instance&quot; &quot;origin&quot; {\n...\n  metadata_startup_script = templatefile(&quot;./server.tpl&quot;, \n    {\n      web_zone    = var.cloudflare_zone,\n      account     = var.cloudflare_account_id,\n      tunnel_id   = cloudflare_argo_tunnel.auto_tunnel.id,\n      tunnel_name = cloudflare_argo_tunnel.auto_tunnel.name,\n      secret      = random_id.argo_secret.b64_std\n    })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This abbreviated section of the <code>google_compute_instance</code> resource shows a templatefile using 5 variables passed to the file located at <code>./server.tpl</code>. The file <code>server.tpl</code> is a bash script within the local directory that will configure the newly created GCP instance.</p><p>As indicated earlier, Named Tunnels can make use of a JSON credentials file instead of the historic use of a <code>cert.pem</code> file. By using a templatefile function pointing to a bash script (or cloud-init, etc…) we can dynamically generate the fields that populate both the <code>cert.json</code> file and the <code>config.yml</code> file used for Ingress Rules on the server/host. Then the bash script can install <code>cloudflared</code> as <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/run-tunnel/run-as-service\">a system service</a>, so it is persistent (i.e it can come back up after the machine is rebooted). Here is an example of this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb\nmkdir ~/.cloudflared\ntouch ~/.cloudflared/cert.json\ntouch ~/.cloudflared/config.yml\ncat &gt; ~/.cloudflared/cert.json &lt;&lt; &quot;EOF&quot;\n{\n    &quot;AccountTag&quot;   : &quot;${account}&quot;,\n    &quot;TunnelID&quot;     : &quot;${tunnel_id}&quot;,\n    &quot;TunnelName&quot;   : &quot;${tunnel_name}&quot;,\n    &quot;TunnelSecret&quot; : &quot;${secret}&quot;\n}\nEOF\ncat &gt; ~/.cloudflared/config.yml &lt;&lt; &quot;EOF&quot;\ntunnel: ${tunnel_id}\ncredentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/cert.json\nlogfile: /var/log/cloudflared.log\nloglevel: info\n\ningress:\n  - hostname: ${web_zone}\n    service: http://localhost:8080\n  - hostname: ssh.${web_zone}\n    service: ssh://localhost:22\n  - hostname: &quot;*&quot;\n    service: hello-world\nEOF\n\nsudo cloudflared service install\nsudo cp -via ~/.cloudflared/cert.json /etc/cloudflared/\n\ncd /tmp\nsudo docker-compose up -d &amp;&amp; sudo service cloudflared start\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In this example, a <a href=\"https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html\">heredoc</a> is used to fill in the variable fields for the <code>cert.json</code> file and another heredoc is used to fill in the <code>config.yml</code> (Ingress Rules) file with the variables we set in Terraform. Taking a quick look at the <code>cert.json</code> file we can see that the Account ID is provided to it which secures the tunnel to your specific account. The UUID  of the tunnel is then passed in along with the name that was assigned in the tunnel’s name argument. Lastly the 35 character secret is then passed to the tunnel. These are the necessary parameters to get our tunnel spun up against Cloudflare’s edge.</p><p>The <code>config.yml</code> file is where we set up the Ingress Rules for the Cloudflare Tunnel. The first few lines tell the tunnel which UUID to attach to, where the credentials are on the OS, and where the tunnel should write logs to. The log level of <code>info</code> is good for general use but for troubleshooting <code>debug</code> may be needed.</p><p>Next the first - <code>hostname:</code> line says any requests bound for that particular hostname need to be proxied to the service (HTTPbin) running at <code>localhost</code> port 8080. Following that the SSH target is defined and will proxy requests to the local SSH port. The next hostname is interesting in that we have a wildcard character. This functionality allows other zones or hostnames on the Account to point to the tunnel without being explicitly defined in Ingress Rules. The service that will respond to these requests is a built in <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/ingress#supported-protocols\">hello world service</a> the tunnel provides.</p><p>Pretty neat, but what else can we do? We can block all <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/faq/tunnel/#how-can-origin-servers-be-secured-when-using-tunnel\">inbound networking</a> to the server and instead use Cloudflare Tunnel to proxy the connections to Cloudflare’s edge.
