		Cloudflare is excited to turn up our newest data center in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, making over 7 million Internet properties even faster. This is our 122nd data center globally, and our 41st data center in Asia. By the end of 2018, we expect that 95% of the world's population will live in a country with a Cloudflare data center, as we grow our global network to span 200 cities.</p>
	<h3 id="cambodianinternet">Cambodian Internet</h3>
	<p>Home to over 16 million people, Cambodia has a relatively low base of Internet penetration (~25%) today, but is seeing an increasing number of Internet users coming online. For perspective, Cambodia has approximately the same number of Internet users as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/marhaba-beirut-cloudflares-121st-pop">Lebanon</a> (where we just turned up our 121st data center!) or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-singapore-data-center-now-online">Singapore</a> (from where we used to serve a portion of Cambodian visitors).</p>

	<p>In the coming weeks, weâ€™ll further optimize our routing for Cloudflare customers and expect to see a growing number of ISPs pick up our customersâ€™ traffic on a low latency path.</p>

	<h3 id="comingupnext">Coming up next</h3>
	<p>Next up, in fact, thousands of feet further up, we head to the mountains for Cloudflareâ€™s 123rd data center. Following that, two upcoming Cloudflare data centers are located well south of the Equator, and a continent away.</p>
