	<p>The Eurovision Song Contest has a history that goes back to 1956, so it's even older than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">European Union</a> and one of its highlights over the years was being the first global stage for the Swedish group ABBA — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FsVeMz1F5c&amp;ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Waterloo</a> won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_1974?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">1974 edition</a>). This year, for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2022?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">66th edition</a>, we have a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/eurovision-2022?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">dedicated page</a> for Eurovision fans, journalists or anyone interested in following Internet trends related to the event taking place in Turin, Italy. </p>
	<p>The contest consists of two semi-finals and a final. The first semi-final is today, May 10, at 21:00 CEST, the second is Thursday, May 12, at 21:00 CEST. And the final is on Saturday, May 14, at 21:00 CEST. We are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Summer_Time?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Central European Summer Time</a> and not our usual (on <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Radar</a>) UTC because that’s the timezone of most of the 40 countries that will take part in the contest. There will be 17 countries in the first semi-final, 18 in the second, and 25 in the final (the full list is <a href="https://eurovision.tv/event/turin-2022/participants?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

	<p>First, you can see the Internet traffic aggregate in all the 40 countries that are participating in Eurovision 2022. There’s also a toggle to choose each of the 40 countries regarding Internet traffic. If you pass the mouse over the traffic line, the traffic level hour by hour is also highlighted.</p>

	<p>Then, we use DNS name resolution data to estimate traffic from the 40 participating countries to several types of websites. We have a video platforms chart as Eurovision has content on major video platforms. The baseline for the values we use is the average of the previous week, represented in the charts.</p>

	<p>We also show social media trends in the participating countries, by hour, to see if the Eurovision semi-finals and final cause a change. </p>
	<p>The contest has a large base of fan websites (there’s even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGAE?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">OGAE</a>, <em>General Organisation of Eurovision Fans</em>), and we also have a chart for Eurovision fan sites. In this chart, yesterday at 20:00 CEST, traffic was already at its highest since May 1, with 6.22x more than the average of the previous week (that’s the baseline here). </p>

	<p>Last, but not least, we also show the impact on national official broadcasters' websites from the participating countries. For all the charts, there’s a download button to save the image file like this: </p>

	<p>For this evening's first semi-final, Portugal is participating and since we’re writing this blog post from our Lisbon office, I asked everyone’s favorite songs for the 2022 Eurovision edition. Norway’s song from Subwoolfer, <a href="https://eurovision.tv/participant/subwoolfer-22?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Give That Wolf A Banana</a>, was one of the favorites, followed by Portugal’s song from MARO, <a href="https://eurovision.tv/participant/maro-22?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Saudade, Saudade</a>.</p>
	<p>The UK’s song from Sam Ryder, <a href="https://eurovision.tv/participant/sam-ryder-22?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">SPACE MAN</a>, is automatically in Saturday’s final and was also praised at the Lisbon office, the same with France’s song from Alvan &amp; Ahez, called <a href="https://eurovision.tv/participant/alvan-and-ahez-22?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Fulenn</a>, where the group sings in their native language, Breton (from the French region of Brittany).</p>
	<p>Besides our dedicated Eurovision page, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/eurovision-2022?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">radar.cloudflare.com/eurovision-2022</a>, we will also be checking this week for some trends on <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Cloudflare Radar’s Twitter account</a>. Let the songs (and the Internet trends) begin.</p>
