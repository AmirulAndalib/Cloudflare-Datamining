Beyond that, we’re also super excited to be broadening the eligibility criteria, so more startups can qualify for the plan.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-cloudflare-startup-plan-include\">What does the Cloudflare Startup Plan include?</h2><p>There’s a lot of additional value that’s in the latest version of the plan.
