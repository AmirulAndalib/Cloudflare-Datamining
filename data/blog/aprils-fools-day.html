	<p>It is a beautiful morning in San Francisco and the office was full of April Fool's jokes. The creativity was spearheaded by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/people.html">Matthieu</a>, who recruited Matthew and Jason to help him execute several ideas.</p>
	<p>The pranks included wrapping Lee's desk in parcel paper, packaging Ian's desk in bubble wrap, controlling Sri's computer remotely with a foot and making my desk look like it just stepped into a flurry of sticky notes. It was a fun way to start everyone's day. Thanks Matthieu!</p>
	<p>And then, after all the fun died down, it was Matthieu's turn to be pranked. Jason did a switch-and-bait on his keyboard that made it difficult to type in French. Jason removed the windows key that Matthieu uses to make accents when writing in French. Quel plaisir!</p>
	<p>The stakes have been raised for next year. The planning is already underway.</p>
