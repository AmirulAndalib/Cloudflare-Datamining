This blog post examines Internet traffic trends and cyberattack activity on election day, highlighting notable declines in traffic during the afternoon and evening as well as a DDoS attack on a political party shortly after polls closed.</p><p>For context, 2024 is considered “the year of elections,” with elections taking place in over 60 countries. We’ve covered elections in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-insights-on-2024-elections-in-the-netherlands-south-africa-iceland-india-and-mexico\">South Africa, India, Iceland, Mexico</a>, the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/exploring-the-2024-eu-election-internet-traffic-trends-and-cybersecurity-insights\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/first-round-of-french-election-2024-party-attacks-and-a-modest-traffic-dip\">France</a>, and also the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-first-2024-us-presidential-debate-influenced-internet-traffic-and-security-trends\">2024 US presidential debate</a>. We also continuously update our <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024\">election report</a> on Cloudflare Radar.</p><p>The UK’s snap election on Thursday, July 4, 2024, typical of British <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/why-are-uk-general-elections-always-on-a-thursday-b1168631.html\">Thursday weekday</a> elections, contrasts with weekend elections in other countries. Polling stations were open from 07:00 to 22:00.</p><p>Generally, <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/election-security\">election days</a> do not result in drastic changes to Internet traffic. Traffic typically dips during voting hours but not as sharply as during major events like national holidays, and rises in the evening as results are announced.</p><p>On July 4, 2024, traffic initially rose slightly from the previous week, then fell around noon (-2%). Significant declines began only after 16:00, with noticeable drops at 16:45 and again at 22:00 as polls closed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"417\"></figure><h3 id=\"internet-traffic-dips-across-uk-countries\">Internet traffic dips across UK countries</h3><p>Traffic shifts during voting day, compared to the previous week, are more revealing when viewed in detail.

(-5%), and England (-3%), all after 16:00.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-at-14.17.05.png\"

Peak increases were reached at different times: Wales saw a 3% increase at 01:00; Northern Ireland and England experienced their highest increases of 12% and 11% respectively at 02:00; and Scotland had a 9% increase at 02:00 followed by a 12% spike at 04:00.</p><h3 id=\"dns-trends-news-outlets-bring-results\">DNS trends: news outlets bring results</h3><p>Switching focus to domain trends, our <a href=\"http://1.1.1.1\">1.1.1.1</a> resolver DNS data reveals a more targeted impact from the UK elections.

Official results weren’t continuously updated as they came in. The largest spike in DNS traffic, a 172% increase from the previous week, occurred on election morning around 07:00 local time. This increase likely happened because UK citizens were searching for the correct polling stations and other voting resources.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--7-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"415\"></figure><p>News sites and microblogging social media platforms in the UK experienced significant increases in usage after the polling stations closed at 22:00 local time.

But, as we’ve seen at the start of the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine\">war in Ukraine</a> or more recently in the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/dutch-political-websites-hit-by-cyber-attacks-as-eu-voting-starts\">Netherlands</a> or in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/first-round-of-french-election-2024-party-attacks-and-a-modest-traffic-dip\">France</a>, specific events do trigger attacks. DDoS (<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">Distributed Denial of Service</a>) attacks remain a common method employed by attackers.</p><p>In recent days, there has been DDoS activity targeting political parties in the UK that participated in these elections. Our data shows that two parties experienced attacks that were blocked by Cloudflare. One party, represented in blue, suffered an attack on June 16, which lasted over four hours and peaked at 60,000 requests per second (rps).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--10-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"659\"></figure><p>The party shown in yellow was hit by four DDoS attacks on different days: June 13, 19, 26, and in the early hours of July 5 (UTC), just after the election’s first predictions were broadcast, giving a majority to the Labour Party. This was the most significant attack in recent days, peaking at 156,000 rps. It began at 01:47 local time (00:47 UTC) and ended four minutes later.
