This blog post examines Internet traffic trends and cyberattack activity on election day, highlighting notable declines in traffic during the afternoon and evening as well as a DDoS attack on a political party shortly after polls closed.</p><p>For context, 2024 is considered “the year of elections,” with elections taking place in over 60 countries. We’ve covered elections in <a href=\"/internet-insights-on-2024-elections-in-the-netherlands-south-africa-iceland-india-and-mexico\">South Africa, India, Iceland, Mexico</a>, the <a href=\"/exploring-the-2024-eu-election-internet-traffic-trends-and-cybersecurity-insights\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"/first-round-of-french-election-2024-party-attacks-and-a-modest-traffic-dip\">France</a>, and also the <a href=\"/how-the-first-2024-us-presidential-debate-influenced-internet-traffic-and-security-trends\">2024 US presidential debate</a>. We also continuously update our <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024\">election report</a> on Cloudflare Radar.</p><p>The UK’s snap election on Thursday, July 4, 2024, typical of British <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/why-are-uk-general-elections-always-on-a-thursday-b1168631.html\">Thursday weekday</a> elections, contrasts with weekend elections in other countries. Polling stations were open from 07:00 to 22:00.</p><p>Generally, <a href=\"/tag/election-security\">election days</a> do not result in drastic changes to Internet traffic. Traffic typically dips during voting hours but not as sharply as during major events like national holidays, and rises in the evening as results are announced.</p><p>On July 4, 2024, traffic initially rose slightly from the previous week, then fell around noon (-2%). Significant declines began only after 16:00, with noticeable drops at 16:45 and again at 22:00 as polls closed.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4nVPnLCsLcmzD3wDn3V25f/1806475d806f2e5c3a2e9a07bacc697f/unnamed-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"417\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>Internet traffic dips across UK countries</h3><p>Traffic shifts during voting day, compared to the previous week, are more revealing when viewed in detail.

Official results weren’t continuously updated as they came in. The largest spike in DNS traffic, a 172% increase from the previous week, occurred on election morning around 07:00 local time. This increase likely happened because UK citizens were searching for the correct polling stations and other voting resources.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6j7wLLGkdPEJlh0AO0kQiC/4c6e400d8a51051490566867bbdbeb41/unnamed--7-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"415\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>News sites and microblogging social media platforms in the UK experienced significant increases in usage after the polling stations closed at 22:00 local time.

But, as we’ve seen at the start of the <a href=\"/one-year-of-war-in-ukraine\">war in Ukraine</a> or more recently in the <a href=\"/dutch-political-websites-hit-by-cyber-attacks-as-eu-voting-starts\">Netherlands</a> or in <a href=\"/first-round-of-french-election-2024-party-attacks-and-a-modest-traffic-dip\">France</a>, specific events do trigger attacks. DDoS (<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">Distributed Denial of Service</a>) attacks remain a common method employed by attackers.</p><p>In recent days, there has been DDoS activity targeting political parties in the UK that participated in these elections. Our data shows that two parties experienced attacks that were blocked by Cloudflare. One party, represented in blue, suffered an attack on June 16, which lasted over four hours and peaked at 60,000 requests per second (rps).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1adSZmNlwTmGPYiPjoSEUb/9439afc176920f7f816da25a4af39622/unnamed--10-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"659\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The party shown in yellow was hit by four DDoS attacks on different days: June 13, 19, 26, and in the early hours of July 5 (UTC), just after the election’s first predictions were broadcast, giving a majority to the Labour Party. This was the most significant attack in recent days, peaking at 156,000 rps. It began at 01:47 local time (00:47 UTC) and ended four minutes later. Here’s a closer look at that July 5, 2024, attack:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4C7S91vR409ztcqCybWl0p/1190d9bcdf18ba7bfd6b2f86ba94e0de/unnamed--11-.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"469\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Although these rates are small on Cloudflare’s scale, they can be devastating for unprotected websites unaccustomed to such levels of traffic.</p><h3>Conclusion: high intensity election year</h3><p>Even if major political events don’t always bring notable changes to Internet traffic, our data shows that in the UK, traffic decreased more significantly in the afternoon and evening, especially as voting stations remained open until 22:00.</p><p>After voting ended, news sites became the go-to resource for UK residents seeking initial predictions and results.</p><p>We also observed attacks targeting political parties in the UK, further highlighting that this election year is marked by cyberattacks aimed at influencing politically related websites.</p><p>If you want to follow more trends and insights about the Internet and elections in particular, you can check <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a>, and more specifically our new <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/elections-2024\">2024 Elections Insights</a> report, which will be updated as elections take place throughout the year.</p>",
