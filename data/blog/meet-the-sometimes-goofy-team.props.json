We were named the Most Innovative Company at the conference and came in second in the overall competition. Recently we were invited by TechCrunch to write an update on <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/24/disrupt-cloudflare-omfg/\">what's happened since<br>\nour launch</a>.</p>\n<p>As part of that, the team decided to put together a spoof video of a typical day in the CloudFlare office. While we're serious about web performance and security, we can have fun too!
