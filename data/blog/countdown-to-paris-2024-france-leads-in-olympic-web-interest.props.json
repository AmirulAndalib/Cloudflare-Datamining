Despite France leading in overall DNS traffic to Olympic sites since January, as seen on the world map above, this particular day saw the largest spikes originating from other countries. These spikes were most prominent from Germany, Russia, the US, the UK, France, Brazil, and Australia, in that order.</p><p>What caused these spikes? Several <a href=\"https://www.francsjeux.com/en/short/more-than-a-thousand-jobs-to-be-filled-at-cojo/\">press conferences</a> related to the Olympics took place that day. One major announcement, covered globally, declared that for the first time, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/world-athletics-olympic-prize-money-867d25da6c5a25abbaef5b5859f4e780\">Olympics would offer prize money</a>, with track and field gold medalists receiving $50,000. The following chart illustrates the spike in DNS traffic in these countries on that day.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/image1-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"813\"></figure><h3 id=\"france%E2%80%99s-trends-interest-in-tickets-comes-first\">France’s trends: interest in tickets comes first</h3><p>In France, the host nation, ticket sale days significantly influenced DNS traffic to official Olympic websites. The most obvious spike occurred on February 8, 2024, marking the start of the first phase of ticket sales for 2024, called the “<a href=\"https://press.paris2024.org/news/new-tickets-for-the-games-on-sale-on-8-february-c50f-7578a.html\">Paris 2024 official ticketing website surprise releases</a>.” On that day, daily DNS traffic was double that of the previous week. A significant surge was also observed at 10:00 local time, coinciding with the ticket release, which saw an hourly DNS traffic increase of 398% compared to the previous week.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--6--5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"644\"></figure><p>The week of March 3, 2024, saw the highest DNS traffic to Olympic-related sites in France so far. The most significant increase occurred on March 4, the day the “<a href=\"https://press.paris2024.org/news/athletics-special-ticket-sale-on-4-march-from-10-am-a42d-7578a.html\">Athletics Special</a>” ticket sales began for events at the Stade de France, which also coincided with the unveiling of the Olympic poster. On this day, daily DNS traffic rose by 45% compared to the previous week. Other notable periods included the weeks of May 12 and May 19, when the <a href=\"https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/olympic-torch-relay/route\">Olympic torch arrived in France</a> and started its journey through various cities. April 14 also marked a critical day, offering one of the last chances to purchase <a href=\"https://press.paris2024.org/news/250-000-new-tickets-for-the-olympic-games-go-on-sale-this-wednesday-17-april-3b63-7578a.html\">250,000 tickets</a> for major events.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--2--6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"588\"></figure><h3 id=\"%E2%80%9Colympics%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cparis-2024%E2%80%9D-emails-on-the-rise\">“Olympics” and “Paris 2024” emails on the rise</h3><p>From a cybersecurity perspective, as major events often attract phishing and spam, we’ve analyzed email trends related to the Olympics—recently we did the same for the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-first-2024-us-presidential-debate-influenced-internet-traffic-and-security-trends\">Biden vs Trump US presidential debate</a>. From January 2024 up to late-July, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/\">Cloudflare’s Cloud Email Security</a> service processed well over half a million emails containing “Olympics” or “Paris 2024” in the subject. The week of July 15 saw the highest number of such emails, marking a 694% increase compared to the busiest week in January.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--3--6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"462\"></figure><p>Regarding unwanted messages, spam accounted for 1.5% of all emails with “Olympics” or “Paris 2024” in the subject, while malicious emails made up 0.2%. This means that in a sample of 1000 emails, roughly 15 would be spam and about 2 would be malicious. The week with the highest percentage of malicious Olympic-related emails was May 6, with 0.6% classified as malicious. Declining after that peak, it ticked back up in July, to 0.4% on July 8.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--4--5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"468\"></figure><p>Furthermore, the week of June 24 witnessed the highest proportion of spam emails for the year so far, at 7% of all emails.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--5--5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"466\"></figure><p>As the Olympics opening ceremony approaches, we expect the volume of related emails, and the proportion of malicious and spam emails, to increase.
