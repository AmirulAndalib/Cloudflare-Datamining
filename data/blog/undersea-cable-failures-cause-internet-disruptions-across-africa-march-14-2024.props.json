The company also explains that the recent cable cuts in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1762447960074330340?s=20\">Red Sea</a> in combination with today’s cable issues, “has impacted all Africa capacity”.</p><p>In addition to the impacts to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, the <a href=\"https://www.mainone.net/\">website of MainOne</a>, owners of the <a href=\"https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/mainone\">MainOne submarine cable</a>, was offline for several hours.
