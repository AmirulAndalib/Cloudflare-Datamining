	<p>Over the last 18 months, the CloudFlare team has been busy building massive scale across hundreds of thousands of websites. As our <a href="https://cloudflare.com/network-map">network</a> continues to grow, it becomes smarter, giving us insight into <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/how-to-secure-a-website">website security</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization">performance</a> that no other company has.</p>
	<p>Thanks to the knowledge gained from this massive scale, and to all of our customers who have joined the CloudFlare network, we are now able to provide a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security">performance and security solution</a> for businesses and enterprises that is unlike anything else on the market. We are very excited to announce our newest tiers of service: CloudFlare Business and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise">CloudFlare Enterprise</a>.</p>
	<h3>What the New Plans Offer</h3>
	<p>CloudFlare Business and CloudFlare Enterprise add higher levels of customer support, greater customization, and full service level agreements to CloudFlare's existing products. The business-oriented plans also include new technologies including CloudFlare's Advanced DDoS Protection and CloudFlare's Railgunâ„¢ Web Optimization.</p>
	<h3>What Some Business and Enterprise Customers are Saying</h3>
	<p>We have been quietly testing CloudFlare Business and CloudFlare Enterprise with a number of customers with sites ranging from <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce">ecommerce</a> to high-traffic to Fortune 500 to national governments. Their feedback speaks for itself:[</p>

	<p>"CloudFlare offers the first effective execution of a holistic approach to both performance and security for web applications, in a technology landscape otherwise rife with solutions specializing in either one," said Chris Holland, Director of Technology for LuxuryLink. "Having <b>helped us achieve improved performance while saving us 40 percent in monthly bandwidth</b>, I feel that CloudFlare's philosophy, technological leadership and innovative platforms are best aligned with our commitment to providing a world-class online experience to our discerningaudience."</p>

	<p>"I test a lot of denial of service attack tools, including the ones used by Anonymous, but it has become a dull exercise because CloudFlare stops them all," explained Sam Bowne, Professor of Cybersecurity at the City College of San Francisco and a leading researcher in denial of service attack mitigation. "CloudFlare has <b>completely changed the game, making DoS and DDoS into trivial, solved problems</b>."</p>
	<h3>Continuing to Invest in Free and Pro Tiers</h3>
	<p>Rest assured if you are a current CloudFlare user who loves our existing service, things are only going to get better. This week, we've also added new image optimization features to our Pro service (<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-mirage-intelligent-image-loading">Mirage</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-polish-automatic-image-optimizati">Polish</a>). As CloudAve tweeted this morning, these two web performance features alone make upgrading to CloudFlare Pro a "no brainer."</p>
	<p>We will continue to invest in our existing Free and Pro plans. We are 100% committed to always provide a free service with at least the feature set that it has today. Over time,some of the features that are part of paid plans will migrate down into the free service. All our customers, at any level, will benefit from our ongoing network expansion (and we'll have big things to announce on that front shortly) as we continue to make the Internet a faster, safer, better place for everyone.</p>
