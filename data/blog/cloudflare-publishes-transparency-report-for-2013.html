	<p>On January 27, the Department of Justice and the Director of National Intelligence <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/January/14-ag-081.html">announced</a> a change in rules governing the disclosure of National Security Orders, affording slightly more latitude in how companies could report the number of National Security Orders which they had received. Within several hours, CloudFlare presented its initial <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-transparency-report-on-national-security-orders">Transparency Report on National Security Orders</a>.</p>
