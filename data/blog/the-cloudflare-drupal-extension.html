	<p>A Drupal developer, <a href="http://www.brianstevenson.com">Brian Stevenson</a>, recently created a <a href="https://drupal.org/project/cloudflare">CloudFlare Drupal extension</a> that will help Drupal site owners get the original visitor IP at the Drupal level. Some common FAQs about the CloudFlare Drupal Extension:</p>
	<h4>What does the Drupal extension do?</h4>
	<p>The extension restores the original visitor IP at the Drupal level. Before the extension was available, your logs would reflect CloudFlare's proxy IP addresses.</p>
	<h4>Where can I find the installation directions for the Drupal Extension?</h4>
	<p>You can find the installation on the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/cloudflare">Drupal.org website</a>.</p>
	<h4>Do I need to install the extension if I have mod_cloudflare installed?</h4>
	<p>You do not need to install the extension if you have already installed <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/resources-downloads">mod_cloudflare</a> on your server. It is recommended that you install both if you need original visitor IP at both the Drupal and server level.</p>
	<h4>What version of Drupal is the extension compatible with?</h4>
	<p>The extension has known compatibility with Drupal 6. Drupal 7 is still under development.</p>
	<h4>Does the Drupal extension have the same features as the CloudFlare WordPress plugin?</h4>
	<p>The Drupal extension does not have the same spam reporting capabilities or database optimization features found in the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/resources-downloads">CloudFlare WordPress plugin</a>. However, the Drupal plug-in will continue to develop to include additional features.</p>
	<h4>Are there other things I should know about using CloudFlare and Drupal?</h4>
	<p>A CloudFlare customer wrote up a helpful guide to what they found to be <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1112236">best practices using Drupal with CloudFlare</a>.</p>
	<p>A shout out to Brian for bringing this extension to the CloudFlare and Drupal community. If you are interested in contributing to the Drupal extension, we'd love to hear from you. <a href="mailto:support@cloudflare.com">Send us a note</a>.</p>
