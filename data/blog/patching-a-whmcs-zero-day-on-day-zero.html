	<p>A critical zero-day vulnerability was published today affecting any hosting provider using WHMCS. As part of building a safer web, CloudFlare has added a ruleset to our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a> to block the published attack vector. Hosting partners running their WHMCS behind CloudFlare's WAF can enable the WHMCS Ruleset and implement&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-prevention-protecting-the-origin">best practices</a> to be fully protected from the attack.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Our friends at WHMCS quickly published a patch here: <a href="http://blog.whmcs.com/?t=79427">blog.whmcs.com/?t=79427</a></p>
	<p>CloudFlare recommends applying the patch for your current version of WHMCS or updating WHMCS to version 5.2.8 to close this vulnerability.</p>
