He was the<br>\nfirst community manager at PayPal, including living through the eBay<br>\nacquisition. More recently he evangalized for SimplyHired and Mint.com<br>\n(including taking them through their launch at TechCrunch40). Having a<br>\ncommunity that works together to identify new threats as they arise is<br>\ncritical for Cloudflare and we couldn't be more thrilled to have someone with his background joining our team.</p>\n<p>You will see Damon in the Cloudflare <a href=\"http://support.cloudflare.com/\">Knowledge Base</a> and on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/cloudflare\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/cloudflare\">Facebook</a> too.</p>\n<p>Damon has an infectious energy, so we are excited to have him on-board.
