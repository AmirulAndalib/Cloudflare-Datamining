	<p>When we announced Cloudflare Pages as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-ga/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20we%20announced%20the,powerful%20tool%20in%20developers'%20hands.">generally available</a> in April, we promised you it was just the beginning. The journey of our platform started with support for static sites with small bits of dynamic functionality like setting <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/custom-headers-for-pages">redirects and custom headers</a>. But we wanted to give even more power to you and your teams to begin building the unimaginable. We envisioned a future where your entire application — frontend, APIs, storage, data — could all be deployed with a single commit, easily testable in staging and requiring a single merge to deploy to production. So in the spirit of “Full Stack” Week, we’re bringing you the tools to do just that.</p>
	<p>Welcome to the future, everyone. We’re thrilled to announce that Pages is now a Full Stack platform with help from <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/?_bt=521144407143&amp;_bk=&amp;_bm=b&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=123914288844&amp;_placement=&amp;_target=&amp;_loc=9067609&amp;_dv=c&amp;awsearchcpc=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3eyQsvbPzy3y3BOeCnYZMDVjSd8QkaoPbOfFiFWxSK8zEm9lSCNAJsaAnfkEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Cloudflare Workers</a>!</p>
	<h2>But how?</h2>
	<p>It works the exact same way Pages always has: write your code, <code>git push</code> to your git provider (<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-partners-with-gitlab">now supporting GitLab</a>!) and we’ll deploy your entire site for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend but your backend too using Cloudflare Workers to help deploy serverless functions.</p>
	<h3>The integration you’ve been waiting for</h3>
	<p>Cloudflare Workers provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. Before today, it was <i>possible</i> to connect Workers to a Pages project—installing Wrangler and manually deploying a Worker by writing your app in both Pages and Workers. But we didn’t just want “possible”, we wanted something that came as second nature to you so you wouldn’t have to think twice about adding dynamic functionality to your site.</p>
	<h2>How it works</h2>
	<p>By using your repo’s filesystem convention and exporting one or more function handlers, Pages can leverage Workers to deploy serverless functions on your behalf. To begin, simply add a <code>./functions</code> directory in the root of your project, and inside a JavaScript or TypeScript file, export a function handler. For example, let’s say in your <code>./functions</code> directory, you have a file, <code>hello.js</code>, containing:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">// GET requests to /filename would return "Hello, world!"
export const onRequestGet = () =&gt; {
  return new Response("Hello, world!")
}

// POST requests to /filename with a JSON-encoded body would return "Hello, <name>!"
export const onRequestPost = async ({ request }) =&gt; {
  const { name } = await request.json()
  return new Response(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}</name></code></pre>
	<p>If you perform a <code>git commit</code>, it will trigger a new Pages build to deploy your dynamic site! During the build pipeline, Pages traverses your directory, mapping the filenames to URLs relative to your repo structure.</p>
	<p>Under the hood, Pages generates Workers which include all your routing and functionality from the source. &nbsp;Functions supports deeply-nested routes, wildcard matching, middleware for things like authentication and error-handling, and more! To demonstrate all of its bells and whistles, we’ve created a blog post to walk through an <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-full-stack-with-pages">example full stack application</a>.</p>
	<h2>Letting you do what you do best</h2>
	<p>As your site grows in complexity, with Pages’ new full stack functionality, your developer experience doesn’t have to. You can enjoy the workflow you know and love while unlocking even more depth to your site.</p>
	<h3>Seamlessly build</h3>
	<p>In the same way we’ve handled builds and deployments with your static sites — with a <code>git commit</code> and <code>git push</code> — we’ll deploy your functions for you automatically. As long as your directory follows the proper structure, Pages will identify and deploy your functions to our network with your site.</p>
	<h3>Define your bindings</h3>
	<p>While bringing your Workers to Pages, bindings are a big part of what makes your application a <b><i>full stack</i></b> application**.** We’re so excited to bring to Pages all the bindings you’ve previously used with regular Workers!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><b>KV namespace:</b> Our serverless and globally accessible key-value storage solution. Within Pages, you can integrate with any of the KV namespaces you set in your Workers dashboard for your Pages project.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Durable Object namespace:</b> Our strongly consistent coordination primitive that makes connecting WebSockets, handling state and building entire applications a breeze. As with KV, you can set your namespaces within the Workers dashboard and choose from that list within the Pages interface.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>R2 (coming soon!):</b> Our S3-compatible <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-object-storage">Object Storage</a> solution that’s slashing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-are-data-egress-fees">egress fees</a> to zero.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Environment Variable: </b> An injected value that can be accessed by your functions and is stored as plain-text. You can set your environment variables directly within the Pages interface for both your production and preview environments at build-time and run-time.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Secret (coming soon!): </b> An encrypted environment variable, which cannot be viewed by wrangler or any dashboard interfaces. Secrets are a great home for sensitive data including passwords and API tokens.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Preview deployments — now for your backend too</h3>
	<p>With the deployment of your serverless functions, you can still enjoy the ease of collaboration and testing like you did previously. Before you deploy to production, you can easily deploy your project to a preview environment to stage your changes. Even with your functions, Pages lets you keep a version history of every commit with a unique URL for each, making it easy to gather feedback whether it’s from a fellow developer, PM, designer or marketer! You can also enjoy the same infinite staging privileges that you did for static sites, with a consistent URL for the latest changes.</p>
	<h3>Develop and preview locally too</h3>
	<p>However, we realize that building and deploying with every small change just to stage your changes can be cumbersome at times if you’re iterating quickly. You can now develop full stack Pages applications with the latest release of our wrangler CLI. Backed by Miniflare, you can run your entire application locally with support for mocked secrets, environment variables, and KV (Durable Objects support coming soon!). Point wrangler at a directory of static assets, or seamlessly connect to your existing tools:</p>
	<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh"># Install wrangler v2 beta
npm install wrangler@beta

# Serve a folder of static assets
npx wrangler pages dev ./dist

# Or automatically proxy your existing tools
npx wrangler pages dev -- npx react-scripts start</code></pre>
	<p>This is just the beginning of Pages' integrations with wrangler. Stay tuned as we continue to enhance your developer experience.</p>
	<h2>What else can you do?</h2>
	<p>Everything you can do with HTTP Workers today!</p>
	<p>When deploying a Pages application with functions, Pages is compiling and deploying first class Workers on your behalf. This means there is zero functionality loss when deploying a Worker within your Pages application — instead, there are only new benefits to be gained!</p>
	<h3>Integrate with SvelteKit — out of the box!</h3>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/kit">SvelteKit</a> is a web framework for building Svelte applications. It’s built and maintained by the Svelte team, which makes it the Svelte user’s go-to solution for all their application needs. Out of the box, SvelteKit allows users to build projects with complex API backends.</p>
	<p>As of today, SvelteKit projects can attach and configure the <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/kit"><code>@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare</code></a> package. After doing this, the project can be added to Pages and is ready for its first deployment! With Pages, your SvelteKit project(s) can deploy with API endpoints and full server-side rendering support. Better yet, the entire project — including the API endpoints — can enjoy the benefits of preview deployments, too! This, even on its own, is a huge victory for advanced projects that were previously on the Workers adapter. Check out this <a href="https://github.com/lukeed/pages-fullstack">example to see the SvelteKit adapter</a> for Pages in action!</p>
	<h3>Use server-side rendering</h3>
	<p>You are now able to intercept any request that comes into your Pages project. This means that you can define Workers logic that will receive incoming URLs and, instead of serving static HTML, your Worker can render fresh HTML responses with dynamic data.</p>
	<p>For example, an application with a product page can define a single <code>product/[id].js</code> file that will receive the <code>id</code> parameter, retrieve the product information from a Workers KV binding, and then generate an HTML response for that page. Compared to a static-site generator approach, this is more succinct and easier to maintain over time since you do not need to build a static HTML page <i>per product</i> at build-time… which may potentially be tens or even hundreds of thousands of pages!</p>
	<h2>Already have a Worker? We’ve got you!</h2>
	<p>If you already have a single Worker and want to bring it right on over to Pages to reap the developer experience benefits of our platform, our announcement today also enables you to do precisely that. Your build can generate an ES module Worker called <code>_worker.js</code> in the output directory of your project, perform your git commands to deploy, and we’ll take care of the rest! This can be especially advantageous to you if you’re a framework author or have a more complex use case that doesn’t follow our provided file structure.</p>
	<h2>Try it at no cost — for a limited time only</h2>
	<p>We’re thrilled to be releasing our open beta today for everyone to try at no additional cost to your Cloudflare plan. While we will still have <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions#pricing-and-limits">limits</a> in place, we are using this open beta period to learn more about how you and your teams are deploying functions with your Pages projects. For the time being, we encourage you to lean into your creativity and build out that site you’ve been thinking about for a long time — without the worry of getting billed.</p>
	<p>In just a few short months, when we announce General Availability, you can expect our billing to reflect that of the Workers Bundled plan — after all, these are just Workers under the hood!</p>
	<h2>Coming up…</h2>
	<p>As we’re only announcing this release as an open beta, we have some really exciting things planned for the coming weeks and months. We want to improve on the quick and easy Pages developer experience that you're already familiar with by adding support for integrated logging and more analytics for your deployed functions.</p>
	<p>Beyond that, we'll be expanding our first-class support for the next generation of frontend frameworks. As we've shown with SvelteKit, Pages' ability to seamlessly deploy both static and dynamic code together enables unbeatable end-user performance &amp; developer ease, and we're excited to unlock that for more people. Fans of similar frameworks &amp; technologies, such as NextJS, NuxtJS, React Server Components, Remix, Hydrogen, etc., stay tuned to this blog for more announcements. Or better yet, come <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/careers">join us</a> and help make it happen!</p>
	<p>Additionally, as we’ve done with SvelteKit, we’re looking to include more first-class integration with existing frameworks, so Pages can become the primary home for your preferred frameworks of choice. Work is underway on making NextJS, NuxtJS, React Server Components, Shopify Hydrogen and more integrate seamlessly as you develop your full stack apps.</p>
	<p>Finally, we’re working to speed up those build times, so you can focus on pushing changes and iterating quickly — without the wait!</p>
