Based on the data we collect from our network, as well as reports from other organizations monitoring network routes, it appears that someone systematically withdrew the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routes from the country's border routers. This is the same technique that was used to withdraw Syrian Internet access <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-syria-turned-off-the-internet">last November</a>.</p>
