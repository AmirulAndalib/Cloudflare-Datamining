	<p>Matthew and Michelle, co-founders of Cloudflare, published their <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-annual-founders-letter-2023">annual founders’ letter today</a>. The letter ends with a poem written by an AI running using Workers AI on Cloudflare’s global network.</p>
	<p>Here’s the code that wrote the poem. It uses <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-ai">Workers AI</a> and the Meta <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama">Llama 2 model with 7B parameters and 8-bit integers</a>. Just 14 lines of code running on the Cloudflare global network, and you’ve got your very own <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence">AI</a> to chat with.</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">import { Ai } from "@cloudflare/ai";

export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise&lt;Response&gt; {
        const body = await request.json();
        const ai = new Ai(env.AI);
        const response = await ai.run("@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8", body);
        return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
    },
};

export interface Env {
    AI: any;
}</code></pre>
	<p>That was deployed on Workers AI and all I had to do was ask for poems. Here’s my terminal output (with just the domain name changed).</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">% curl -X POST https://example.com/ -d '{"prompt":"Write a poem \
that talks about the connectivity cloud"}' | jq -r .response</code></pre>
	<p><code>Cloud computing provides a connectivity that's unmatched,</code><code>A bridge that spans the globe with ease and grace.</code><code>It brings us closer, no matter where we are,</code><code>And makes the world a smaller, more intimate place.</code></p>
	<p><code>With just a click, we can connect and share,</code><code>Our thoughts and ideas, our hopes and dreams.</code><code>The cloud unites us, in a way that's fair,</code><code>And makes the world a more harmonious theme.</code></p>
	<p><code>So let us embrace this connectivity,</code><code>And use it to build a better world for all.</code><code>For in the cloud, we find a unity,</code><code>That can help us reach new heights, and stand tall.</code></p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">% curl -X POST https://example.com/ -d '{"prompt":"Write a poem \
that talks about the connectivity cloud and contrast it with the  \
captivity cloud"}' | jq -r .response</code></pre>
	<p><code>The connectivity cloud, a wondrous sight to see,</code><code>Where data flows and knowledge is set free,</code><code>A place where minds meet and ideas take flight,</code><code>A world of endless possibility in sight.</code></p>
	<p><code>But then there's the captivity cloud, a darker place,</code><code>Where thoughts are trapped and minds are in disgrace,</code><code>A prison of the mind, where freedom's lost,</code><code>A world of endless sorrow and cost.</code></p>
	<p><code>So let us choose the connectivity cloud,</code><code>And let our minds be free and allowed,</code><code>To soar and glide and reach for the sky,</code><code>And never be held back, but always fly.</code></p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">% curl -X POST https://example.com/ -d '{"prompt":"Write a poem \
that talks about the connectivity cloud and contrast it with the  \
captivity cloud using Elizabethan English"}' | jq -r .response</code></pre>
	<p><code>In the connectivity cloud, I find my peace,</code><code>Where thoughts and dreams and hopes do cease to flee.</code><code>The captivity cloud doth but darken my day,</code><code>With chains of sorrow that will not away.</code></p>
	<p><code>In the connectivity cloud, I find my home,</code><code>Where love and joy and laughter do make their moan.</code><code>The captivity cloud doth but lock me in,</code><code>With sorrow's shackles that will not give in.</code></p>
	<p><code>In the connectivity cloud, I find my fate,</code><code>Where fortune smiles and misery doth wait.</code><code>The captivity cloud doth but bring me woe,</code><code>With darkness that will not let me go.</code></p>
	<p><code>In the connectivity cloud, I find my heart,</code><code>Where love and hope and joy do play their part.</code><code>The captivity cloud doth but tear it apart,</code><code>With sorrow's hand that will not let it start.</code></p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">% curl -X POST https://example.com/ -d '{"prompt":"Write a poem \
that talks about the connectivity cloud and contrast it with the  \
captivity cloud in the style of Lord Byron"}' | jq -r .response</code></pre>
	<p><code>In the realm of the cloud, where data reigns supreme,</code><code>A new divide has emerged, a digital dream,</code><code>The connectivity cloud, a place of delight,</code><code>Where knowledge and wisdom take flight.</code></p>
	<p><code>But then there's the captivity cloud, a darker hue,</code><code>Where privacy and security are hard to pursue,</code><code>A prison of sorts, where freedom's light is lost,</code><code>And data's secrets are forever crossed.</code></p>
	<p><code>Yet still, we cling to the captivity cloud,</code><code>For in its depths, we find a measure of proof,</code><code>That though the connectivity cloud may be bright,</code><code>The captivity cloud holds a certain allure in sight.</code></p>
	<p><code>So let us embrace both, the light and the dark,</code><code>For in their union, we find a digital spark,</code><code>That illuminates the path to a brighter day,</code><code>Where knowledge and privacy reign in a digital way.</code></p>
	<p>What are you going to build on Workers AI? It’s ready and waiting. We’ll help you go from idea to deployed in minutes.</p>
