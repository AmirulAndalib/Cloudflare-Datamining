	<h3>A Time Machine for Your Website</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/codeguard">CodeGuard</a> takes a compelling idea -- automatic website backup -- and makes it happen without further thought. That peace of mind keeps site owners sleeping easily, and it's just the most compelling of the service's offerings. We're thrilled to add this <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps">CloudFlare App</a> to cover another angle of smooth site operation.</p>
	<p>CodeGuard takes backups only when the code on your site changes, and gives you the chance to scroll through old copies of site code. In conventional "Backup Mode," CodeGuard can capture your existing live site on hourly, daily, or monthly basis, storing each sweep as a different version. They call this "<b>Undo Power</b>" to helping you recover from lost data or untoward changes.</p>
	<h3>Special Offering for CloudFlare Customers</h3>
	<p>CodeGuard created a special <b>free plan for CloudFlare customer: Basic</b><b>Plus</b>. Without spending a cent, you may back up a single site up to 1GB in size. For additional sites, or for larger sites, this valuable service costs only $10/month. Thank you, CodeGuard!</p>
