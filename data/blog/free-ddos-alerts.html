	<p>Weâ€™re excited to announce that customers using our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free">Free plan</a> can now get real-time alerts about HTTP DDoS attacks that were automatically detected and mitigated by Cloudflare. The real-time DDoS alerts were originally announced over a year ago but were made available to customers on the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans">Pro plan or higher</a>. This announcement extends the DDoS alerts feature to Free plan users. You can read the original announcement blog post <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-ddos-alerts">here</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="what-is-a-ddos-attack">What is a DDoS attack?</h3>
	<p>A <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack</a> is a cyber-attack that attempts to disrupt your online business. Whether your business relies on VoIP servers, UDP-based gaming servers, or HTTP servers, DDoS attacks can be used to disrupt any type of Internet property, server, or network.</p>
	<p>In this blog post, weâ€™ll focus on DDoS attacks that target HTTP servers. Whether your HTTP server is powering a mobile app, an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce">eCommerce website</a>, an API gateway, or any other HTTP application, if an attacker sends you more requests than it can handle, your server won't be able to serve your real users. A flood of requests can cause service disruptions or even take your entire server offline. DDoS attacks can have real-world consequences such as a blow to your <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization">revenue</a> and reputation.</p>
	<h3 id="how-cloudflare-detects-and-mitigates-ddos-attacks">How Cloudflare detects and mitigates DDoS attacks</h3>
	<p>Protecting your server against DDoS attacks requires two main capabilities:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The bandwidth to absorb both your usersâ€™ requests and the attack requests</li>
		<li>The ability to differentiate between your usersâ€™ requests and the attack requests</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Using our home-grown systems, we do just that, regardless of the size, frequency and duration of the attacks. All Cloudflare customers, including those using the Free plan, are protected by our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unmetered-mitigation">unmetered DDoS mitigation commitment</a>.</p>
	<p>To protect against DDoS attacks, first, we route your traffic to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network">our network of data centers</a>. Our network spans more than 250 cities in over 100 countries around the world. Its capacity is over 100 Tbps â€” fifty times larger than <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-blocks-an-almost-2-tbps-multi-vector-ddos-attack">the largest attack weâ€™ve ever seen</a>. Our bandwidth is more than enough to absorb both your usersâ€™ traffic and attack traffic.</p>

	<h3 id="cloudflare-s-global-network">Cloudflareâ€™s global network</h3>
	<p>Second, once your traffic reaches our data centers, it goes through state-of-the-art analysis mechanisms that constantly scan for DDoS attacks. Once an attack is detected, a real-time mitigation rule is automatically generated to surgically mitigate the attack requests based on the attack pattern, whilst leaving your users' requests untouched. Using the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/http">HTTP DDoS Managed Ruleset</a> you can customize the settings of the mitigation system to tailor it to your needs and specific traffic patterns.</p>

	<p>Not sure what to do? Thatâ€™s ok. For the most part, you wonâ€™t need to do anything and our system will automatically keep your servers protected. You can read more about it in our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/get-started">Get Started guide</a> or in the original <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-ddos-managed-rules">blog post</a>.

	<h3 id="configuring-a-ddos-alert">Configuring a DDoS alert</h3>
	<p>Once our system detects and mitigates a DDoS attack, youâ€™ll receive a real-time alert. To receive an alert, make sure you, first, configure a notification policy by following these steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Log in to the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/login">Cloudflare dashboard</a> and select your account.</li>
		<li>In the Home Screen, go to <strong>Notifications.</strong></li>
		<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> and choose the <strong>HTTP DDoS Attack Alerter</strong>.</li>
		<li>Give your alert a name, an optional description, add the recipients' email addresses and click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Cloudflareâ€™s mission is to help build a better Internet, and it guides everything we do. As part of this mission, we believe that a better Internet is one where <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos">enterprise-grade DDoS protection</a> is available for everyone, not just bigger organizations.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, weâ€™ve also made our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-ddos-managed-rules">DDoS Managed Ruleset</a> available for everyone to make sure that even non-paying customers can tailor and optimize their DDoS protection settings. Taking a step further, we want all of our users to be able to react as fast as possible when needed. This is why weâ€™re providing real-time alerts for free. Knowledge is power, and notifying our users of attacks in real-time empowers them to ensure their website is safe, available, and performant.</p>
