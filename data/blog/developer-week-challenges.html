	<p>Welcome to Developer Week at Cloudflare! We are excited to announce we are running a series of Developer Challenges throughout the week to give you the excuse you needed to play with all our new features.</p>
	<p>Between now and April 19 youâ€™ll get to know the Cloudflare developer tools and walk away with a fun new app (or five) to your name. Youâ€™ll also become a part of the Cloudflare Developer community!</p>
	<p>We hope that some of you will be inspired to create your next project using <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Workers,</a> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/workers-kv">Workers KV</a>, <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Pages</a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects">Durable Objects</a> and all the developer-focussed products that Cloudflare offers. Thereâ€™s already a vibrant community building applications using the Workers ecosystem; we hope the Developer Challenges inspire you to build on Cloudflare.</p>
	<h2 id="what-are-developer-challenges">What are Developer Challenges?</h2>
	<p>We know that some people are new to the Cloudflare services for developers and that some of you have been using them for a while, so we have come up with two streams of challenges.</p>
	<p>If youâ€™re just getting started with Cloudflare, there will be a new challenge each day of the week that will help you level up your knowledge in no time. Thereâ€™s also an extra bonus challenge over the weekend if youâ€™re feeling inspired.</p>
	<p>For Cloudflareâ€™s current power users, there are two challenges â€” one for the week and one for the weekend. Both are designed to build upon your current knowledge and have some fun with.</p>
	<h2 id="why-participate">Why Participate?</h2>
	<p>The Cloudflare Developer Challenges give you a great opportunity to try out Cloudflare products in a guided manner. They start off with the basics and gradually get more complex. But donâ€™t worry â€” there is a great community on our Discord server that will help answer any questions you may have along the way.</p>
	<p>This is also an opportunity to connect with like-minded people and hear how some of our power users are making the most of whatâ€™s on offer.</p>
	<p>We are really excited to see what youâ€™ll build, and canâ€™t wait to share it with our community on Cloudflare TV!</p>
