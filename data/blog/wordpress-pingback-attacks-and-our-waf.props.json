A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback\">pingback</a> is a way of one website telling another that it has linked to their content. We’ve seen this attack in the past and already had WAF rules in place to block it.</p>\n<p>WordPress exposes an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC#PHP\">XMLRPC</a> endpoint - xmlrpc.php - which other sites can make POST requests to in a standard format to inform a blog that their content has been linked to. The message it sends contains the blog link they referred to, and the page on which they placed that link.</p>\n<p>When WordPress receives a pingback, it makes a request back to the source page to check that the link is actually there. Attackers can use this mechanism to specify a genuine link on a WordPress site and an intended victim, which will trigger a HTTP request to the victim's site. You can think of this as a kind of HTTP Reflection attack, in that the attacker can send a relatively small request to an XMLRPC endpoint that supports pingbacks, and trigger a much larger amount of effort and response on the victim's server.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, our WordPress WAF rule WP0001 &quot;WordPress Pingback Blocker&quot; will immediately stop your WordPress blog from being used for this type of pingback abuse. If you run WordPress, you may want to consider enabling this today.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"CloudFlare WAF rules for WordPress\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/cloudflare_waf_wordpress_ruleset_1.png\"><noscript><img alt=\"CloudFlare WAF rules for WordPress\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/cloudflare_waf_wordpress_ruleset_1.png\"></noscript></p>\n<p>You can find the “CloudFlare WordPress” ruleset under the CloudFlare Settings &gt; Security &gt; Manage WAF section, toggle the switch to turn the CloudFlare Wordpress ruleset on, and you’re all set.</p>\n<p>For an added sting in the tail, the attack Sucuri observed also used a mutating query string when specifying a URL on which they had placed a link. This bogus mutating URL will neutralise most caches and means a server has to expend the effort of producing a page from scratch over and over again. Fortunately we also have CloudFlare WordPress rule 100000 &quot;WordPress Numbers Botnet&quot; which will block this type of behaviour.</p>\n<p>So whether your blog is used to attack others or to be attacked itself, our WAF can help.
