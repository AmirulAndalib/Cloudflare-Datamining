	<p>Last year, Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-partners-a-new-program-with-new-partners/">announced</a> the planned expansion of our partner program to help managed, and professional service partners efficiently engage with Cloudflare and join us in our mission to help build a better Internet. Today, we want to highlight some of those amazing partners and our growing support and training for MSPs around the globe. We want to make sure service partners have the enablement and resources they need to bring a more secure and performant Internet experience to their customers. </p>
	<p>This partner program tier is specifically designed for professional service firms and Managed Service Providers (MSPs and MSSPs) that want to build value-added services and support Cloudflare customers. While Cloudflare is hyper-focused on building highly scalable and easy to use products, we recognize that some customers may want to engage with a professional services firm to assist them in maximizing the value of our offerings. From building Cloudflare Workers, implementing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/load-balancing-multi-cloud-hybrid-cloud/" target="_blank">multi-cloud load balancing</a>, or managing WAF and DDoS events, our partner training and support enables sales and technical teams to position and support the Cloudflare platform as well as enhance their services businesses. </p>
	<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
	<p>Our training and certification is meant to help partners through each stage of Cloudflare adoption, from discovery and sale to implementation, operation and continuous optimization. The program includes hands-on education, partner support and success resources, and access to account managers and partner enablement engineers. &nbsp;</p>

	<h2 id="partner-showcase-zilker-technology">Partner Showcase - Zilker Technology</h2>
	<p>We wanted to highlight the success of one of our managed service partners who, together with Cloudflare, is delivering a more secure, more high performing and more reliable Internet experience for customers.<br></p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wQ-K2WfMpK5uU4YNTh_S8U-Pqp5rDOQK4nWnlk5gKci3PEPHLe3mhW8ml5T6oRMQr8EDSt2voSVJ_UpGWWRetYddreM5kKOp3Ltj17mGB6qAj0bbiRwYYTQJ5oix1v3O7SKnDSw3" class="kg-image"></figure>
	<p><a href="https://ztech.io/" target="_blank">Zilker Technology</a> engaged Cloudflare when one of their eCommerce clients, the retail store of a major NFL team, was facing carding attacks and other malicious activity on their sites. "Our client activated their Cloudflare subscription on a Thursday, and we were live with Cloudflare in production the following Tuesday, ahead of Black Friday later that same week," says Drew Harris, Director of Managed Services for Zilker. "It was crazy fast and easy!"</p>
	<blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding_(fraud)" target="_blank">Carding</a> - also known as credit card stuffing, fraud or verification, happens when cyber criminals attempt to make small purchases with large volumes of stolen credit card numbers on one eCommerce platform.</blockquote>
	<p>In addition to gaining the enhanced security and protection from Cloudflare WAF, advanced DDOS protection, and rate-limiting, Zilker replaced the client's legacy CDN with Cloudflare CDN, improving site performance and user experience. Zilker provides full-stack managed services and 24/7 support for the client, including Cloudflare monitoring and management. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>“Partnering with Cloudflare gives us peace of mind that we can deliver on customer expectations of security and performance all the time, every day. Even as new threats emerge, Cloudflare is one step ahead of the game,” says Matthew Fox, VP of Business Development. </p>
	<h2 id="just-getting-started">Just getting started</h2>
