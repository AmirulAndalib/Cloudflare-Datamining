	<p>Cloudflare’s network spans more than 310 cities in over 120 countries, where we interconnect with over 13,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions.</p>
	<p>During previous quarters, we tracked a number of government directed Internet shutdowns in Iraq, intended to prevent cheating on academic exams. We expected to do so again during the fourth quarter, but there turned out to be no need to, as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#governmentdirected">discussed below</a>. While we didn’t see that set of expected shutdowns, we did observe a number of other Internet outages and disruptions due to a number of commonly seen causes, including <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#fibercabletrouble">fiber/cable issues</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#poweroutages">power outages</a>, extreme <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#weather">weather</a>, infrastructure <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#maintenance">maintenance</a>, general <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#technicalproblems">technical problems</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#cyberattacks">cyberattacks</a>, and unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/#militaryaction">military action</a>. As we have noted in the past, this post is intended as a summary overview of observed disruptions, and is not an exhaustive or complete list of issues that have occurred during the quarter.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

	<h3 id="iraq">Iraq</h3>
	<p>In a slight departure from the usual subject of this blog post, this time we lead off with coverage of government directed Internet shutdowns that didn’t happen. <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/iq">Iraq</a> has been a frequent subject of this series of posts, as they have historically implemented daily multi-hour Internet shutdowns during exam periods, intended to prevent cheating. Earlier this year, there was some hope that this practice might be ending, and in our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q2-2023-internet-disruption-summary">Q2 2023 Internet disruption summary</a> post, we noted “<em>In the weeks prior to the start of this year’s shutdowns, it was <a href="https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/31453-Iraq%E2%80%99s-communication-ministry-refuses-to-enforce-internet-blackout-for-final-exams">reported</a> that the Iraqi Ministry of Communications had announced it had refused a request from the Ministry of Education to impose an Internet shutdown during the exams as part of efforts to prevent cheating. Unfortunately, this refusal was short-lived, with shutdowns ultimately starting two weeks later.</em>” In addition to these second quarter shutdowns, they also occurred during the third quarter across multiple weeks in July, August, and September.</p>
	<p>During the fourth quarter, the third round of 12th grade high school final exams was scheduled to begin on November 13 and end on November 21, taking place at 13:00 local time, as shown in the schedule below, which was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=661695112830032&amp;set=pb.100069686486016.-2207520000&amp;type=3">published</a> on the Iraqi Ministry of Education’s Facebook page.</p>

		<figcaption>November 2023 exam schedule in Iraq</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>However, in looking at Internet traffic for Iraq during that period, it appears that the nationwide Internet shutdowns that would have normally taken place did not occur, as the graph shows a very consistent diurnal pattern with no evidence of disruptions to Internet connectivity like we have seen in the past. Additionally, other <a href="https://twitter.com/accessnow">civil society groups</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IODA_live">academic researchers</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dougmadory">Internet analysts</a> that also monitor these shutdowns did not report seeing any related drops in traffic. It is unclear whether a request for shutdowns was submitted by the Ministry of Education and again refused by the Ministry of Communications, or if no request was ever submitted for this round of exams. Regardless, we hope that Iraq continues to keep the Internet connected during future rounds of exams.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://radar.cloudflare.com/embed/TrafficTrendsXY?dateStart=2023-11-12&amp;dateEnd=2023-11-22&amp;location=iq&amp;chartState=%7B%22showAnnotations%22%3Atrue%2C%22xy.hiddenSeries%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22xy.previousVisible%22%3Atrue%7D" title="Cloudflare Radar - Internet traffic trends" loading="lazy"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

	<h3 id="palestine">Palestine</h3>
	<p>On Saturday, October 7, 2023, attacks from the Palestinian group Hamas launched from the Gaza Strip against the south of Israel started a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2023_Gaza%E2%88%92Israel_conflict">conflict</a> in the region, with Israel <a href="https://apnews.com/live/israel-hamas-war-live-updates#0000018b-0f83-d2a1-a1df-8fcb0a320000">officially declaring</a> the next day that it was at war. This had an almost immediate impact on Internet traffic in both <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/il">Israel</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ps">Palestine</a>, with traffic in the former showing ~170% growth as compared to the prior week, and ~100% growth in the latter as compared to the previous week. These trends are discussed in our October 9 blog post, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-traffic-patterns-in-israel-and-palestine-following-the-october-2023-attacks"><em>Internet traffic patterns in Israel and Palestine following the October 2023 attacks</em></a>.</p>
	<p>However, in the hours and days following the initial attacks, a number of Palestinian Internet providers saw traffic fall significantly, with many winding up largely or totally offline, potentially as a result of power outages caused by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2">retaliatory Israeli airstrikes</a>.

	<h3 id="chad">Chad</h3>
	<p>On December 7 &amp; 8, a near-complete outage observed in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/td">Chad</a> was <a href="https://www.msn.com/fr-xl/actualite/other/tchad-connexion-internet-r%C3%A9tablie-apr%C3%A8s-des-heures-de-coupure/ar-AA1lcaMM">reportedly</a> due to fiber optic cable cuts in neighboring countries. A published article cited <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as328594">SudaChad</a> as claiming that the outage seen in the graphs below was due to an issue with CAMTEL, a <a href="https://www.camertoday.com/camtel-and-sudachad-assess-relationship-pledge-further-commitment-for-better-results">Cameroonian partner</a>.

Since simultaneous cuts in fiber optic cables in Chad’s two neighboring countries would certainly be an unusual occurrence, it isn’t clear if such an event happened, though <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as328594">routing data for SudaChad</a> shows that the network’s two upstream providers are <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as15706">AS15706 (Sudatel)</a> in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/sd">Sudan</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as15964">AS15964 (CAMNET)</a> in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/cm">Cameroon</a>.

	<p>Ukrainian Internet provider Kyivstar <a href="https://twitter.com/TwiyKyivstar/status/1734527519972298888">announced</a> on the morning of December 12 that they were the “target of a powerful hacker attack”. They noted that the attack caused a “technical failure” that resulted in mobile communication and Internet access becoming temporarily unavailable. Although <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as15895">Kyivstar</a> has been targeted by around <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/ukraine-s-main-phone-operator-recovering-two-days-after-cyberattack-41ba9ee3">500 cyberattacks</a> since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, this was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/ukraines-kyivstar-restores-services-after-cyberattack-parent-veon-says-2023-12-19">reportedly</a> the largest attack to date.

In addition to catastrophic structural damage, it was <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/hurricane-otis-causes-catastrophic-damage-acapulco-mexico">reported</a> that “<em>more than 10,000 utility poles were destroyed, knocking out power and internet/communications across the region, while numerous transmission lines, electrical substations, and a power plant were also heavily damaged.</em>” This damage to electrical and communications infrastructure in the area resulted in significant disruption to Internet connectivity. As shown in the graph below, Internet traffic from Acapulco dropped by around 80% as Otis made landfall. Traffic started to show some growth in early November, but peak volumes remained relatively consistent, and well below pre-hurricane levels, through the end of the year. (Several large spikes are visible on December 26 &amp; 30, but it isn’t clear what those are associated with.) Although Acapulco’s tourism industry <a href="https://bnnbreaking.com/world/mexico/acapulcos-resilience-from-hurricane-devastation-to-holiday-destination">experienced a notable recovery</a> heading into the end of the year, it appears that infrastructure recovery has not been quite as swift.</p>

	<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Within the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#internet-outages">Cloudflare Radar 2023 Year in Review</a>, we highlighted over 180 major Internet disruptions that were observed year-to-date through the end of November, though the actual number was likely closer to 200 by the end of the year. While that may seem like a lot, it is worth nothing that the actual number is even higher, as these posts are not exhaustive in their coverage of such events. For example, while we covered the Internet shutdown in Manipur, India that took place across multiple months in 2023, <a href="https://internetshutdowns.in">internetshutdowns.in</a> shows that over 90 more smaller localized shutdowns were put into place across the country.</p>
	<p>In addition, 2024 is shaping up to be an important year for elections, with voting taking place in more than <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/12/2024-elections-around-world">50 countries around the world</a>. Unfortunately, some countries have taken to implementing Internet shutdowns or otherwise disrupting Internet connectivity during elections. The <a href="https://freedomonlinecoalition.com/joint-statement-internet-shutdowns-and-elections">Freedom Online Coalition’s Joint Statement on Internet Shutdowns and Elections</a> details the detrimental effects of such actions. The Cloudflare Radar team will be monitoring for election-related Internet shutdowns, sharing our observations on the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</a>, via social media, and in posts on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/cloudflare-radar">blog.cloudflare.com</a>.</p>
