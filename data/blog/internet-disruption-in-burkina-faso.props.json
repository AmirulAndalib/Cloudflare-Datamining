As of today, there are three countries affected by major Internet disruptions — Tonga and Yemen are the others.</p><p><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/bf?date_filter=last_7_days\">Cloudflare Radar</a> shows that Internet traffic dropped significantly in the West African country after ~09:15 UTC (the same in local time) and remains low more than 24 hours later. Burkina Faso also had a mobile <a href=\"https://afriksoir.net/actualite/burkina-faso-internet-encore-coupe-au-lendemain-sommet-cedeao/\">Internet shutdown</a> on January 10, 2022, and another we <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/burkina-faso-internet-shutdown/\">reported</a> in late November 2021.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image4-15.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image2-23.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The main ISPs from Burkina Faso were affected. The two leading Internet Service Providers Orange and FasoNet lost Internet traffic after 09:15 UTC, but also Telecel Faso, as the next chart shows. This morning, at around 10:00 UTC there was some traffic from FasoNet but less than half of what we saw at the same time in preceding days.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image5-15.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>It’s not only mobile traffic that is affected. Desktop traffic is also impacted. In Burkina Faso, our data shows that mobile devices normally represent 70% of Internet traffic.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image3-26.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>With the Burkina Faso disruption, three countries are currently mostly without access to the Internet for different reasons.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/ye\">Yemen</a>, as we <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-outage-in-yemen-amid-airstrikes/\">reported</a>, the four day-long outage is related to airstrikes that affected a telecommunications building in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hudaydah\">Al-Hudaydah</a> where the <a href=\"https://www.submarinenetworks.com/en/systems/asia-europe-africa/falcon\">FALCON undersea cable</a> lands.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image6-16.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/to?date_filter=last_30_days\">Tonga</a>, the nine day-long outage that we <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tonga-internet-outage/\">also explained</a> is related to problems in the undersea cable caused by the large <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Hunga_Tonga_eruption_and_tsunami\">volcanic eruption</a> in the South Pacific archipelago.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image1-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Several significant Internet disruptions have already occurred in 2022 for different reasons:</p><p>1. An Internet outage that lasted a few hours in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-gambia-without-internet/\">The Gambia</a> because of a cable problem (on January 4).<br>2. A six days Internet shutdown in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-shut-down-in-kazakhstan-amid-unrest/\">Kazakhstan</a> because of unrest (from January 5 to January 11).<br>3. A <a href=\"https://afriksoir.net/actualite/burkina-faso-internet-encore-coupe-au-lendemain-sommet-cedeao/\">mobile</a> Internet shutdown in <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/bf?date_filter=last_30_days\">Burkina Faso</a> because of a coup plot (on January 10).<br>4. An <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tonga-internet-outage/\">Internet outage</a> in <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/to\">Tonga</a> because of a volcanic eruption (ongoing since January 15).<br>5.

This second Internet disruption in <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/bf\">Burkina Faso</a> is related to military unrest (ongoing since January 23).</p><p>You can keep an eye on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> to monitor the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/bf\">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/ye\">Yemen</a> and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/to\">Tonga</a> situations as they unfold.</p><h3 id=\"update-january-25-2022\"><strong>UPDATE: January 25, 2022</strong></h3><p>Internet connectivity returned to Burkina Faso last night (January 24, 2022) around 20:00 UTC after a ~35 hour disruption.
