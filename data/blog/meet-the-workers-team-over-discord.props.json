You can join right away by going <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev\">here</a>.</p><p>Through our Discord channel, you can now connect with the team to ask questions, show off what you’re building, and discuss the platform with other developers.</p><p>Sometimes you just need to talk to another human being. Our <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/\">developer docs</a> will always be the source of truth on the mechanics of Workers, but we want to provide quicker help if you need it.</p><h3 id=\"growing-the-workers-community\">Growing The Workers Community</h3><p>Over the past three years, Cloudflare Workers evolved from an initial sandbox for enterprise customers writing edge code to a developer platform for creating new applications and systems.</p><p>“We bet our whole business on Workers and it paid off big time,” said Hamlet Batista, CEO of RankSense, a SEO automation platform. “We've been saving a lot of money on infrastructure costs and DevOps resources we no longer need.”</p><p>Our team is constantly surprised by the palette of use cases from those developing on Workers. For example, a developer in Belgium <a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/built-with/projects/make-facemasks\">created</a> a static Workers site that teaches an online tutorial in three different languages on how to make your own face mask, which earned the approval of the Belgian government.</p><h3 id=\"why-discord\">Why Discord?</h3><p>Discord provides a medium that allows users to openly share their thoughts while maintaining anonymity. It’s also really fast — partially due to Discord’s use of Workers and Cloudflare’s network.</p><p>“Workers are in the path of virtually all Discord requests,” said Mark Smith, Director of Infrastructure at Discord. “We are longtime users of Workers and big fans of the power and flexibility they give us to continue building great things for our users.”</p><p>As we continue to build the ecosystem of developer tools, we’d love to hear what you’re building, whether it’s a personal site of your pet or an API gateway. Come <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev\">say hi</a> today.</p>",
