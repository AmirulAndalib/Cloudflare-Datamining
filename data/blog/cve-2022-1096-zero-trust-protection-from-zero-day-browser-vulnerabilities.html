	<p>On Friday, March 25, 2022, Google published an <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_25.html?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">emergency security update</a> for all Chromium-based web browsers to patch a high severity vulnerability (CVE-2022-1096). At the time of writing, the specifics of the vulnerability are restricted until the majority of users have patched their local browsers.</p>
	<p>It is important everyone takes a moment to update their local web browser. It’s one quick and easy action everyone can contribute to the cybersecurity posture of their team.<br><br>Even if everyone updated their browser straight away, this remains a reactive measure to a threat that existed before the update was available. Let’s explore how Cloudflare takes a proactive approach by mitigating the impact of zero day browser threats with our zero trust and remote browser isolation services. Cloudflare’s remote browser isolation service is built from the ground up to protect against zero day threats, and all remote browsers on our global network have already been patched.</p>
	<h3 id="how-cloudflare-zero-trust-protects-against-browser-zero-day-threats">How Cloudflare Zero Trust protects against browser zero day threats</h3>
	<p>Cloudflare Zero Trust applies a layered defense strategy to protect users from zero day threats while browsing the Internet:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Cloudflare’s roaming client steers Internet traffic over an encrypted tunnel to a nearby Cloudflare data center for inspection and filtration.</li>
		<li>Cloudflare’s secure web gateway inspects and filters traffic based on our network intelligence, antivirus scanning and threat feeds. Requests to known malicious services are blocked and high risk or unknown traffic is automatically served by a remote browser.</li>
		<li>Cloudflare’s browser isolation service executes all website code in a remote browser to protect unpatched devices from threats inside the unknown website.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 id="protection-from-the-unknown">Protection from the unknown</h3>
	<p>Zero day threats are often exploited and exist undetected in the real world and actively target users through risky links in emails or other external communication points such as customer support tickets. This risk cannot be eliminated, but it can be reduced by using remote browser isolation to minimize the attack surface. Cloudflare’s browser isolation service is built from the ground up to protect against zero day threats:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Prevent compromised web pages from affecting the endpoint device by executing all web code in a remote browser that is physically isolated from the endpoint device. The endpoint device only receives a thin HTML5 remoting shell from our network and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-and-remote-browser-isolation/">vector draw commands</a> from the remote browser.</li>
		<li>Mitigate the impact of compromise by automatically destroying and reconstructing remote browsers back to a known clean state at the end of their browser session.</li>
		<li>Protect adjacent remote browsers by encrypting all remote browser egress traffic, segmenting remote browsers with virtualization technologies and distributing browsers across physical hardware in our global network.</li>
		<li>Aiding Security Incident Response (SIRT) teams by logging all remote egress traffic in the integrated secure web gateway logs.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="patching-remote-browsers-around-the-world">Patching remote browsers around the world</h3>
	<p>Even with all these security controls in place, patching browsers remains critical to eliminate the risk of compromise. The process of patching local and remote browsers tells two different stories that can be the difference between compromise, and avoiding a zero day vulnerability.</p>
	<p>Patching your workforces local browsers requires politely asking users to interrupt their work to update their browser, or apply mobile device management techniques to disrupt their work by forcing an update. Neither of these options create happy users, or deliver rapid mitigation.</p>
	<p>Patching remote browsers is a fundamentally different process. Since the remote browser itself is running on our network, Users and Administrators do not need to intervene as security patches are automatically deployed to remote browsers on Cloudflare’s network. Then without a user restarting their local browser, any traffic to an isolated website is automatically served from a patched remote browser.</p>
	<p>Finally, browser based vulnerabilities such as CVE-2022-1096 are not uncommon. With over 300 in 2021 and over 40 already in 2022 (according to <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/15031/Google-Chrome.html?vendor_id=1224&amp;ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">cvedetails.com</a>) it is critical for administrators to have a plan to rapidly mitigate and patch browsers in their organization.</p>
