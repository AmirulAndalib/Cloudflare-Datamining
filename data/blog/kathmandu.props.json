It’s not even close!</li>\n<li>Nepal has never been conquered or ruled by another country.</li>\n<li>Kathmandu, Nepal is where Cloudflare has placed its 123rd data center.</li>\n<li>Nepal’s timezone is 5 hours 45 minutes ahead of GMT.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mountains\">Mountains</h3>\n<p>The mountainous nation of Nepal is home to Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, known in Nepali as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest\">Sagarmāthā</a>. Most of us learn that at school; however there’s plenty of other mountains located in Nepal. Here’s the ones above 8,000 meters (extracted from the full <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_in_Nepal\">list</a>) to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mount Everest at 8,848 meters</li>\n<li>Kanchenjunga at 8,586 meters</li>\n<li>Lhotse at 8,516 meters</li>\n<li>Makalu at 8,463 meters</li>\n<li>Cho Oyu at 8,201 meters</li>\n<li>Dhaulagiri I at 8,167 meters</li>\n<li>Manaslu at 8,156 meters</li>\n<li>Annapurna I at 8,091 meters</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/02/Annapurna-1.jpg\" alt=\"Annapurna\" loading=\"lazy\"><small>Photo of Annapurna taken outside Pokhara by blog author</small></p>\n<p>As we said, Kathmandu and Nepal are very mountainous region! Some of these mountains are shared with neighboring countries. In-fact, the whole Himalayan range stretches much further than just Nepal as it also encompasses neighboring countries such as Bhutan, China, India, and Pakistan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nepalsflag\">Nepal’s flag</h3>\n<p>The official flag of Nepal is not a rectangle, it’s a very unique shape. No other flag comes close to having this shape. At first viewing it looks simple, just two triangles (representing the Himalayas) placed vertically against the flagpole. Nope - the triangles have a very specific dimension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/02/Flag_of_Nepal.svg\" alt=\"Flag_of_Nepal\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>The flags symbolism goes beyond the mountains. The two white symbols represent the calming moon and fierce sun or sometimes the cool weather in the Himalayas and warm lowlands.</p>\n<p>But back to those two triangles. Ignoring the old adage (&quot;It was my understanding that there would be no <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Chevy_Chase\">math</a>.&quot;), let’s grab what Wikipedia says about the shape of this flag and see if we can follow along.</p>\n<p>First off, let’s explain irrational vs rational numbers (or ratios or fractions). A rational number is a simple P/Q number like 1/2 or 3/4 or 1/5 or even 16/9 etc etc. The numerator and denominator must both be integers. Even 100003/999983 (using prime numbers) is a rational number. If the denominator is 0 then the number isn’t rational.</p>\n<p>An irrational number is everything else. If it can’t be written as P/Q, then it’s irrational. This means a number that doesn’t terminate or doesn’t become periodic. For example, π or Pi (3.141592653589793238462…), e or Euler's Number (2.718281828459045235360…), the square root of 2 (1.414213562373095…), etc. These are all irrational numbers. Don’t be fooled by 4/3. While it’s impossible to full write out (1.33333… continuing forever), yet it’s actually a rational number.</p>\n<p>(Read up about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus\">Hippasus</a>, who’s credited with discovering the existence of irrational numbers, if you want an irrational <a href=\"https://esoterx.com/2014/12/03/murder-by-math-the-irrational-demise-of-hippasus/\">murder story</a>!)</p>\n<p>That’s enough math theory; now back to the Nepali flag. Each red triangle has a rational ratio. The flag is started with simple 1:1 and 3:4 ratios and that’s the easy part. We are all capable of grabbing paper or cloth and make a rectangle that’s 3 inches by 4 inches, or 1.5 meters by 2 meters or any 3:4 ratio. It’s simple math. What gets complicated is adding the blue border. For that, we need to read-up what was said by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS Foundation) and Wikipedia. They both go into <a href=\"https://oeis.org/A230582\">great depth</a> to describe the full mathematical dimensions of the flag. Let’s just paraphrase them slightly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/02/nepal-flag-formula.png\" alt=\"nepal-flag-formula\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>However the math (and geometry) award goes to the work done in order to produce &quot;Calculation of the aspect ratio of the national flag of Nepal&quot;. The final geometric drawing is this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/02/nepal-flag-geometry.png\" alt=\"nepal-flag-geometry\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\n<a href=\"https://0xc.de/flags/nepal/\">Berechnung des Seitenverhältnisses der Nationalfahne von Nepal</a></p>\n<p>Yeah - that’s going a bit too far for a Cloudflare blog! Let’s just say that Nepal’s flag is unique and quite interesting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"apricot2018\">APRICOT 2018</h3>\n<p>We are especially excited to announce our Kathmandu data center while attending <a href=\"https://2018.apricot.net/\">APRICOT</a> conference, being held in Nepal this year. The event, supported by <a href=\"https://conference.apnic.net/45/\">APNIC</a>, the local Regional Internet address Registry (RIR) for the Asia-Pacific region, attracts leaders from Internet industry technical, operational, and policy-making communities. Cloudflare's favorite part of APRICOT is the Peering Forum track on Monday.</p>\n<h3 id=\"saarc\">SAARC</h3>\n<p>Nepal is just one of eight countries making up the <a href=\"http://www.saarc-sec.org/\">SAARC</a> (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) organization. Headquartered in Kathmandu, it comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare has already deployed into neighboring <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-launches-in-india-with-data-centers-in-mumbai-chennai-and-new-delhi/\">India</a>, and any astute reader of these blogs will know we are always working on adding sites where and when we can. The SAARC countries are in our focus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildbuildbuild\">Build, build, build!</h3>\n<p>For Cloudflare‘s next two data centers, we head to a different continent and way-south of the equator. Throughout 2018, we’ll announce a stream of deployments across many different cities that each improve the security and performance of millions of our customers.</p>\n<p>If you’re motivated by the idea of helping build one of the world's largest networks, come <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/\">join our team</a>!</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
