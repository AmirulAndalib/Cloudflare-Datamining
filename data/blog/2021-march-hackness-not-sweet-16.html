	<p>Dick Vitale impression returning in:</p>
	<p><i>3…</i></p>
	<p><i>2…</i></p>
	<p><i>1…</i></p>
	<p>OH MY, WHAT A TOURNAMENT IT HAS BEEN! SOME STUNNING UPSETS! MILLIONS OF BRACKETS BUSTED! IT’S AWESOME (and sometimes awful), BABY!</p>
	<p>Whew… Got that out of the way.</p>
	<p>So, what have we learned from the first two rounds of the Annual March Hackness phishing tournament?</p>
	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has definitely played into what attackers are using in their business.</p>
	<p>The proof? Cinderella runs thus far for some of our (not-so-Sweet) 16 of top-impersonated newcomers: the <b>World Health Organization</b> (which we’ve seen daily in the news); <b>Target</b> (whose online sales surged by $10 billion last year); and <b>DocuSign</b> (whose revenue exploded by nearly 50%, thanks to post-COVID remote business). Reminiscent of Marquette’s 2013 run, in my opinion!</p>
	<p>That said, our major players of <b>Microsoft</b> and <b>Google</b> are still accounted for — they remain attackers’ favorite brands year after year. (Case in point: our security research team <a href="https://threatpost.com/office-365-phishing-attack-financial-execs/164925">recently uncovered</a> a highly sophisticated Microsoft 365 phishing campaign targeting financial departments and unsuspecting assistants and CEOs).</p>
	<p>But … who honestly could have predicted <b>PayPal</b> getting knocked out in the first round? Our 2019 March Hackness Champion goes home early! Congratulations to them for being Most Improved (aka, less spoofed)!</p>
	<p>Remember folks, in our phishing bracket, a first round knockout is actually a badge of honor!</p>
	<p>Which brings us into the Not-So-Sweet 16. Can the WHO continue its historic run? Can Twitter upset the Duke-esque status of Microsoft? Will Facebook survive a matchup against Amazon? Only time will tell!</p>
	<p>The Madness is setting in!</p>
	<p><b><i>Let’s check back with Dicky V for analysis of the perfect phishing bracket:</i></b></p>

	<h3>Some takeaways for the Sweet 16?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>OH BABY! We’ve got quite a few Juggernaut matchups! Microsoft has that champion pedigree but Twitter is a strong contender!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Facebook vs Amazon! That’s a championship matchup in its own right … expect a lot of fireworks there!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>I like Apple’s odds of making it to the finals!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>I think our Cinderella, the WHO, might be making it to the ball!</p>

	<h3>And Now Some Additional Analysis</h3>
	<p>By the way, in case you’re wondering: <i>is email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) THE winning way to stop brand spoofing and impersonation-based phishing attacks from ever reaching inboxes?</i></p>
	<p>The answer is: <b>No.</b> Over the past year, we’ve blocked 22 million of these types of phishing attacks — <b>and while we know all three standards can help with preventing</b> <b><i>some</i></b> <b>forms of phishing, attackers can</b> <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/2153307/lp/3955867/how-bad-actors-get-past-dmarc-in-60-minutes-or-less"><b>easily bypass email authentication</b></a><b>.</b></p>
	<p>The SPF, DKIM and DMARC standards are certainly useful for validating server and tenant origins, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/protect-domains-without-email">protecting message integrity</a> and providing policy enforcement. However, security professionals should know that:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><i>Anyone can set up emails that pass email authentication.</i></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><i>Email authentication does not inspect content.</i></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><i>Email authentication does not protect against look-alike domains</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><i>Email authentication does not protect against compromised domains</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><i>The vast majority of organizations and domains do not use email authentication</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><i>Email authentication can be difficult to set up properly.</i></p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Below is a brief description of what each standard does, what types of threats it can protect against and what types of threats it <i>cannot</i> protect against.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
