	<p>DEX notifications address the challenge of proactively identifying issues affecting the digital experience of your end users. By monitoring device health and conducting synthetic tests from WARP clients deployed on your fleet's end-user devices, DEX provides valuable insights. These notifications empower IT administrators to quickly identify and address connectivity and application performance problems before they impact a wide range of users.</p>
	<p>By proactively notifying administrators when problems arise, DEX helps minimize user disruption and provides peace of mind. Instead of actively refreshing and looking for issues as before, administrators can now receive immediate notifications. Management is simple, as notifications can be easily configured through the <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=%2F%3Aaccount%2Fnotifications"><u>Cloudflare dashboard</u></a>.</p>
	<p>Administrators can now create three new notification types:</p>
	<p><b>1) Device Connectivity Anomaly</b></p>
	<p>Are you tired of manually monitoring your end-users' device connectivity? Do you want to be notified immediately when there's a sudden change? Our new DEX notification for Device Connectivity Anomaly alerts you when there's a significant increase or decrease in the number of monitored devices connecting or disconnecting to the WARP Client. This can be filtered by various characteristics such as data center (“colo”), platform (operating system), and WARP Client version.</p>
	<p>We use a statistical method called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"><u>z-score</u></a> to detect anomalies in monitored device count. A z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. By comparing the current five minutes of data to the past four hours, we can calculate the mean and standard deviation. If the z-score value exceeds 3.5 or falls below -3.5, a notification is triggered.</p>
	<p>Here's an example of a notification configuration for macOS devices in the UK using WARP Client version 2023.7.24:</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

	</figure>
	<p><b>2) DEX Test Latency&nbsp;</b></p>
	<p>Ever worry application performance is slow? We're thrilled to introduce DEX Test Latency notifications, which are designed for administrators who want to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to application performance. This notification proactively alerts you of significant spikes or drops in latency based on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><b>HTTP Test:</b> Resource Fetch Time measures the time it takes for a web browser to retrieve a specific resource from your application and deliver it to the end user.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Traceroute Test:</b> Round Trip Time measures the average time it takes for data packets to travel from your device to a specific destination IP address and back (when successful). Traceroute tests focus on the overall network performance between the test client/device and your application.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This notification can be filtered by various characteristics such as data center (“colo”), platform (operating system), WARP Client version, and test name.</p>
	<p>In this example, you have a DEX test monitoring the latency of the website<a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com"> www.cloudflarestatus.com</a>. This test, named "Cloudflare Status," uses an HTTP GET request and runs on Windows devices connecting through the Lisbon colo (data center).&nbsp;</p>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
		<img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4xCxwfiNdjZCAtxwDnsUV7/629bed0af47e9c8e2eaacd7dbd946b9e/BLOG-2557_4.png" alt="BLOG-2557 4" class="kg-image" width="1999" height="1179" loading="lazy">
	</figure>
	<p><b>3) DEX Test Low Availability</b></p>
	<p>Is application downtime causing headaches for you and your users?&nbsp;</p>
	<p>DEX Test Low Availability notifications help maintain optimal application health by notifying you when availability&nbsp; falls below a given threshold. This notification monitors the success rate of HTTP or Traceroute requests sent to an application through pre-configured DEX tests. These synthetic tests simulate user traffic and measure the percentage of successful interactions with your application.</p>
	<p>You define the Service Level Objective (SLO) — a specific availability threshold — for each notification. When the percentage of successful requests falls below this threshold, you'll receive immediate notification, allowing you to proactively address issues before they impact a wide range of end users.</p>
	<p>This can be filtered by various characteristics such as colo (data center), platform (operating system), WARP Client version, and test name.</p>
	<p>In this example, a DEX test is targeting <a href="https://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>. This Traceroute test runs on Chrome OS devices connecting through the Tel Aviv colo. The example notification is configured to alert you whenever the availability (percentage of successful requests) drops below 98%, allowing you to investigate potential issues and take corrective action quickly.</p>

	<p>In January 2023, we proudly launched <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/china-express"><u>China Express</u></a> with multiple partners in China to extend Cloudflare One into China and provide connectivity to ensure that customers within the country could enjoy the same level of access to global services as the rest of the world. Our goal was simple: to deliver a consistent experience for customers and employees everywhere.</p>
	<p>Over the past year, we've observed a notable increase in demand from enterprise customers seeking secure access to China-hosted sites. These customers, who often require consistent zero trust security policies applied through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/gateway"><u>Cloudflare Gateway</u></a>, including device posture checks, have faced challenges like scenic routing, where Internet traffic passes through multiple countries or networks, leading to significant packet loss when connecting to these websites.</p>

As part of their daily operations, employees need to access websites hosted in mainland China. However, they have experienced unstable connections, particularly when accessing the AWS web console in China. Further investigation revealed long and sometimes unpredictable network routes, contributing to the instability.</p>
	<p>Global Internet traffic to and from China flows through a limited number of international links, tightly regulated by government authorities, often leading to significant instability and fluctuations. To address these challenges, our China Express partners offer the 'Reverse Tunnel' solution, a reliable service that ensures stable access to Chinese websites, effectively mitigating connectivity issues.</p>

	<p>By having companies implement a DNS host override policy in Cloudflare Gateway for origins in China, which routes traffic through the China Express Reverse Tunnel instead of using public Internet routes, companies can ensure more stable and reliable connections for their employees.</p>
	<p>Looking ahead, we remain committed to continuously improving and expanding our offerings within China Express. Future developments may include further enhancements to performance, additional partnerships with local providers, and ongoing innovation to meet the evolving needs of our customers in the region.</p>
