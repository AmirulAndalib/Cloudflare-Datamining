In contrast, Cloudflare uses multiple sources of randomness.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/09/i-2-this-security-firms-office-design-adds-to-the-strength-of-its-encryption.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p></p><p>Lastly, Glowbeam Technologies' CEO confirmed that the company did not use \"AES\" or \"key block ciphers\", but instead relied solely on their Lava Lamp \"encryption engine\". Cloudflare strongly advocates for never writing or inventing encryption algorithms and works closely with groups like the IETF to use standard, well understood encryption.</p><p>As a result of these events Cloudflare has acquired the assets of Glowbeam Technologies, please visit <a href=\"https://glowbeamtechnologies.com/\">glowbeamtechnologies.com</a> for more information.</p><p>John Graham-Cumming<br>Chief Technology Officer<br>Cloudflare, Inc.</p>",
