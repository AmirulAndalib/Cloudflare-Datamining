	<p>Each day, hundreds of thousands of new domains are registered by users around the world. Unfortunately, the simplicity of domain registration makes it simple for attackers to register fraudulent domains for use in phishing campaigns. In fact, according to ICANN, nearly 5.45% of newly registered domains per day are malicious (including phishing, botnets, and malware). This means there are 25,070 newly registered malicious domains per day on average.</p>
	<p>On July 16th, 2020, an email appearing to be from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation was sent to numerous recipients, seeking donations for the Foundation in Bitcoin. The email enticed potential donors by offering to double any donations received within seven days. The sender domain of the email was strikingly similar to the legitimate foundation’s domain, gatesfoundation.org.</p>
	<p><strong>Aside from one letter, the malicious sender domain could easily pass for one belonging to the Gates Foundation.</strong> The attacker cleverly employed typosquatting when creating the domain name, just minutes before sending the email. Without close scrutiny, the domain’s typo is indistinguishable from the legitimate domain. The attacker also set up an SPF record for the domain in order to ensure reliable delivery of their attack. Interestingly, this phish was sent just a day after Bill Gates’ Twitter account was hacked and used to tweet a message nearly identical to this email.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->

	<p>Area 1 uses multiple analysis techniques that leverage insight gained from proactive web crawling and early identification of attacker campaign infrastructure, to detect and stop email from spoofed domains and accounts. Using preemptive threat hunting and a broad set of proprietary analysis techniques, Area 1 identifies phishing campaigns, including malicious newly registered domains, that other defenses miss.</p>
