At the time of writing, we are seeing a very small amount of traffic from Rogers, but we are only seeing residual traffic, and nothing close to a full recovery to normal traffic levels.</p><p>Based on what we’re seeing and similar incidents in the past, we believe this is likely to be an internal error, not a cyber attack.</p><p><a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/ca\">Cloudflare Radar</a> shows a near complete loss of traffic from Rogers <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\">ASN</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/812?date_filter=last_24_hours\">AS812</a>, that started around 08:45 UTC (all times in this blog are UTC).</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/tZHDhahk4nR00oDfI8szG/69206b447a14414679c882f894bbaba0/Rogers1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>What happened?</h3><p>Cloudflare <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/812?date_filter=last_24_hours\">data</a> shows that there was a clear spike in <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\">BGP</a> (Border Gateway Protocol) updates after 08:15, reaching its peak at 08:45.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/15UuM3cVejUo6RdHzU7SBq/d1504fe15950343230d8a5cfadfc3e89/Rogers2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>BGP is a mechanism to exchange routing information between networks on the Internet. The big routers that make the Internet work have huge, constantly updated lists of the possible routes that can be used to deliver each network packet to its final destination. Without BGP, the Internet routers wouldn&#39;t know what to do, and the Internet wouldn&#39;t exist.</p><p>The Internet is literally a network of networks, or for the maths fans, a graph, with each individual network a node in it, and the edges representing the interconnections. All of this is bound together by BGP. BGP allows one network (say Rogers) to advertise its presence to other networks that form the Internet. Rogers is not advertising its presence, so other networks can’t find Rogers network and so it is unavailable.</p><p>A BGP update message informs a router of changes made to a prefix (a group of IP addresses) advertisement or entirely withdraws the prefix. In this next chart, we can see that at 08:45 there was a withdrawal of prefixes from Rogers ASN.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6tJghQaY9RR5dE3iLz5E14/61ad8bd9c01ecf35e1a2901c1d4d29b0/Rogers3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1600\" height=\"188\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Since then, at 14:30, attempts seem to be made to advertise their prefixes again.
