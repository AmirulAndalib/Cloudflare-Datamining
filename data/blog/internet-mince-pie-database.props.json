After some confusion relating to our 2017 edition of the IMDB we should clearly state: modern mince pies do not contain meat. A Mince Pie is “a sweet pie of British origin, filled with a mixture of dried fruits and spices called mincemeat, that is traditionally served during the Christmas season in the English world.” - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mince_pie\">Wikipedia for Mince Pie</a></p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/9l4k8S5cx7UqPVdw7p25L/5e2631cb378a33b8e980a8e2cf8bcb9f/mincepie-Sketch--Today-at-14.07.04.png\" alt=\"A cross-section drawing of a classic mince pie\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1848\" height=\"932\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h2>Our methodology</h2><p>We reviewed the mince pies in terms of its characteristics as well as overall. Each mince pie was given a score of 1 to 10 for each of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Innovation</p></li><li><p>Booziness</p></li><li><p>Pastry to Filling Ratio</p></li><li><p>Pastry</p></li><li><p>Mince</p></li><li><p>Overall rating</p></li></ul><p>The top 3 categories there are somewhat objective measurements compared to the more subjective ones below. During analysis, this created some exciting opportunities.</p><h2>Analysis</h2><p>With this combination of 3 subjective &amp; 3 objective metrics and a total of 214 submitted reviews by our team, we had a lot of data. To break this data down Nela quickly settled on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).</p><h3>The Pearson Correlation Coefficient</h3><p><a href=\"https://wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a> describes the PCC as follows:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1iok4F6Gh9I3kqz4e16YyF/7ac7d8de6c38493b7b3f90bbb5533ceb/f76ccfa7c2ed7f5b085115086107bbe25d329cec.1.0.0_\" alt=\"formula for the population Pearson Correlation Coefficient\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"148\" height=\"48\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><blockquote><p>The correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to 1. A value of 1 implies that a linear equation describes the relationship between X and Y perfectly, with all data points lying on a line for which Y increases as X increases. A value of −1 implies that all data points lie on a line for which Y decreases as X increases. A value of 0 implies that there is no linear correlation between the variables.</p></blockquote><p>By setting our X Value as the Overall Rating, we were able to plug in each of the other metrics from our reviews as the Y value, to understand how important each of these characteristics are in producing a high quality result.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/As76BfBuh2Rcz9zZVHq5c/7a1684a65febb11412b6519bed0914bc/2018_mince_pie_correlation_coefficient-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"656\" height=\"813\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>2018 Internet Mince pie Database evaluation criteria coefficient. <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/nela7296#!/vizhome/2018MincePieRatingCriteria/RatingCriteriaCoefficient\">Explore the full dataset</a></p><p>From this data we can conclude that satisfaction with a pie’s mince filling is the most likely criteria for overall pie satisfaction with <code>r=.841</code>, while innovation creates a negative correlation implying that traditional mince pies are favoured, and straying from this will only lead to dissatisfaction. Alcohol content had a minor positive correlation while pastry, pastry to filling ratio, and aesthetic had an average positive correlation.</p><h3>Word Association</h3><p>Along with scores, our reviewers also left tasting notes which gave an insight into how they arrived at their scores. Taking the reviews which scored a mince pie from 1-5 we’re able to see the terms most associated with poorer performing pies:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6GPC7lCIeM7O27KtOOS5Gm/bacbf59cd926cc392ab3c3d85fbc973e/bad_mince_pie_review_word_cloud.png\" alt=\"Bad mince pie review word cloud\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Pies scoring between 6 and 10 points had the following terms used the most in tasting notes:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5pDTjVBjvHukQAzb3klSqn/94f1550ed08028d36cf2bdeb04fcd5ec/good_mince_pie_review_word_cloud.png\" alt=\"Good mince pie review word cloud\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h2>Also-rans and notable mentions</h2><p>Before we get to the final overall rankings, there’s a few categories we wanted to mention.</p><h3>The Most Expensive Pies</h3><p>Unsurprisingly, some of the most expensive mince pies come from London’s fanciest Restaurants &amp; Bakeries. The 3 most expensive mince pies did not rank highly enough to feature elsewhere - which goes to show you that money doesn’t necessarily buy you the best mince pie.</p><h4><a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/\">Ottolenghi</a> Mince Pie</h4><p>Overall</p><p>Price</p><p>Booziness</p><p>Aesthetic</p><p>Pastry-to-Filling Ratio</p><p>Innovation</p><p>Pastry</p><p>Filling</p><p>6.647</p><p>£10 for 4 (250ppp)</p><p>8.176</p><p>8.471</p><p>7.647</p><p>4.000</p><p>6.588</p><p>6.059</p><blockquote><p>A Dickensian-styled thing of beauty, I expected a pie-seller to appear muttering &quot;gawd blimey guv&#39;nor thems good pies&quot;.
