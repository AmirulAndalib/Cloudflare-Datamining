Team members diligently went out and purchased mince pies from all over the South East of England for everyone to taste.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/mince_pie_collecting_collage.png\" alt=\"Mince pie collecting collage\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>On Monday the team assembled for a “Mince Pie Jam”, where we would taste &amp; consistently review each pie:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/2018_mince_pie_jam_kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"The 2018 Cloudflare Mince Pie Jam\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"aquickrefresherwhatisamincepie\">A quick refresher - what is a mince pie?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/internet_search_mince_pies.png\" alt=\"Internet search for Mince Pies\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>As we can see from even the most cursory Internet search, there’s a lot of questions surrounding mince pies. After some confusion relating to our 2017 edition of the IMDB we should clearly state: modern mince pies do not contain meat. A Mince Pie is “a sweet pie of British origin, filled with a mixture of dried fruits and spices called mincemeat, that is traditionally served during the Christmas season in the English world.” - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mince_pie\">Wikipedia for Mince Pie</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2017/12/mincepie-Sketch--Today-at-14.07.04.png\" alt=\"A cross-section drawing of a classic mince pie\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"ourmethodology\">Our methodology</h2>\n<p>We reviewed the mince pies in terms of its characteristics as well as overall. Each mince pie was given a score of 1 to 10 for each of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Innovation</li>\n<li>Booziness</li>\n<li>Pastry to Filling Ratio</li>\n<li>Pastry</li>\n<li>Mince</li>\n<li>Overall rating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The top 3 categories there are somewhat objective measurements compared to the more subjective ones below. During analysis, this created some exciting opportunities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"analysis\">Analysis</h2>\n<p>With this combination of 3 subjective &amp; 3 objective metrics and a total of 214 submitted reviews by our team, we had a lot of data. To break this data down Nela quickly settled on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).</p>\n<h3 id=\"thepearsoncorrelationcoefficient\">The Pearson Correlation Coefficient</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a> describes the PCC as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f76ccfa7c2ed7f5b085115086107bbe25d329cec\" alt=\"formula for the population Pearson Correlation Coefficient\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to 1. A value of 1 implies that a linear equation describes the relationship between X and Y perfectly, with all data points lying on a line for which Y increases as X increases. A value of −1 implies that all data points lie on a line for which Y decreases as X increases. A value of 0 implies that there is no linear correlation between the variables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By setting our X Value as the Overall Rating, we were able to plug in each of the other metrics from our reviews as the Y value, to understand how important each of these characteristics are in producing a high quality result.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/2018_mince_pie_correlation_coefficient-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>2018 Internet Mince pie Database evaluation criteria coefficient. <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/nela7296#!/vizhome/2018MincePieRatingCriteria/RatingCriteriaCoefficient\">Explore the full dataset</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>From this data we can conclude that satisfaction with a pie’s mince filling is the most likely criteria for overall pie satisfaction with <code>r=.841</code>, while innovation creates a negative correlation implying that traditional mince pies are favoured, and straying from this will only lead to dissatisfaction. Alcohol content had a minor positive correlation while pastry, pastry to filling ratio, and aesthetic had an average positive correlation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wordassociation\">Word Association</h3>\n<p>Along with scores, our reviewers also left tasting notes which gave an insight into how they arrived at their scores. Taking the reviews which scored a mince pie from 1-5 we’re able to see the terms most associated with poorer performing pies:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/bad_mince_pie_review_word_cloud.png\" alt=\"Bad mince pie review word cloud\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Pies scoring between 6 and 10 points had the following terms used the most in tasting notes:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/12/good_mince_pie_review_word_cloud.png\" alt=\"Good mince pie review word cloud\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"alsoransandnotablementions\">Also-rans and notable mentions</h2>\n<p>Before we get to the final overall rankings, there’s a few categories we wanted to mention.</p>\n<h3 id=\"themostexpensivepies\">The Most Expensive Pies</h3>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, some of the most expensive mince pies come from London’s fanciest Restaurants &amp; Bakeries.
