	<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/dallas">Dallas</a> started <a href="http://dreamhost.com">DreamHost</a> back in college with a few other people. They were inspired by all the possibilities of the web and wanted to bring that to as many people as possible. He's also a musician and all-around fun guy.</p>
	<p>The fun guy has definitely transcended into the DreamHost culture. One of the largest hosting providers in the world, DreamHost is known for its fun atmosphere and laid-back employees.</p>
	<p>"I think it's good to expose a little bit of your culture back out [to the public]. I don't think it hurts your product," said Dallas.</p>
	<p>DreamHost, who issues a hilariously popular newsletter and doesn't shy away from the creative, shows a lot of personality in most of their work. They consider their customers "fans" and even hosted a "reach out and touch you" tour earlier this year.</p>
	<p>"Having personality helps build the brand and have a differential," said Dallas.</p>
	<p>It's not all fun and games for DreamHost though. As one of the most popular hosting providers out there, they are focusing on building a better product and expanding their network.</p>
	<p>In the fall, DreamHost will be bringing on a new, east coast data center in Virginia to grow their network and better serve their customers. They are also developing a cloud computing service that is currently in alpha and scheduled to hit beta later this year.</p>
