	<p>Beneath the veneer of glass and concrete, this is a city of surprises and many faces. On 3rd October 2019, we brought together a group of leaders from across a number of industries to connect in Central Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
	<p>The habit of sharing stories at the lunch table, exchanging ideas, and listening to ideas from the different viewpoints of people from all tiers, paying first-hand attention to all input from customers, and listening to the dreams of some of life’s warriors may sound simple but it is a source of inspiration and encouragement in helping the cyberspace community in this region.</p>
	<p>And our new data center in Jakarta extends our Asia Pacific network to 64 cities, and our global network to 194 cities.</p>
	<h2>Selamat Pagi</h2>
	<p>Right on time, Kate Fleming extended a warm welcome to our all our Indonesia guests. "We were especially appreciative of the investment of your time that you made coming to join us."</p>
	<p>Kate, is the Head of Customer Success for APAC. Australian-born, Kate spent the past 5 years living in Malaysia and Singapore. She leads a team of Customer Success Managers in Singapore. The Customer Success team is dispersed across multiple offices and time zones. We are the advocates for Cloudflare Enterprise customers. We help with your on-boarding journey and various post sales activities from project and resource management planning to training, configuration recommendations, sharing best practices, point of escalation and more.</p>
	<p>"Today, the Indonesian Cloudflare team would like to share with you some insights and best practices around how Cloudflare is not only a critical part of any organization’s cyber security planning, but is working towards building a better internet in the process.” - Kate</p>
