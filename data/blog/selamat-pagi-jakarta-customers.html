	<p>Beneath the veneer of glass and concrete, this is a city of surprises and many faces. On 3rd October 2019, we brought together a group of leaders from across a number of industries to connect in Central Jakarta, Indonesia. <br><br>The habit of sharing stories at the lunch table, exchanging ideas, and listening to ideas from the different viewpoints of people from all tiers, paying first-hand attention to all input from customers, and listening to the dreams of some of life’s warriors may sound simple but it is a source of inspiration and encouragement in helping the cyberspace community in this region.<br><br>And our new data center in Jakarta extends our Asia Pacific network to 64 cities, and our global network to 194 cities.</p>
