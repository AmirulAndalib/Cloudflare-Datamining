	<p>CloudFlare and <a href="http://www.gandi.net/" target="_blank">Gandi</a> have been hosting a speaker series on DNS, previously bringing in the founder of DNS <a href="http://internethalloffame.org/inductees/paul-mockapetris" target="_blank">Paul Mockapetris</a> and <a href="https://dankaminsky.com/bio/" target="_blank">Dan Kaminsky</a>, who uncovered one of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/07/details-of-dns/" target="_blank">most critical vulnerabilities in DNS</a>.</p>
	<p>Our third and final talk is coming up on June 21st at 6PM PST at the Gandi office in San Francisco (live stream link will be posted on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Root-Zone/events/231047866/" target="_blank">the Meetup page</a>) and you won’t want to miss it, because our speaker is none other than <a href="http://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/paul-vixie" target="_blank">Paul Vixie</a>.</p>
	<p>Paul wrote most of <a href="https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/" target="_blank">BIND Version 8</a> and hired the team who wrote BIND Version 9, the most widely used DNS software on the Internet. He founded <a href="https://www.isc.org/" target="_blank">ISC</a>, home of BIND and <a href="https://www.isc.org/f-root/" target="_blank">F-root</a> and later operated <a href="http://c.root-servers.org/" target="_blank">C-root</a>.</p>
	<p>We'll talk about <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/20160330_let_me_make_yeti_dns_perfectly_clear/" target="_blank">alternative DNS root servers</a>, email security and spam (Paul founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_Abuse_Prevention_System" target="_blank">first ever anti-spam company</a>), and what needs to be done about DNS and security (Paul added most of BIND’s current security systems).</p>
	<p>So come grab a beer and let's geek out about DNS one more time.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Root-Zone/events/231047866/" target="_blank">RSVP here</a>.</p>
