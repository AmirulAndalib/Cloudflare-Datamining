	<p>The Cloudflare Workers team is excited to announce the opening of our Discord channel! You can join right away by going <a href="https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Through our Discord channel, you can now connect with the team to ask questions, show off what youâ€™re building, and discuss the platform with other developers.</p>
	<p>Sometimes you just need to talk to another human being. Our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers">developer docs</a> will always be the source of truth on the mechanics of Workers, but we want to provide quicker help if you need it.</p>
	<h3 id="growing-the-workers-community">Growing The Workers Community</h3>
	<p>Over the past three years, Cloudflare Workers evolved from an initial sandbox for enterprise customers writing edge code to a developer platform for creating new applications and systems.</p>
	<p>â€œWe bet our whole business on Workers and it paid off big time,â€ said Hamlet Batista, CEO of RankSense, a SEO automation platform. â€œWe've been saving a lot of money on infrastructure costs and DevOps resources we no longer need.â€</p>
	<p>Our team is constantly surprised by the palette of use cases from those developing on Workers. For example, a developer in Belgium <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/built-with/projects/make-facemasks">created</a> a static Workers site that teaches an online tutorial in three different languages on how to make your own face mask, which earned the approval of the Belgian government.</p>
	<h3 id="why-discord">Why Discord?</h3>
	<p>Discord provides a medium that allows users to openly share their thoughts while maintaining anonymity. Itâ€™s also really fast â€” partially due to Discordâ€™s use of Workers and Cloudflareâ€™s network.</p>
	<p>â€œWorkers are in the path of virtually all Discord requests,â€ said Mark Smith, Director of Infrastructure at Discord. â€œWe are longtime users of Workers and big fans of the power and flexibility they give us to continue building great things for our users.â€</p>
	<p>As we continue to build the ecosystem of developer tools, weâ€™d love to hear what youâ€™re building, whether itâ€™s a personal site of your pet or an API gateway. Come <a href="https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev">say hi</a> today.</p>
