Rather than having one large conference annually, we have multiple Innovation Weeks throughout the year to highlight new product announcements, beta products opening up to general availability, and share how our customers are using Cloudflare to help build a better Internet.</p><p>Internally, these weeks generate a lot of energy and excitement as well, as they provide an opportunity for teams from across Cloudflare to work together on product delivery and celebrate company-wide successes. In 2021, we had seven Cloudflare Innovation Weeks. As we start planning our 2022 Innovation Weeks, we are reflecting back on the highlights from each of these weeks.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image2-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"security-week-march-21-26-2021\"><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/security-week/\">Security Week</a> March 21-26, 2021</h3><p><strong>Patrick Donahue</strong></p><p>Security Week kicked off Cloudflare’s 2021 Innovation Weeks with a series of foundational security announcements. The Internet wasn’t built with security in mind, but the products and partnerships announced this week continued Cloudflare’s core mission of helping build a better Internet—one that companies of all sizes can plug into and be protected by default from the types of attacks that have historically resulted in loss of data, computing resources, and customer confidence.</p><p>At the start of the week, we took on the task of replacing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mpls/\">MPLS</a>, the core network technology that many organizations use to connect their offices and data centers, with a <a href=\"https://t.co/Bn2aMflr3P\">more secure and cost-effective alternative</a>. Next, we tackled the biggest risk to everyday users of the web by <a href=\"https://t.co/v6ZYtjJOhJ\">opening our remote browser isolation technology to teams of all sizes</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-page-shield/\">protecting against malicious code injection</a>. Following those announcements, we inverted the slow, network chokepoint model of data loss prevention <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/data-loss-prevention/\">by building zero trust controls over data directly into every aspect of the Cloudflare One suite</a>. And to round out the week, we <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/super-bot-fight-mode/\">democratized access to bot-fighting technology previously only available to the largest enterprises</a> while also  <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/api-abuse-detection/\">deepening our solutions for novel threats facing APIs</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security-week/\">View all Security Week 2021 Blog Posts</a><br><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/search/security%20week\">View all Security Week 2021 Cloudflare TV Series</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image3-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"developer-week-april-11-17-2021\"><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-week/\">Developer Week</a> April 11-17, 2021</h3><p><strong>Alyson Cabral</strong></p><p>With Developer Week, we had one focus – to make developers’ lives easier. Our announcements included<a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-ga/\"> Cloudflare Pages being made generally available</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-websockets-in-workers/\">Introducing Web Socket Support in Workers</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-unbound-ga/\">Workers Unbound</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tunnel-for-everyone/\"> Free Tunnels</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/\">Partnering with Nvidia to bring AI to the Edge</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/developer-week/\">many more announcements throughout the week.</a> In addition to the announcements, we also launched our first ever <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/developer-week-challenges/\">Developer Challenge</a> series. Each day, a new challenge was announced to encourage developers from across the globe to level up their skills by trying new features and approaches. Solutions were revealed the following day, with the <a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/event/TUlc16pW13ou8en25LKE2\">bonus round solution</a> wrapping up the week.

Impact Week highlighted some of the things we are doing as a company around environmental, social and governance initiatives. We launched <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/pangea/\">Project Pangea</a>, a free program to provide secure, reliable access to the Internet for community networks that support under-served communities. We also shared how we are <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/helping-build-a-green-internet/\">committed to helping build a green Internet</a> through efficiency, renewable energy, and providing developers a choice to run their workloads in the most energy efficient data centers. In addition, we published our <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-human-rights-commitments/\">first human rights policy</a> in order to better serve our mission and core values.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/impact-week/\">View all Impact Week 2021 Blog Posts</a><br><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/impact-week\">View all Impact Week 2021 Cloudflare TV Series</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image8-11.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"speed-week-sept-12-17-2021\"><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/speed-week/\">Speed Week</a> Sept 12-17, 2021</h3><p><strong>Marc Lamik</strong></p><p>Helping make the Internet faster is one of Cloudflare’s core priorities.

We launched the company 11 years ago: September 27, 2010. It has been our tradition, since our first birthday, to use this week to launch innovative products that we think of as our gift back to the Internet. In 2021, we announced <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/\">Cloudflare R2</a>, our object-based storage with no egress fees, tackled solutions to <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tackling-email-spoofing/\">Email Spoofing and Phishing</a>, shared how we are <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-offices/\">expanding our network into office buildings</a> as well as many more product announcements and Cloudflare TV executive fireside chats and product discussions.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/birthday-week/\">View all Birthday Week Blog Posts</a><br><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/search/birthday%20week\">View all Birthday Week Cloudflare TV Series</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image5-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"full-stack-week-nov-14-19-2021\"><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/full-stack-week/\">Full Stack Week</a> Nov 14-19, 2021</h3><p><strong>Rita Kozlov</strong></p><p>During <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/full-stack-week-2021/\">Full Stack Week</a>, we brought the vision of the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-network-is-the-computer/\">Network is the Computer</a> to life — allowing developers to build their entire application on our network, soup to nuts. Over the course of the week, we made a series of announcements, each providing another critical piece of the puzzle, necessary to build a full stack application.</p><p>We started with the foundation — data, announcing the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/durable-objects-ga/\">general availability of Durable Objects</a>, and ability to <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/relational-database-connectors/\">connect to databases</a>, alongside <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-adds-support-for-two-modern-data-platforms-mongodb-atlas-and-prisma/\">partnerships with MongoDB and Prisma</a>. <a href=\"https://pages.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Pages</a>, our Jamstack platform also took a step deeper down the stack by introducing support for seamless <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-goes-full-stack/\">deployment of functions</a>. We want development on our platform to be an enjoyable experience, so we announced the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/wrangler-v2-beta/\">new version of wrangler</a>, our CLI, and <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-worker-services/\">Services</a>, a better way for teams to build applications. And while we want developers to have fun, we also want them to be able to monetize their efforts, which they now can do using the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-stripe-support-in-workers/\">Stripe SDK</a> on Workers.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/full-stack-week/\">View all Full Stack Week 2021 Blog Posts</a><br><a href=\"https://cloudflare.tv/full-stack-week\">View all Full Stack Week Cloudflare TV Series</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image7-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"cio-week-dec-5-10-2021\"><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/cio-week/\">CIO Week</a> Dec 5-10, 2021</h3><p><strong>Annika Garbers</strong></p><p>To wrap up the year, we <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/interactive-demo/\">demonstrated</a> how Cloudflare One, our Zero Trust <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/network-as-a-service-naas/\">Network-as-a-Service</a>, is helping Chief Information Officers transform their corporate networks.
