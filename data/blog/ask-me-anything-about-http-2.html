	<p>We're big fans of HTTP/2 at Cloudflare. Our customers make up <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-impact-on-the-http-2-universe">the majority of HTTP/2 enabled domains</a> <a href="http://isthewebhttp2yet.com/measurements/adoption.html#organization">today</a>. HTTP/2 is a key part of the modern web, and its growth and adoption is changing how websites and applications are built.</p>
	<p>On Thursday April 28, 2016, our friends at CatchPoint are hosting a live AMA (Ask Me Anything) with experts from CloudFlare, Akamai, and Google answering questions in real time about the protocol's features, adoption, and future.</p>
	<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday April 28, 2016 from 2pm-3pm Eastern Time (1600-1700 UTC)</p>
	<p><strong>How:</strong> Ask questions <a href="http://pages.catchpoint.com/HTTP2-AMA-Registration.html?LSD=REF-CloudFlare">ahead of time</a> (and vote on questions). Join in <a href="http://pages.catchpoint.com/HTTP2-AMA-Registration.html?LSD=REF-CloudFlare">real-time</a> on Thursday.</p>
	<p><strong>Who:</strong> Cloudflare's own <a href="https://twitter.com/SuzanneAldrich">Suzanne Aldrich</a> will join Ilya Grigorik from Google, Tim Kadlec from Akamai, and Andrew Smirnov from Catchpoint.</p>
