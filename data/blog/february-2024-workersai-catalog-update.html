	<p>Over the last few months, the Workers AI team has been hard at work making improvements to our AI platform. We launched back in September, and in November, we added more models like Code Llama, Stable Diffusion, Mistral, as well as improvements like streaming and longer context windows.</p>
	<p>Today, we’re excited to announce the release of eight new models.</p>
	<p>The new models are highlighted below, but check out our full model catalog with over 20 models <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai">in our developer docs.</a></p>

	<p>Our mission is to support a wide array of open source models and tasks. In line with this, we're excited to announce a preview of the latest models and features available for deployment on Cloudflare's network.</p>
	<p>One of the standout models is <code>deep-seek-coder-6.7b</code>, which notably scores <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder">approximately 15% higher</a> on popular benchmarks against comparable Code Llama models. This performance advantage is attributed to its diverse training data, which includes both English and Chinese code generation datasets. In addition, the <code>openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b</code> model showcases how high quality fine-tuning datasets can improve the accuracy of base models. This Mistral 7b fine-tune outperforms the base model by <a href="https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B#benchmark-results">approximately 10% on many LLM benchmarks</a>.</p>
	<p>We're also introducing innovative models that incorporate Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), such as the <code>llama-2-13b-awq</code>. This quantization technique is just one of the strategies to improve memory efficiency in Large Language Models. While <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-quantization">quantization</a> generally boosts inference efficiency in AI models, it often does so at the expense of precision. AWQ strikes a balance to mitigate this tradeoff.</p>
	<p>The pace of progress in AI can be overwhelming, but Cloudflare's Workers AI simplifies getting started with the latest models. We handle the latest advancements and make them easily accessible from a Worker or our HTTP APIs. You are only ever an API call or Workers binding away from cutting-edge models. Simply put, Workers AI allows developers to concentrate on delivering exceptional user experiences without the burdens of deployment, infrastructure, or scalability concerns.</p>

	<p>A newer use case we support with this model catalog update is the ability to classify and check prompts and responses with <code>llamaguard-7b-awq</code>. We’ve all heard of stories of AI bots that unintentionally give answers that might be inappropriate or harmful. This <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations">new LlamaGuard mode</a>l allows developers to detect and categorize when a prompt or a response is potentially unsafe, allowing them to control the inputs and outputs of their applications with developer-defined categories.</p>
	<p>Here’s an example of an application that takes a user input and compares that to an example set of defined unsafe categories to determine if the input is safe or not. You can customize the content categories depending on your use case. <i>The below example categories are provided for informational purposes only, and Cloudflare does not make any guarantees regarding the performance of Llama Guard or any outcomes or results.</i></p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">import { Ai } from '@cloudflare/ai';
