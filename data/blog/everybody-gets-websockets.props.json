A WebSocket connection is bidirectional: the server can send data to the browser without the browser having to explicitly ask for it. This makes things like multiplayer games, chat, and other services that require real-time exchange of information possible over a standard web protocol</em></p>\n<p>There's a lot more technical history in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-now-supports-websockets/\">that post</a> covering how we modified NGINX to support a huge number of connections through port reuse. But the bottom line is that WebSockets are a vital technology for web sites that need to get real-time updates for features like social feeds, multimedia chat, collaborative editing, multi-player gaming, stock updates, and more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performancelatency\">Performance &amp; Latency</h3>\n<p>Because the WebSocket protocol creates a single connection and doesn’t require HTTP requests, WebSockets can provide anywhere from 500:1 to a 1000:1 reduction in unnecessary HTTP header traffic, compared to HTTP polling solutions.</p>\n<p>The server no longer needs to wait for a request to come back before it sends new data; it can simply push the data to the client the moment it has new information. Tests have shown a 3:1 reduction in latency compared to other polling solutions.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/164628453?color=ff9933&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\"  frameborder=\"0\"  width=\"650\" height=\"407\"  webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n<h3 id=\"moderninternetformorepeople\">Modern Internet, for More People</h3>\n<p>Last week, we expanded our deep support for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/http2\">HTTP/2</a> to include <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-support-for-http-2-server-push-2/\">Server Push</a>. HTTP/2 was finalized as a spec in 2015, so almost a newborn child as technologies go. (We're excited to help HTTP/2 grow up fast.)</p>\n<p>By comparison, WebSockets is already a toddler, as RFC 6455 was finalized in 2011.</p>\n<p>But, perhaps because of complexity or expense, WebSockets hasn't seen as wide adoption as we'd expect. CloudFlare is removing those obstacles, and frankly we're curious to see what happens.</p>\n<p>We are building a better Internet, and while that may sound like a platitude... making modern tech easy to use matters. We're eager to see what our customers do to play, grow, and thrive with another tool available.</p>\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/websockets/\">WebSockets</a> generally, or review details in our <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169466-Can-I-use-CloudFlare-with-WebSockets-\">support article</a>.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
