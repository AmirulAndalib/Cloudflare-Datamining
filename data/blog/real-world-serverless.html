	<p>I work in Developer Relations at Cloudflare and I'm fortunate to have top-notch developers around me who are willing to share their knowledge with the greater developer community. I produced a series of events this autumn called Real World Serverless at multiple locations around the world and I want to share the recorded videos from these events.</p>
	<p>Our Austin Real World Serverless event (in partnership with the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ATX-Serverless">ATX Serverless User Group Meetup</a>) included two talks about Serverless technology featuring <a href="https://twitter.com/Miss_Vee22">Victoria Bernard</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/preston-pham-92715938">Preston Pham</a> from Cloudflare. They spoke about working out backend knots with <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers">Workers</a> and building a router for the great good.</p>
	<h3>About the talks</h3>
	<p><b>Working out Backend Knots with Workers - Victoria Bernard (0:00-15:19)</b></p>
	<p>Cloudflare Workers is a platform the makes serverless development and deployment easier than ever. A worker is a script running between your clients' browsers and your site's origin that can intercept requests. Victoria went over some popular use cases of how proxy workers can dramatically improve a site's performance and add functionality that would normally require toying with complicated back-end services.</p>
	<p><b>Build a Router for Great Good </b><b><b>- Preston Pham (15:20-33:53)</b></b></p>
	<p>Serverless computing is great, but requires routing or some kind of API gateway. Preston built a simple JavaScript routing library for serverless Worker scripts and explained how you can do this too. He built a router from the ground up, similar to other web application frameworks like flask or express.js.</p>
