	<p>We’re at the cPanel Conference in Denver this week, so feel free to drop by our booth and say hello. It’s a great opportunity to connect with our partners and better understand their needs. We’re always trying to streamline our partners’ user experience, and we thought it would be a fitting time to walk through our recently updated WHMCS integration.</p>
	<p>CloudFlare’s WHMCS 6.0 plugin lets hosting providers and registrars extend all the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/overview" target="_blank">benefits</a> of CloudFlare directly to their customers. You can offer your entire user base a global CDN with 62 points of presence, automatic <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/features-optimizer" target="_blank">web content optimization</a>, basic DDoS protection, reputation-based threat protection, and much more with virtually no extra work.</p>
	<p>These benefits are seamlessly integrated into your WHMCS client. All your customers need to do is click a button, and a new CloudFlare account will be configured for them.</p>

	<p>While <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/a/sign-up" target="_blank">signing up</a> for an account on www.cloudflare.com only takes a few minutes, users do need to point the relevant DNS records to CloudFlare’s nameservers. Offerring a one-click solution via our WHMCS integration is a great opportunity for hosting providers and registrars to streamline the process for their customers.</p>
	<h3 id="universalsslwithwhmcs">Universal SSL with WHMCS</h3>
	<p>CloudFlare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl" target="_blank">Universal SSL</a> offering provides free SSL encryption to all customers on its network. However, as a partner, Universal SSL is only available with <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203685674-Full-setup-versus-Partial-CNAME-setup" target="_blank">full DNS integration</a> (opposed to CNAME integration). Our WHMCS module comes with full DNS integration built-in, making it the fastest way to get up and running with Universal SSL.</p>
	<p>So, in addition to the performance and basic security benefits of CloudFlare, you can also offer free SSL encryption to all of your customers.</p>
	<h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h3>
	<p>Becoming a partner means you can offer your customers faster and more secure websites than providers that don’t have a CloudFlare integration.</p>
	<p>To integrate CloudFlare into your WHMCS solution, start by visiting our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/certified-partners" target="_blank">partners page</a> and telling us a little bit about your company. We’ll provide an API key that you can use to install our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/static/misc/cloudflare_whmcs-latest.zip" target="_blank">WHMCS module</a>.
