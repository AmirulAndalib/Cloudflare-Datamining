Thousands of CloudFlare customers installed the app.</p><p>In November, we heard that Apture was shutting down their service, as part of their acquisition by Google. Good for them, but we thought immediately &quot;What can we do for CloudFlare site owners?&quot;</p><p>Our first instinct was to look around for a replacement service, or more than one, but no obvious alternative emerged. And Apture&#39;s deadline for turning the service off was set to Tuesday, December 20.</p><p>What to do?</p><h3>The Response: One-Day Hackathon</h3><p>Three folks on the CloudFlare team -- Ram, Chris, and Kevin -- decided they could make something similar and useful, given a little bit of time. Offered a single day, as a mini-hackathon, the enthusiastic trio agreed. Our positive experience with <a href=\"/favris-is-cloudflare-winner-at-techcrunch-dis\">larger hackathons</a> helped set the model and expectations.</p><p>On December 7, Ram, Chris and Kevin closed the door of a conference room and ignored the rest of the team. They started with pastries and coffee. A clean whiteboard was quickly filled.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6czXGXMoFjfIXrnDNuJX8c/b89dd46511f66a73a1001e1d10526d6b/whiteboard-and-pastries.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Later in the day, brief interruptions were tolerated for delivery of burritos and Red Bull.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/uDEAvD8JUVMmWwVt9SPXj/36e7be1b9df8615bf26f940f596a1752/burritos.jpg.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The team combined several technologies, internal and external, to deliver a simple, polished experience. Free APIs from Bing and DuckDuckGo were explored and put to use. <a href=\"http://js.cloudflare.com/\">CloudFlareJS</a> as a JavaScript loader made performance straightforward.</p><p>Many additional ideas were discussed, but 12 hours isn&#39;t much time. The team decided on delivering the core functions of web search, definitions, and (a nice touch) incorporating the &quot;read aloud&quot; benefits of Pronounce, an existing CloudFlare app.</p><p>It was a long day, but ultimately successful for Ram, Chris, and Kevin. And for CloudFlare customers.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1fMtWwKAI290dtPNAlFBne/f8cff5aa5f9c1a0f217e4311778c3325/Ram_Chris_Kevin_Finished_Work.JPG.scaled500.jpg\" alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>The Result: Highlight</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/highlight\">Highlight</a> is a one-click install on your CloudFlare-powered site. Highlight gives your site visitors contextual web search and definitions -- and no one needs to leave your site.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3FLPNcUeHcMfksfi2GSDZQ/8ae026f280e5eee64dbbc8dda31bb588/highlight-detail.png.scaled500.png\" alt=\"App: Goodbye Apture, Hello Highlight\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"465\" height=\"220\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Visitors select a word or phrase, and a quiet tooltip appears, inviting them to seek more info or simply listen to the word or phrase read out loud.</p><h3>Invitation to Apture Customers</h3><p>CloudFlare customers looking to replace Apture simply need to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/highlight\">turn on Highlight</a>.</p><p>Not yet a CloudFlare customer? Take five minutes and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/sign-up\">sign up for CloudFlare</a>. And then use CloudFlare Apps to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/highlight\">install Highlight</a> as a worthy replacement to Apture.</p>",
