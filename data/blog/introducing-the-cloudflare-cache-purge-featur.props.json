Cloudflare is smart about only\ncaching static objects so you can run a dynamic, database-driven site\nand it will behave as you expect. However, sometimes you want to edit\nstatic files like CSS, Javascript, or existing images and it can be\nfrustrating to wait a few hours for the Cloudflare cache to expire.\nThere are two ways to deal with this problem:</p>\n<p><strong>Go to Development Mode</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22280726-What-does-CloudFlare-Development-mode-mean-\">Development Mode</a>\nbypasses Cloudflare&apos;s accelerated cache and slows down your site, but is\nuseful if you are making changes to cacheable content (like images, css,\nor JavaScript) and would like to see those changes right away. You can\nget to Development Mode by going to:<br>\nSettings-&gt;Cloudflare Settings-&gt;Development Mode-&gt;Toggle On.</p>\n<p><strong>Purge Cache</strong><br>\nWe read every email and tweet that we get. Often users write in with\nfeature requests and we aim to build the most common ones quickly. This\nweek, we released a new Cloudflare feature based on user feedback called\nthe &quot;Cache Purge&quot;. Some frequently asked questions about the &quot;Cache\nPurge&quot; can be found below:</p>\n<p><strong>Where can I find the purge cache option?</strong><br>\nThe cache purge option is found by going to Settings-&gt;Cloudflare\nsettings.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the cache purge option do?</strong><br>\nCache purge will Immediately purge all cached resources for your\nwebsite. This will force Cloudflare to expire all static resources\ncached prior to the button click and fetch a new version.<br>\n<p><strong>I have more than one domain. Do I have to purge the cache for each<br>\nsite?</strong><br>\nThe cache purge is done at the domain level (purging will refresh the<br>\ncache for all your websites that share a domain).</p></p>\n<p><strong>Can I only purge certain file extensions?</strong><br>\nNo, not at this time. Please <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/contact.html\">contact\nus</a> if you would like to see us\ndevelop additional caching features.</p>\n<p><strong>How often should I purge my cache?</strong><br>\nYou should purge your cache if there is a cached resource that you want\nto immediately stop serving. If you are doing development and making\nconstant changes, use Development Mode instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep in mind...</strong><br>\nYou will end up slowing down your site if you&apos;re constantly purging\nresources from your site. When you purge the cache, that means we have\nto fetch all requested resources from your server. It will take up to 3\ndays to rebuild the cache to an optimal level depending on the traffic\nto your site. What this really means is that your site will not be at\noptimal performance until the cache rebuilds.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
