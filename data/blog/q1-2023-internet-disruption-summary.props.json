In the fourth quarter of 2022, a number of disruptions were related to attacks on electrical infrastructure, and this pattern continued into the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>One such disruption occurred in Odessa on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1618602213965692930\">January 27</a>, amid <a href=\"https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/russian-missile-attack-in-ukraine-hits-kyiv-and-energy-plants-near-odessa\">news</a> of Russian airstrikes on local energy infrastructure.

This is especially true of government-directed shutdowns, which occurred fairly regularly through 2022. To that end, civil society organization <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/\">Access Now</a> recently published their <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-2022/\"><em>Internet shutdowns in 2022</em></a> report, finding that In 2022, governments and other actors disrupted the internet at least 187 times across 35 countries. Cloudflare Radar is proud to support Access Now’s <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/keepiton/\">#KeepItOn</a> initiative, using our data to help illustrate the impact of Internet shutdowns and other disruptions.</p><p>To follow Internet disruptions as they occur, check the <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center\">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center (CROC)</a> or the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar_get_AnnotationsOutages\">Radar API</a>.
