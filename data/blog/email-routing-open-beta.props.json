It means that there’s no waitlist anymore; every zone* in every Cloudflare account has Email Routing available to them.</p><p>To get started just open one of the zones in your <a href=\"https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/email/overview\">Cloudflare Dashboard</a> and click on <i>Email</i> in the navigation pane.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2H4sSM4n0aBeDZ08i7MQng/60e937413697e00c56de9d8a335e8015/image1-2-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1254\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>Our journey so far</h3><p>Back in September 2021, during Cloudflare’s Birthday Week, we <a href=\"/introducing-email-routing/\">introduced</a> Email Routing as the simplest solution for creating <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email-routing/\">custom email addresses</a> for your domains without the hassle of managing multiple mailboxes.</p><p>Many of us at Cloudflare saw a need for this type of product, and we’ve been using it since before it had a UI. After Birthday Week, we started gradually opening it to Cloudflare customers that requested access through the wait list; starting with just a few users per week and gradually ramping up access as we found and fixed edge cases.</p><p>Most recently, with users wanting to set up Email Routing for more of their domains and with some of <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/2855120\">G Suite legacy</a> users looking for an alternative to starting a subscription, we have been onboarding tens of thousands of new zones <i>every day</i> into the closed beta. We’re loving the adoption and the feedback!</p><p>Needless to say that with hundreds of thousands of zones from around the world in the Email Routing beta we uncovered many new use cases and a few limitations, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/known-limitations\">a couple of which</a> still exist. But these few months of closed beta gave us the confidence to move to the next stage - open beta - which now makes <b>Cloudflare Email Routing available to everyone, including free zones</b>.</p><p>Thank you to all of you that were part of the closed beta and provided feedback. We couldn’t be more excited to welcome everyone else!</p><p>Check out this blog post for more details on <a href=\"/migrating-to-cloudflare-email-routing/\">how to migrate to Cloudflare Email Routing</a>. And if you have any questions or feedback about this product, please come see us in the <a href=\"https://community.cloudflare.com/new-topic?category=Feedback/Previews%20%26%20Betas&tags=email\">Cloudflare Community</a> and the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/cloudflaredev\">Cloudflare Discord</a>.</p><p>___</p><p><sup>*</sup>we do have a few limitations, such as not currently supporting Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) and subdomains. Known limitations are listed in the documentation.</p>",
