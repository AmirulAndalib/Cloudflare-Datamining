Page Not Found errors (also known as 404s) are a common occurrence on the web where content is constantly created and discarded. However, few things increase a site&#39;s bounce rate faster. Even cutesy errors — which may garner a frustrated smile—don&#39;t actually help a visitor find what they&#39;re looking for.</p><p>Imagine our horror to discover that over 1% of all page views that pass through CloudFlare&#39;s global network lead to a 404 error! <i>We knew that something had to be done.</i></p><h3>Your Enemy: the 404 Error</h3><p>A web site&#39;s server will typically generate a &quot;404 - Not Found&quot; page when a visitor to a site tries to access a page that doesn&#39;t exist for one reason or another. These errors typically occur when someone mistypes a URL on your site, when there&#39;s a broken link from another page or site, when a page that previously existed is moved or removed, or if there is an error when a search engine indexes your site. What&#39;s worse is that they can be impossible to control, as many old links come from external sites.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4d3jeaHAF8El7i8LxE3axs/6b762c6bdc77e9a4f98ae1ab2e7cadf1/apache_404_default.gif.scaled500.gif\" alt=\"SmartErrors: Decrease Your Site's Bounce Rate\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"400\" height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>_The 404 error: not a pretty enemy_404s can be problematic for site owners as they:</p><ul><li><p>Are a lost opportunity to engage with a visitor</p></li><li><p>Increase bounce rates (when users click back and navigates away)</p></li><li><p>May lead to SEO (search engine optimization) penalization</p></li></ul><h3>Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It</h3><p>Introducing SmartErrors: a beta feature that can be enabled with a single click, and that dynamically transforms dead-end error pages into an intelligent site search. SmartErrors uses keywords from the referring link that produced the 404 to find relevant content and discourage your site&#39;s visitors from using the back button and leaving your site to lookelsewhere.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4C4WUV8GUoHE5RYCWRe8UB/1096617430fb10d5e059eeb121288d0a/smarterrors-example.png.scaled500.png\" alt=\"SmartErrors: Decrease Your Site's Bounce Rate\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h4>SmartError&#39;s Substantially Increases Visitor Engagement</h4><p>In our testing across hundreds of CloudFlare sites we&#39;ve measured average visitor engagement rates of over 12%, with some sites as high as 75-80%. What this means is that, on average, 12% of SmartErrors resulted in deeper engagement with a site. It really does make a difference!</p><p>SmartErrors can also help your site&#39;s SEO (search engine optimization). Dead-end pages can rob your site of so called &quot;link juice.&quot; We&#39;ve marked all links that point off your site as rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; and designed the page so that both search crawlers and actual visitors stay on your site.</p><h3>Who Gets SmartErrors?</h3><p>SmartErrors can be enabled for any active CloudFlare site from the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps?app=smarterrors\">app store</a>. To learn more about how SmartErrors works, check out the detailed app description <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps?app=smarterrors\">here</a>.</p><p>With SmartErrors we&#39;re excited to tackle one of the web&#39;s most frequently seen errors as we continue our mission of building a faster, safer and smarter Internet.</p>",
