	<p>In February, CloudFlare packed up our first office in Palo Alto and headed up the 101 to San Francisco. Moving our headquarters to SF not only expanded our workspace, but also put us next to many thriving startups. The new office is located in the heart of San Francisco's SOMA district, complete with an one block walk to Caltrain, the Giants stadium and Blue Bottle Coffee at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Cento330">Cento</a> on Ritch Street.</p>
	<p>Some of our favorite things about our new office: our 7000 lbs freight elevator, <a href="http://1amsf.com/2011/02/11/outside-in-exhibition-artists-bringing-the-elephunk">Graffiti elephant</a> and the ping pong table. It is a weekly battle to name the CloudFlare ping pong champion.</p>
