Depending on the country, there are clear shifts and changing patterns in Internet use, particularly before dawn and after sunset.</p><p>This year, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan\">Ramadan</a> started on April 2, and it continued until May 1, 2022, (dates vary and are dependent on the appearance of the crescent moon). For Muslims, it is a period of introspection, communal prayer and also of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting_during_Ramadan\">fasting</a> every day from dawn to sunset. That means that people only eat at night (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iftar\"><i>Iftar</i></a> is the first meal after sunset that breaks the fast and often also a family or community event), and also before sunrise (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suhur\"><i>Suhur</i></a><i>)</i>.</p><p>In some countries, the impact is so big that we can see in our Internet traffic charts when the sun sets. Sunrise is more difficult to check in the charts, but in the countries more impacted, people wake up much earlier than usual and were using the Internet in the early morning because of that.</p><p>Cloudflare Radar data shows that Internet traffic was impacted in several countries by Ramadan, with a clear increase in traffic before sunrise, and a bigger than usual decrease after sunset. All times in this blog post are local. The data in the charts is bucketed into hours. So, for example, when we show an increase in traffic at 0400 we are showing that an increase occurred between 0400 and 0459 local time.</p><p><b>Indonesia</b> is a clear example of that, showing trends that continued until the end of Ramadan:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7AJpXrrgzsNoD0kzf086F1/71375d1a147806f570122ca5a92e193d/indonesia-4g.jpeg.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"2000\" height=\"953\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>In the next table, we show a country ranking by order of impact. Here, we include traffic changes before dawn and after sunset. In the last column, you can also see the change in traffic after Ramadan ended, right after sunset.
