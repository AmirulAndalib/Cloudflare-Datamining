	"description": "Earlier this week we announced how CloudFlare enabled OCSP stapling in order to improve our customers&#x27; SSL performance. OCSP stapling is awesome and improves SSL performance by as much as 30%. However, it is limited to browsers that support OCSP stapling and only benefits CloudFlare&#x27;s customers."
