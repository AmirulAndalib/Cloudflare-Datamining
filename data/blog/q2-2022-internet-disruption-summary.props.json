The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions. In many cases, these disruptions can be attributed to a physical event, while in other cases, they are due to an intentional government-directed shutdown. In this post, we review selected Internet disruptions observed by Cloudflare during the second quarter of 2022, supported by traffic graphs from <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> and other internal Cloudflare tools, and grouped by associated cause or common geography.</p><h2 id=\"optic-outages\">Optic outages</h2><p>This quarter, we saw the usual complement of damage to both terrestrial and submarine fiber-optic cables, including one that impacted multiple countries across thousands of miles, and another more localized outage that was due to an errant rodent.</p><h3 id=\"comcast\">Comcast</h3><p>On April 25, Comcast subscribers in nearly 20 southwestern Florida cities <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1518705241801338881\">experienced an outage</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220427120613/https://capecorallocalnews.com/2022/04/news/fiber-cut-causes-major-southwest-florida-xfinity-outage/\">reportedly</a> due to a fiber cut. The traffic impact of this cut is clearly visible in the graph below, with Cloudflare traffic for these cities dropping to zero between 1915–2050 UTC (1515–1850 local time).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image19.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Not only did the fiber cut force a significant number of Comcast subscribers offline, but it also impacted the types of traffic observed across Comcast as a whole.

The graphs below show the impact to Cloudflare traffic from the Telkom autonomous system in three South African provinces. The top graph shows the impact to traffic in Gauteng, while the lower graph shows the impact in Limpopo and North West. Across all three, traffic falls at 0600 UTC (0800 local time), recovering around 1300 UTC (1500 local time).

Although the fiber cut reportedly impacted subscribers in multiple states, the most significant impact was measured in Falcón, as shown in the graph below. In this state, traffic dropped precipitously at 1800 UTC (1400 local time), finally recovering approximately 24 hours later.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image20.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"aae-1-smw-5\">AAE-1 &amp; SMW-5</h3><p>Just after 1200 UTC on Tuesday, June 7, the <a href=\"https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/asia-africa-europe-1-aae-1\">Africa-Asia-Europe-1 (AAE-1)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/seamewe-5\">SEA-ME-WE-5 (SMW-5)</a> submarine cables suffered cable cuts, impacting Internet connectivity for millions of Internet users across multiple countries in the Middle East and Africa, as well as thousands of miles away in Asia. Although specific details are sparse, the cable damage reportedly occurred in Egypt – both of the impacted cables land in <a href=\"https://www.submarinecablemap.com/landing-point/abu-talat-egypt\">Abu Talat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.submarinecablemap.com/landing-point/zafarana-egypt\">Zafarana</a>, which also serve as landing points for a number of other submarine cables.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a> graphs below illustrate the impact of these cable cuts across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

According to a <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/british-columbia-internet-outage-caused-by-beaver/\">published report</a>, a beaver gnawed its way through a tree, causing it to fall on both power lines and a Telus fiber optic cable. The damage to the fiber optic cable affected connectivity customers in over a dozen communities across British Columbia, including those using <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/18988\">CityWest (AS18988)</a>, a utility company that uses the Telus cable. In the graph below, the impact of the damage to the fiber optic cable is clearly visible, with no traffic to Cloudflare from CityWest subscribers in British Columbia between 1800 UTC on June 7 until 0310 UTC on June 8 (1100–2010 local time).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image34.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"school-s-in-internet-s-out\">School’s in, Internet’s out</h2><p>Nationwide Internet shutdowns have, unfortunately, become a popular approach taken by authoritarian regimes over the past half dozen years to prevent cheating on secondary school exams. It is not clear that this heavy-handed tactic is actually effective in preventing cheating, but the <a href=\"https://smex.org/the-cost-of-internet-shutdowns/\">associated damage to the national economies</a> has been estimated to be in the tens to hundreds of millions of US dollars, depending on the duration and frequency of the shutdowns.</p><p>This year, governments in Sudan and Syria implemented a number of multi-hour shutdowns in late May into June, while Algeria’s government appears to have resorted to more targeted content blocking. Additional details on these Internet disruptions can be found in the recent <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/syria-sudan-algeria-exam-internet-shutdown/\"><em>“Exam time means Internet disruptions in Syria, Sudan and Algeria”</em> blog post</a>.</p><p>Starting on May 30, Syria implemented the first of four nationwide Internet shutdowns, the last of which occurred on June 12, as seen in the graph below. Interestingly, we have observed that these shutdowns tend to be “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1532349153090600961\">asymmetric</a>” in nature — that is, inbound traffic (into the country) is disabled, but egress traffic (from the country) remains. One effect of this is visible as spikes in the DNS graph below. During three of the four shutdowns, requests to Cloudflare’s <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/dns/\">1.1.1.1</a> resolver from clients in Syria increased because DNS queries were able to exit the country, but responses couldn’t return, leading to retry floods.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image33.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In Sudan, daily shutdowns were implemented 0530-0830 UTC (0730–1030 local time) between June 11 and June 22, except for June 17. (It isn’t clear why that date was skipped.) The graph below shows that these shutdowns were nationwide, but not complete, as traffic from the country did not drop to zero.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In Algeria, exams took place June 12 through June 16. In the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44557028\">past</a>, the country has implemented nationwide shutdowns, but after recognizing the <a href=\"https://dig.watch/updates/internet-restriction-during-exam-algeria-cost-nearly-us388-million\">enormous cost to the economy</a>, the government has apparently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAlgiersPost/status/1535917324485656576\">chosen an alternate tactic</a> this year. The graph below shows nominal drops in country-level traffic during the two times each day that the exams took place—0730–1000 UTC (0830–1100 am local time) and 1330–1600 UTC (1430–1700 local time). These drops in traffic are likely more indicative of a content-blocking approach, instead of a broad Internet shutdown.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image40.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>On June 27, the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq began to implement twice-weekly (Mondays and Thursday) multi-hour regional Internet shutdowns, expected to last for a four-week period. The shutdowns are intended to prevent cheating on high school final exams, according to a <a href=\"https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/28797-KRG-will-implement-short-internet-blackouts-to-prevent-exam-cheating%C2%A0\">published report</a>, and are scheduled for 0630–1030 am local time (0330–0730 UTC). The graph below shows the impact to traffic from three governorates in Kurdistan, with traffic dropping to near zero in all three areas during the duration of the shutdowns.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"government-guided\">Government-guided</h2><p>In addition to shutting down the Internet to prevent cheating on exams, governments have also been known to use shutdowns as a tool to limit or control communication around elections, rallies, protests, etc. During the second quarter, we observed several such shutdowns of note.</p><p>On April 10, following the blocking of social networks, VPN providers, and cloud platforms, the government of Turkmenistan implemented a<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1513510448762695687\"> near complete Internet shutdown</a>, starting at 1400 UTC. Apparently related to <a href=\"https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO2204/S00107/keepiton-turkmenistan-rips-a-page-from-the-authoritarian-playbook-digitally-disconnects-the-nation.htm\">criticism over the recent presidential election</a>, the disruption lasted nearly 40 hours, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1513907409579876360\">traffic started to return</a> around 0700 UTC on April 12.

The disruption lasted only two hours, and was limited in scope — it was not a nationwide shutdown. (Telecom providers <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/pakistan-disrupts-internet-amid-protests-over-prime-ministers-ousting/\">claimed</a> that it was due to problems with a web filtering system.) At a national level, the impact of the disruption is visible as a slight drop in traffic.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image2-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In the cities of Lahore and Karachi, the disruption is visible a little more clearly, as is the rapid recovery in traffic.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image24.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The impact of the disruption is most evident at a network level, as seen in the graphs below. <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/9541\">Cyber Internet Services (AS9541)</a> saw a modest drop in traffic, while <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/45669\">Mobilink (AS45669)</a> experienced a near complete outage.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image17.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image22.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Closing out the quarter, a communications blackout, including an Internet shutdown, was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/internet-cut-sudans-capital-ahead-pro-democracy-protests-2022-06-30/\">imposed in Sudan</a> on June 30 as protestors staged rallies against the country's military leadership.

This island-wide outage caused a significant interruption to Internet services, clearly visible in Cloudflare traffic data. The graph below shows that as the power failed, traffic from Puerto Rico immediately fell by more than half. The regular diurnal pattern remained in place, albeit at lower levels, over the next three days, with traffic returning to “normal levels” three days later. By April 10, Luma Energy reported that it had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1513318978717982730\">restored electrical power to 99.7% of its 1.5M customers</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image36.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The impact of the Internet service disruption is also fairly significant when viewed at a network level.

According to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mobinnet/status/1525744287446712320\">tweet</a> from Mobinnet, the disruption was due to a “widespread cyber attack of foreign origin”.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"ukraine\">Ukraine</h2><p>Now more than four months into the war in Ukraine, the Internet continues to be an active battlefield, with ongoing Internet outages in multiple cities and across multiple networks. However, we want to highlight here two similar events observed during the second quarter.</p><p>The Russian-occupied city of Kherson experienced a near-complete Internet outage between 1600 UTC (1900 local time) on April 30 and 0430 UTC (0730 local time) on May 4. According to social media posts from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1521798960003825664\">Ukraine’s vice Prime-Minister Mykhailo Fedorov</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dsszzi/posts/306820328295777\">State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection</a>, the outage was caused by “interruptions of fiber-optic trunk lines and disconnection from the power supply of equipment of operators in the region”. The graph below shows effectively no traffic for Kherson for approximately 24 hours after the disruption began, followed by a nominal amount of traffic for the next several days.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image41.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Around the time that the nominal amount of traffic returned, we also observed a shift in routing for an <a href=\"https://bgpview.io/prefix/91.206.110.0/23\">IPv4 prefix</a> announced by <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/47598\">AS47598</a> (Khersontelecom). As shown in the table below, prior to the outage, it reached the Internet through several other Ukrainian network providers, including <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/12883\">AS12883</a>, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/3326\">AS3326</a>, and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/35213\">AS35213</a>. However, as traffic returned, its routing path now showed a Russian network, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/201776\">AS201776</a> (Miranda) as the upstream provider. The path through Miranda also includes <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/asn/12389\">AS12389</a> (Rostelecom), which bills itself as “<a href=\"https://www.company.rt.ru/en/\">the largest digital services provider in Russia</a>”.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Peer AS</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Last Update</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">AS Path</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>AS1299 (TWELVE99 Arelion, fka Telia Carrier)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5/1/2022 16:02:26</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1299 12389 201776 47598</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AS6777 (AMS-IX-RS)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4/28/2022 11:23:33</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">12883 47598</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As the disruption ended on May 4, we observed updates to Khersontelecom’s routing path that enabled it to return to reaching the global Internet through non-Russian upstream providers.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Peer AS</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Last Update</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">AS Path</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>AS174 (COGENT-174)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5/4/2022 05:56:27</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">174 3326 3326 3326 47598</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AS1273 (CW Vodafone Group PLC)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5/4/2022 03:11:25</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1273 12389 201776 47598</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Additional details about this outage and re-routing event can be found in the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tracking-shifts-in-internet-connectivity-in-kherson-ukraine/\"><em>“Tracking shifts in Internet connectivity in Kherson, Ukraine”</em> blog post</a>.</p><p>A month later, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1531380535922200579\">May 30</a>, we again observed a significant Internet disruption in Kherson starting at 1435 UTC (1735 local time). And once again, we observed updated routing for Khersontelecom, as it shifted from Ukrainian upstream providers to Russian ones. As of the end of June, the Internet disruption in Kherson and the routing through Russian upstream providers both remain firmly in place, although the loss of traffic has not been nearly as significant as the April/May disruption.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/07/image14.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Peer AS</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Last Update</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">AS Path</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>AS4775 (Globe Telecoms)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5/30/2022 13:56:22</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">4775 1273 12389 201776 47598</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AS9002 (RETN-AS)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5/30/2022 09:58:16</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">9002 3326 47598</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>This post is by no means an exhaustive review of the Internet outages, shutdowns, and disruptions that have occurred throughout the second quarter. Some were extremely brief or limited in scope, while others were observed but had no known or publicly conjectured underlying cause. Having said that, it is important to bring increased visibility to these events so that the community can share information on what is happening, why it happened, and what the impact was — human, financial, or otherwise.</p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar\">@CloudflareRadar</a> on Twitter for updates on Internet disruptions as they occur, and find up-to-date information on Internet trends using <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare Radar</a>.</p><h3 id=\"watch-on-cloudflare-tv\">Watch on Cloudflare TV</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframe.videodelivery.net/b53925dccd2f091abded0974401c30f1?poster=https%3A%2F%2Fcloudflarestream.com%2Fb53925dccd2f091abded0974401c30f1%2Fthumbnails%2Fthumbnail.jpg%3Ftime%3D%26height%3D600\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div><!--kg-card-end: html-->",
