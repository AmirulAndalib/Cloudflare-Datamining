	<p>How great would it be to have a dashboard with a holistic view of threats, malicious server activity, vulnerabilities, sensitive data access levels and a daily scan of resources across all of your applications and services? Now you can.</p>
	<p>Cloudflare is thrilled to announce its integration with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center">Cloud Security Command Center</a> (Cloud SCC) for Google Cloud Platform: A security and data risk platform helping enterprises gather data, identify threats, and act on them before they result in business damage or loss.</p>
	<p>The advantage of the Cloud SCC solution is that it surfaces insights from both the Google Cloud Platform, as well as Cloudflareâ€™s edge, in a unified dashboard.</p>
	<h4 id="whatcloudflaredataisvisiblewithinthecloudsccdashboard">What Cloudflare data is visible within the Cloud SCC dashboard?</h4>
	<p>Through Cloudflareâ€™s API endpoints, data is pushed to Googleâ€™s Cloud SCC dashboard and domain name information mapped to the appropriate Google Cloud asset. Cloudflareâ€™s branded card in the Cloud SCC dashboard is automatically populated with a summary of top theat origins, top types of threats, and latest Web Application Firewall (WAF) events.</p>

	<p>To view a full list of Cloudflare events, click on the Cloudflare card in Cloud SCC and it will take you to a â€œCloudflare Findingsâ€ page. From there, you can select a time period of visible events. The â€œFindingsâ€ table shows what type of event, when it happened, and which asset (website, application, or API) was involved.</p>

	<p>Every Cloudflare finding offers detailed information, including: country source, IP source of original request, requested Hostname, requested URI, User Agent, protocol type, method (GET/POST), action taken, rule triggered, and more.</p>

	<p>Cloudflareâ€™s findings in the Cloud SCC dashboard highlight which requests were blocked or challenged, and why. To take action on this data, youâ€™ll need to login to your Cloudflare dashboard (link available directly from within Cloud SCC) or configure changes through the Cloudflare API.</p>

	<p>Cloud SCC is now running in alpha. If youâ€™d like to enable Cloud SCC and utilize it with Cloudflare, please submit your details <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/integrations/google-cloud">here</a> and weâ€™ll get back to you.</p>
