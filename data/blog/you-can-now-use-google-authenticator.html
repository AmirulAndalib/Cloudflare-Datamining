	<p>Since the very beginning, Cloudflare has offered <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/choosing-a-two-factor-authentication-system/">two-factor authentication with Authy</a>, and starting today we are expanding your options to keep your account safe with Google Authenticator and any Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) app of your choice.</p>
	<p>If you want to get started right away, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/a/account/my-account" target="_blank">visit your account settings</a>. Setting up Two-Factor with Google Authenticator or with any TOTP app is easy - just use the app to scan the barcode you see in the Cloudflare dashboard, enter the code the app returns, and you’re good to go.</p>

	<p>Often when you hear that an account was ‘hacked’, it really means that the password was stolen.</p>

	<p>Two-Factor authentication is sometimes thought of as something that should be used to protect <em>important</em> accounts, but the best practice is to always enable it when it is available. Without a second factor, any mishap involving your password can lead to a compromise. Journalist Mat Honan’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/" target="_blank">high profile compromise</a> in 2012 is a great example of the importance of two-factor authentication. When he later <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/" target="_blank">wrote about the incident</a> he said, "Had I used two-factor authentication for my Google account, it’s possible that none of this would have happened."</p>
	<h3 id="whatisatotpapp">What is a TOTP app?</h3>
	<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238" target="_blank">TOTP (Time-based One Time Password)</a> is the mechanism that Google Authenticator, Authy and other two-factor authentication apps use to generate short-lived authentication codes. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/choosing-a-two-factor-authentication-system">We’ve written previously on the blog</a> about how TOTP works.</p>
	<p>We didn’t want to limit you to only using two-factor providers that we'd built integrations with, so we built an open TOTP integration in the Cloudflare dashboard, allowing you to set up two-factor with any app that implements TOTP. That means you can choose from a wide array of apps for logging into Cloudflare securely with two-factor such as <a href="https://m.vip.symantec.com/home.v" target="_blank">Symantec</a>, <a href="https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile" target="_blank">Duo Mobile</a> and <a href="https://support.1password.com/guides/ios/?q=totp" target="_blank">1Password</a>.</p>
