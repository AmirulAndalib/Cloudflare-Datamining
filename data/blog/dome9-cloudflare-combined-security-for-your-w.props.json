It's a great complement to the web security that CloudFlare provides.</p>\n<p>Like CloudFlare, Dome9 is super simple. You simply <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/dome9\">create a free Dome9 account</a>and install a lightweight agent on your host machine. After that, Dome9 will secure your server's host firewall, or your EC2 security groups -- Dome9 can work agentless on EC2.</p>\n<p>The magic of Dome9 is its ability to lock down all your administrative services so hackers can't brute force attack (or exploit a vulnerability of) SSH, RDP, MySQL and whatever else you've got running. Dome9 can open those services on demand (with just the click of a button) only for a specific user, service, and time period.</p>\n<p>Here's an optimal server security policy you might set with Dome9:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Port 80 - Open *only* for CloudFlare&apos;s proxy servers</li>\n<li>Port 443 - Open *only* for CloudFlare&apos;s proxy servers</li>\n<li>Port 22 (SSH) - Closed, and opened only on demand</li>\n<li>Port 8080 (phpMyAdmin) - Closed, and opened only on demand</li>\n<li>All the rest - Closed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this, your web server only communicates with CloudFlare and whomever you authorize.</p>\n<p>How hard is it to set this up? It takes just a few minutes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Activate your Dome9 account [2 clicks thanks to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/dome9\">CloudFlare Apps</a>]</li>\n<li>Install the Dome9 Agent on your server (Linux and Windows are supported). [3 minutes]</li>\n<li>In Dome9 Central, create a &#x2018;Web Servers&apos; security group with the above policy. [2 minutes]</li>\n<li>Attach your server to the new security group. [2 clicks]</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Setting a service to ‘On-Demand' is as easy as clicking a button.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dome9magicipsallowtrafficonlythroughthecloudflarenetwork\">Dome9 Magic IPs allow traffic only through the CloudFlare network</h3>\n<p>You're probably wondering how to allow only <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/ips\">CloudFlare IPs</a>? That's where Dome9's Magic IPs come into play.</p>\n<p>Magic IPs are special IP address lists that Dome9 creates and maintains. We've created a special Magic IP for CloudFlare customers: {cloudflare}</p>\n<p>With the {cloudflare} Magic IP you never have to worry about changes to CloudFlare's proxy IP addresses – Dome9 maintains them automatically.</p>\n<p>Hence, your port 80 policy within Dome9 will look like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Dome9 + CloudFlare = Combined Security For Your Website and Web Server\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/image01.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"Dome9 + CloudFlare = Combined Security For Your Website and Web Server \"><noscript><img alt=\"Dome9 + CloudFlare = Combined Security For Your Website and Web\nServer\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/image01.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"Dome9 + CloudFlare = Combined Security For Your Website and Web Server \"></noscript></p>\n<p>With CloudFlare and Dome9 you can kick your cloud or hosted server's security up a notch with fun, easy to use, next generation security services.</p>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/dome9\">Dome9 App page</a> today to get started.</p></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
