My name is Steve Nims and I&apos;m a recent graduate of Rochester\nInstitute of Technology&apos;s <a href=\"http://saunders.rit.edu/\">E. Philip Saunders College of\nBusiness</a> located in Rochester, NY. While I\nreceived my B.S. from RIT in Accounting, I&apos;ve always had a passion for\ntechnology. So after graduating, when two of my fraternity brothers\nasked me if I wanted to help with their start-up that builds and hosts\nwebsites for small and medium sized businesses/NPOs, I jumped at the\nopportunity.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.stephenjnims.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif\" title=\"More...\"><noscript><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.stephenjnims.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif\" title=\"More...\"></noscript></p>\n<p>The best part of our service is we&apos;re helping our clients save money by\nusing free and open source solutions like\n<a href=\"http://www.joomla.org/\">Joomla!</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a>\nto run their websites. We also cut costs by outsourcing design work to\npre-made templating firms like <a href=\"http://yootheme.com/\">YOOtheme</a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.rockettheme.com/\">RocketTheme</a> when we&apos;re not creating our\nown designs using <a href=\"http://www.artisteer.com/\">Artisteer</a>...none of us\nare graphic designers by any stretch of imagination!</p>\n<p>As the resident techie with our start-up, I&apos;m responsible for everything\nto do with our server including all-things security and performance\nrelated. Before CloudFlare, this required me to be constantly monitoring\nserver logs, adding suspected bad IP addresses to our firewall, and\ntuning the PHP bytecode cacher xcache on a constant basis, taking my\nattention away from delivering a truly unique customer experience to our\nclients.</p>\n<p>I was invited to use <a href=\"http://cloudflare.com\">CloudFlare</a> earlier this\nyear as a beta tester for my donating a MX entry to <a href=\"http://projecthoneypot.org/\">Project Honey\nPot</a> and installing a honey pot of my own\nto help collect bad IP addresses. I&apos;m kind of embarrassed to say, but I\nwas using Project Honey Pot to find the suspected bad IP addresses I was\nadding to our server&apos;s firewall, searching on one IP address at a time\nfrom our server&apos;s logs..not exactly the most efficient! That&apos;s why when\nI received the invite to CloudFlare and read what features the service\nprovided, especially in my case the blocking of bad internet traffic, I\nwas very excited!</p>\n<p>Since adding all of our websites to CloudFlare back in August, close to\n9,000 bad requests have been blocked from over 1600 unique threats. In\naddition, CloudFlare has accelerated our client&apos;s websites considerably:\n<strong><em>10.3DAYS</em></strong> of visitor&apos;s browsing time has been <strong><em>SAVED</em></strong>, <strong><em>29.9\nGB</em></strong> worth of bandwidth was <strong><em>NOT USED</em></strong> because of CloudFlare, and\nthe average page load time has <strong>DROPPED</strong> from <strong><em>2.03</em></strong> seconds to\n<strong><em>1.2</em></strong> seconds, meaning our websites load about <strong><em>40% FASTER</em></strong> with\nCloudFlare! Did I mention we get all of this using CloudFlare&apos;s\n<strong><em>FREE</em></strong> service?!?!</p>\n<p>That said, to help protect our clients from unwelcome visitors, <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22050782-Will-CloudFlare-hurt-my-SEO-\">speed\nup their\nwebsites</a>,\nand allow us to focus more on the service we provide to them, we now\nenable CloudFlare for <strong><em>ALL</em></strong> of our sites that we host - by my count,\nthat&apos;s <strong><em>22 websites!</em></strong> It was really easy to get our client&apos;s\nwebsites running through CloudFlare. There isn&apos;t any software to\ninstall, no messy configuration files to play with - no fuss! All I had\nto do was change the DNS entries for our client&apos;s domain names so they\npointed to CloudFlare&apos;s DNS servers and wait for the changes to\npropagate throughout the web. The only hard work was compiling the\nApache server module\n<a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/forums/21318827-How-do-I-restore-original-visitor-IP-to-my-server-logs-\">mod_cloudflare</a> so our\nserver&apos;s logs report the correct IP address of visiting users instead of\nCloudFlare&apos;s proxy IP. However, I&apos;ve done the hard work for you...read\nthe 5 easy steps I&apos;ve posted to my blog\n<a href=\"http://www.stephenjnims.com/2010/10/27/use-mod_cloudflare-on-your-ubuntu-10-04-lts-lamp-server/?utm_source=cloudflare_blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_content=mod_cloudflare_post&amp;utm_campaign=guest_blog\">here</a>\nfor a walk-through on how to download, compile and enable the module on\nyour own server. Using mod_cloudflare isn&apos;t required, but any systems\nadmin worth their weight will want to enable it.</p>\n<p>Beyond making the part of my job where I&apos;m managing the security and\noptimization of our server super easy, my favorite feature of CloudFlare\nis the development mode. I&apos;m known to tinker with a new CMS package that\nI&apos;ve read about on the web, or play around with variations on our\ncurrent websites&apos; designs for the fun of it, or sometimes load a demo\njust to see if a particular new idea works for a client. So I want to be\nable to see any updates or work I&apos;ve done immediately! The development\nmode temporarily disables CloudFlare&apos;s accelerated cache for 3 hours,\nallowing you to see changes in cachable content like CSS, JavaScript or\nimages as you change them. I don&apos;t have to tinker with page headers to\ntell CloudFlare not to cache certain content or set it&apos;s expiration time\neither. Also, without any intervention on my part, after the 3 hours are\nup, CloudFlare automatically reverts back to caching static content.</p>\n<p>If you&apos;re new to CloudFlare, I hope you enjoy the service as much as I\nhave! If you plan on running any sort of e-commerce website, or need an\nextra layer of security for your own purposes, check out the\n<a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/plans.html\">Pro</a> service plan (only\n$20/month for your first website, $5/month thereafter) which enables\nyou to easily add\n<a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22077247-How-do-I-add-SSL-to-my-site-\">SSL</a>\nsecurity to your website for only $1/month per site. With the Pro plan\nyou also get advanced security protection, even <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22263581-What-does-the-Website-Preloader-do-\">faster page\nloads</a>, and virtually real\ntime statistics!</p>\n<p>To see the portfolio of websites we&apos;ve worked on, check out\n<a href=\"http://streamlineyourself.com/?utm_source=cloudflare_blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=guest_blog\">http://streamlineyourself.com</a>.\nAlso, read up on some super nerdy stuff at my blog,\n<a href=\"http://www.stephenjnims.com/?utm_source=cloudflare_blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_content=frontpage&amp;utm_campaign=guest_blog\">http://www.stephenjnims.com</a>\nor find me on Twitter, username:\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/sjnims\">sjnims</a></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
