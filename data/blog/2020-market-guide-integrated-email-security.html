	<p><small><em>This blog originally appeared in November 2020 on the Area 1 Security website, and was issued in advance of Cloudflare's acquisition of Area 1 Security on April 1, 2022. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-are-acquiring-area-1">Learn more</a>.</em></small></p>

	<p>On Sept. 8, Gartner published its latest Market Guide for Email Security (Gartner Doc ID: G00722358). Given the continued increase of phishing and advanced attacks, ongoing enterprise migration to cloud email providers and the recent transition to remote work for many organizations, we at Area 1 Security believe this is an aptly-timed update.</p>
	<p>One new item of particular note in the report is Gartner’s new category of Integrated Email Security Solutions (IESS). While Area 1 Security was also recognized as a Representative Vendor in the Gartner 2019 Market Guide for Email Security, Gartner has now named Area 1 Security as a Representative Vendor for IESS. According to Gartner: “They [IESSs] often include other capabilities such as machine-learning-based detection trained on existing emails, image analysis, account takeover detection and image recognition of URLs to identify phishing attacks as well providing protection for internal emails and M-SOAR functionality.”</p>
	<p>We believe, Area 1 Security, as an IESS, provides the core functionalities of a SEG, but has the advantage of being very quick and easy to deploy, without requiring changes to the email flow at the gateway through <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-security/deployment">direct integrations</a> with Office 365 and Google G Suite.</p>

	<p>As an increasing number of threats bypass legacy Secure Email Gateways (SEGs), Area 1 Security’s customers and prospects have increasingly expressed that traditional SEGs don’t adequately address their security needs. In fact, we are often brought in to either replace or supplement SEGs such as those from Proofpoint, Agari and Mimecast.</p>
	<p>With SEGs missing over 30 percent of phishing campaigns, IESS solutions like Area 1 Security offer an attractive <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/replace-your-email-gateway-with-area-1">SEG replacement</a>.</p>

	<h3 id="additional-highlights-from-the-market-guide-for-email-security">Additional Highlights from the Market Guide for Email Security</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Per our understanding, Gartner advises security and risk management leaders responsible for email security to “Address gaps in the advanced threat defense capabilities of an incumbent secure email gateway (SEG) by either replacing them or supplementing them with complementary capabilities via API integration.” Some customers may decide to address these gaps by replacing an incumbent SEG with an IESS.</li>
		<li>Also, as noted in the report, “Integrated protection, because it has historical data on communication patterns, can use its social graph to flag anomalous messages as suspicious” and integrated solutions also “increasingly using natural language processing and understanding to identify account takeover attacks.”</li>
		<li>The Market Guide highlights differentiating capabilities for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/email-security-services">next-generation email security products</a>:</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Network Sandbox</strong><br><strong>Content Disarm and Reconstruction</strong><br><strong>URL Rewriting and Time-of-Click Analysis</strong><br><strong>Remote Browser Isolation</strong><br><strong>Display Name Spoof Detection</strong><br><strong>Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance on Inbound Email</strong><br><strong>Lookalike Domain Detection</strong><br><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Per our understanding, Gartner also lists additional differentiating email security capabilities such as graymail handling, data protection, and post-delivery protection and M-SOAR.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Area 1 Security believes it provides coverage across all the above differentiating capabilities (seven fully, and one in prototype / planned phase as of this quarter). The table below is a quick analysis of the key capabilities outlined within the 2020 Email Security Market Guide and how our technology fulfills each criteria. Where relevant, the matrix highlights capabilities that we believe are unique to our Area 1 Horizon™ &nbsp;service.<br></p>

	<p><em>*Bolded capabilities are part of Gartner’s key selection criteria for next-generation email security</em></p>
	<p>According to Gartner, “As organizations migrate to cloud email, the need to reevaluate email security is even greater.” The rise of malware, Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks and other sophisticated email threats also means organizations should revisit their email security architecture.</p>
