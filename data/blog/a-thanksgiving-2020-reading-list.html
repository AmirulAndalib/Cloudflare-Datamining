	<p>While our colleagues in the US are celebrating Thanksgiving this week and taking a long weekend off, there is a lot going on at Cloudflare. The EMEA team is having a full day on CloudflareTV with a series of live shows celebrating <a href="https://cfl.re/3nT7HHE">#CloudflareCareersDay</a>.</p>
	<p>So if you want to relax in an active and learning way this weekend, here are some of the topics we’ve covered on the Cloudflare blog this past week that you may find interesting.</p>

	<p>Making things fast is one of the things we do at Cloudflare. More responsive websites, apps, APIs, and networks directly translate into improved conversion and user experience. On November 10, Google announced that Google Search will directly take web performance and page experience data into account when ranking results on their search engine results pages (SERPs), beginning in May 2021.</p>
	<p>Rustam Lalkaka and Rita Kozlov explain in this blog post how Google Search will prioritize results based on how pages score on Core Web Vitals, a measurement methodology Cloudflare has worked closely with Google to establish, and we have implemented support for in our analytics tools. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/improving-performance-and-search-rankings-with-cloudflare-for-fun-and-profit">Read the full blog post</a>.</p>
	<p>Getting to the Core: Benchmarking Cloudflare’s Latest Server Hardware</p>
	<hr>
	<p>At the Cloudflare Core, we process logs to analyze attacks and compute analytics. In 2020, our Core servers were in need of a refresh, so we decided to redesign the hardware to be more in line with our Gen X edge servers. We designed two major server variants for the core. The first is Core Compute 2020, an AMD-based server for analytics and general-purpose compute paired with solid-state storage drives. The second is Core Storage 2020, an Intel-based server with twelve spinning disks to run database workloads. This is a refresh of the hardware that Cloudflare uses to run analytics provided big efficiency improvements.</p>

	<p>We <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-quicksilver-configuration-distribution-at-internet-scale">previously</a> explained how and why we built Quicksilver. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-quicksilver-into-production">Quicksilver</a> is the data store responsible for storing and distributing the billions of KV pairs used to configure the millions of sites and Internet services which use Cloudflare. This second blog post is about the long journey to production which culminates with Kyoto Tycoon removal from Cloudflare infrastructure and points to the first signs of obsolescence.</p>
	<p>Geoffrey Plouviez takes you through the entire story of real-world engineering challenges and what it’s like to replace one of Cloudflare’s oldest critical components.</p>

	<p>When we review design documents at Cloudflare, we are always on the lookout for Single Points of Failure (SPOFs). In this post, we present a timeline of a real-world incident, and how an interesting failure mode known as a Byzantine fault played a role in a cascading series of events.</p>
	<p>Tom Lianza and Chris Snook’s &nbsp;full blog post on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-byzantine-failure-in-the-real-world">Byzantine faults</a> describes the consequences of a malfunctioning switch on a system built for reliability.</p>
