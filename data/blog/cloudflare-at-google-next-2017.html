	<p>The Cloudflare team is headed to <a href="https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Google NEXT 2017</a> from March 8th - 10th at Moscone Center in San Francisco, CA. We’re excited to meet with customers, partners, and new friends.</p>
	<p>Come learn about Cloudflare’s recent partnership with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) through their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/interconnect/cdn-interconnect" target="_blank">CDN Interconnect Program</a>. Cloudflare offers performance and security to <strong>over 25,000 Google Cloud Platform customers</strong>. The CDN Interconnect program allows Cloudflare’s servers to establish high-speed interconnections with Google Cloud Platform at various locations around the world, accelerating dynamic content while reducing bandwidth and egress billing costs.</p>
	<p>We’ll be at booth C7 discussing the benefits of Cloudflare, our partnership with Google Cloud Platform, and handing out Cloudflare SWAG. In addition, our Co-Founder, Michelle Zatlyn, will be presenting “<a href="https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=a-cloud-networking-blueprint-for-securing-your-workloads-6c6de36a-59a5-4e6f-b434-f57653ffc997" target="_blank">A Cloud Networking Blueprint for Securing Your Workloads</a>” on Thursday, March 9th from 11:20 AM to 12:20 PM at Moscone West, Room 2005.</p>
	<h3 id="whatisgooglecloudplatformscdninterconnectprogram">What is Google Cloud Platform’s CDN Interconnect Program?</h3>
	<p>Google Cloud Platform’s CDN Interconnect program allows select CDN providers to establish direct interconnect links with Google’s edge network at various locations. Customers egressing network traffic from Google Cloud Platform through one of these links will benefit from the direct connectivity to the CDN providers and will be billed according to the lower Google Cloud Interconnect pricing.</p>

	<p>Joint customers of Cloudflare and Google Cloud Platform can <strong>expect bandwidth savings of up to 75% and receive <a href="https://cloud.google.com/interconnect/cdn-interconnect#pricing" target="_blank">discounted egress pricing</a></strong>. Egress traffic is traffic flowing from Google Cloud Platform servers to Cloudflare’s servers. The high-speed interconnections between GCP and Cloudflare speed up the delivery of dynamic content for visitors.</p>
	<h3 id="howdoesthecdninterconnectprogramwork">How does the CDN Interconnect program work?</h3>
	<p>As part of this program, 41 Cloudflare data centers are directly connected to Google Cloud Platform’s infrastructure. When one of these Cloudflare data centers requests content from a Google Cloud Platform origin, it’s routed through a high-performance interconnect instead of the public Internet. This dramatically reduces latency for origin requests, and it also enables discounted Google Cloud Platform egress pricing in the US, Europe and Asia regions.</p>

	<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
	<p>Securing your workloads in the cloud requires shifting away from the traditional “perimeter” security to a “pervasive, hierarchical, scalable” security model. In this session, we discuss cloud networking best practices for securing enterprise and cloud-native workloads on Google Cloud Platform. We describe a network security blueprint that covers securing your virtual networks (VPCs), DDoS protection, using third-party security appliances and services, and visibility and analytics for your deployments. We also highlight Google’s experiences in delivering its own services securely and future trends in cloud network security.</p>
