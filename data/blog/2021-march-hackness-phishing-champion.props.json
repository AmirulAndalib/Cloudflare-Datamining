WE HAVE A 2021 MARCH HACKNESS CHAMPION! (Granted, it’s a phishy title that no organization really wants to win).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/10/image2-2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>A Cinderella story. The underdog. The New Kid on the Block is … the <strong>World Health Organization</strong>!</p><p>Although the WHO won’t want you to get fooled (with phishing) again, they are the undisputed March Hackness Champion of 2021!</p><p>Truly, what a difference a year makes. The COVID-19 pandemic changed the world, including the world of Phishing and cyberattack lures. Our researchers identified <strong>over 2 million Phishing spoofs (out of more than 22 million) </strong>that specifically exploited the WHO brand between May 2020 to February 2021.</p><p>For example, in this phishing message from last year, the attacker lures victims by posing as the<strong> </strong>WHO, claiming to offer safety measures on how to stop the spread of the virus. We see Display Name Spoofing, where the <em>true</em> sender is actually this alansariornan[.]com domain.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/10/image1-30.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In an attempt to add legitimacy to the phishing example above:</p><ul><li>The attacker added the logo for the WHO in the body of their message. This is a common tactic, which Area 1 uses to help detect malicious messages (more specifically, our advanced computer vision algorithms and statistical models essentially train computers to interpret and understand digital images).</li><li>The attacker also used a fairly sophisticated technique to avoid detection by abusing the legitimate service, Appspot.com, to host their phishing site. Appspot is a cloud computing platform for developing and hosting web apps in Google-managed data centers, so naturally, those domains are commonly whitelisted — and the corresponding links are <em>not</em> typically evaluated.</li><li>Campaigns like this use well-designed login pages in an attempt to capture login credentials, which are then sent to a remote server controlled by the attacker.</li></ul><p>Attackers cleverly and maliciously pivoted to exploit other COVID-19 trends, such as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/business/coronavirus-emails.html\">businesses sending more sales emails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/15/coronavirus-pandemic-has-pushed-shoppers-to-e-commerce-sites.html\">consumers shopping online more</a>, <a href=\"https://magazine.realtor/news-and-commentary/feature/covid-19-s-impact-on-real-estate\">the real estate surge</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/covid-19-tracking-the-impact-on-media-consumption/\">growth of online news content consumption</a>.</p><p>Aside from the likes of the WHO (#1), Moderna (#25) and CDC (#48), these companies (whether they like it or not!) also made our annual phishing bracket for the first time this year:</p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>#7 — Marketo</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>#20 — Columbia Sportswear</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>#24 — UPS</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>#38 — CNN</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>#50 — Zoom</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>#51 — Adidas</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>#53 — Nike</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>#63 — Zillow</strong></strong></strong></li></ul><p>Much like in the real tournament, there were several upsets in the Phishing brackets as well. Former 2017 and 2019 March Hackness bracket champion, <strong>PayPal</strong>, didn’t even crack the Sweet 16 round this time.</p><p><strong>With the world on edge in 2020, hackers took every advantage they could to find a way into organizations. </strong>Their weapon of choice is trust. Who wouldn’t want information from the WHO about a virus that is affecting every aspect of their lives? Hackers know this, so they use it.</p><p>And as I shared in our prior Not-so-Sweet 16 post, email authentication and sender reputation standards (such as SPF, DKIM and DMARC) aren’t enough to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/how-to-prevent-phishing/\">prevent phishing attacks</a> from reaching inboxes.</p><p>Email authentication and sender reputation were designed to help brands deliver their email messages properly — not to help defend your organization from the most sophisticated phish.</p><p>In fact, our co-founder/CSO, Blake Darché, and our principal security researcher, Javier Castro, <a href=\"https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/2153307/lp/3955867/how-bad-actors-get-past-dmarc-in-60-minutes-or-less\">demonstrated</a> through the creation of a real-time, DMARC-passing attack, just how fast and easy it is for attackers to get phishing emails into your inbox.</p><p>Remember, even when you deploy DMARC for your domain:</p><ul><li>It’s easy it is to establish a new phishing domain that exploits trusted infrastructure</li><li>It’s fast to set up DMARC, SPF and DKIM policies for new phishing domains in order to reach inboxes</li><li>You need to detect phish beyond email authentication via comprehensive message analysis, computer vision, domain registration checks, and other techniques beyond email authentication.</li></ul><h3 id=\"takeaways-from-the-2021-march-hackness-tournament\">Takeaways from the 2021 March Hackness Tournament</h3><p>Here are some other key insights on the past year’s contenders:</p><ul><li>The Top 4 “seeds” were seen in over 6 million phishing attacks.</li><li>The Top 10 accounted for over 56% of ALL spoof- and impersonation-based phishing attacks.</li><li>Our 64-brand bracket included 15 different industries. The most well-represented were Technology and Financial Services/Banking.</li><li>Attackers will use what is in the headlines to make attacks land. COVID-19 and a Presidential Election heavily influenced the attack patterns of phishing attacks in the U.S. last year.</li></ul><p>Well America, I had a great time with you for the 2021 March Hackness tournament. Will our Cinderella return to the ball next year? You’ll have to join us again to find out!</p><p>Until next time…<em> (Dick Vitale one last time)</em></p><p><strong>GOODNIGHT BABY! WE’LL BE DANCING AGAIN NEXT YEAR!</strong></p>",
