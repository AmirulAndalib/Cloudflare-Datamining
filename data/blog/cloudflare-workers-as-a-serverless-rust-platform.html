	<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Rust Tooling for Workers has improved significantly since this post. Go <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-wrangler-cli">here</a> to check out Wrangler, our new Rust+Workers cli</em></p>
	<hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
	<p>The Workers team just <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/webassembly-on-cloudflare-workers">announced support</a> for WebAssembly (WASM) within Workers. If you saw my post on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-native-applications">Internet Native Apps</a>, you'll know that I believe WebAssembly will play a big part in the apps of the future.</p>
	<p>It's exciting times for Rust developers. Cloudflare's Serverless Platform, Cloudflare Workers, allows you to compile your code to WASM, upload to 150+ data centers and invoke those functions just as easily as if they were JavaScript functions. Today I'm going to convert my lipsum generator to use Rust and explore the developer experience (hint: it's already pretty nice).</p>
	<p>The Workers teams notes in the documentation:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>...WASM is not always the right tool for the job. For lightweight tasks like redirecting a request to a different URL or checking an authorization token, sticking to pure JavaScript is probably both faster and easier than WASM. WASM programs operate in their own separate memory space, which means that it's necessary to copy data in and out of that space in order to operate on it. Code that mostly interacts with external objects without doing any serious "number crunching" likely does not benefit from WASM.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>OK, I'm unlikely to gain significant performance improvements on this particular project, but it serves as a good opportunity illustrate the developer experience and tooling. ?</p>
	<h2 id="setuptheenvironmentwithwasmpack">Setup the environment with wasm-pack</h2>
	<p>Coding with WASM has been bleeding edge for a while, but Rust's tool for WASM development recently reached a fairly ergonomic state and even got a <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack">website</a>. Make sure you have the <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/prerequisites/index.html">prerequisites</a> installed and then follow the steps below to get started.</p>
	<p>wasm-pack allows you to compile Rust to WebAssembly, as well as generate bindings between JavaScript objects and Rust objects. We'll talk about why that's important later.</p>
	<pre><code># Install wasm-pack
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Cargo generate to build apps based on templates
cargo install cargo-generate

# And generate a HelloWorld wasm app, based on the wasm-pack template
cargo generate --git https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template

âœ¨   Done! New project created /Volumes/HD2/Code/cloudflare/bobross/bob-ross-lipsum-rust/api-rust/bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust
</code></pre>
	<p>The <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/tutorial/template-deep-dive/cargo-toml.html">WASM book</a> describes some of the glue in the Cargo.toml file, but the meat of the project is here:</p>
	<pre><code>...
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    fn alert(s: &amp;str);
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet() {
    alert("Hello, bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust!");
}
</code></pre>
	<p>This does two things</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Binds to the "external" function in our host environment where the WASM will run. If that's the browser, it will popup a window.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>It also defines a Rust function, greet() which will be made available as a function callable from the host environment, in our case JavaScript.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Build with <code>wasm-pack build</code></p>

</code></pre>
	<p>Subsequent builds will be faster. We eventually want to ship that .wasm file to a Worker, but I'd like to keep things local and test in a browser first.</p>
	<p>There's an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-wasm-app">npm</a> package that will create a templated webpack webapp, preconfigured to import WebAssembly node modules, which we'll use as a test harness.</p>
	<pre><code>$ npm init wasm-app www
npx: installed 1 in 2.533s
? Rust + ? Wasm = â¤
</code></pre>
	<p>Install the dependencies with <code>npm install</code> and then <code>npm start</code> to fire up the webpack bundled web server to serve your page</p>
	<pre><code>$ npm start

&gt; create-wasm-app@0.1.0 start /Volumes/HD2/Code/cloudflare/bobross/bob-ross-lipsum-rust/bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust/www
&gt; webpack-dev-server

â„¹ ï½¢wdsï½£: Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
</code></pre>
	<p>Open your web browser at <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> and you should see your first WASM generated content!</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/10/rust-wasm-hello-world.png" alt="Rust WASM Hello World" loading="lazy"></p>
	<p>OK, that's promising, but it's not actually our code. Our greet function returned <code>"Hello, bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust!"</code></p>
	<p>If we open up <code>www/index.js</code>, we can see this:</p>
	<pre><code>import * as wasm from "hello-wasm-pack";

wasm.greet();
</code></pre>
	<p>So it's importing a node module "hello-wasm-pack" which was part of the template. We want to import our <em>own</em> module we built with <code>cargo generate</code> earlier.</p>
	<p>First, expose our WASM package as a node module:</p>
	<pre><code># Create a global node_modules entry pointing to your local wasm pkg
$ cd pkg
$ npm link
...
/Users/steve/.nvm/versions/node/v8.11.3/lib/node_modules/bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust -&gt; /Volumes/HD2/Code/cloudflare/bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust/pkg
</code></pre>
	<p>Then make it available as a node_module in our test harness.</p>
	<pre><code>$ cd ../www
$ npm link bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust
/Volumes/HD2/Code/cloudflare/bobross/bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust/www/node_modules/bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust -&gt; /Users/steve/.nvm/versions/node/v8.11.3/lib/node_modules/bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust -&gt; /Volumes/HD2/Code/cloudflare/bobross/bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust/pkg
</code></pre>
	<p>Import it in the index.js file</p>
	<pre><code>//import * as wasm from "hello-wasm-pack";
import * as wasm from "bob-ross-lorem-ipsum-rust"
</code></pre>
	<p>and run!</p>
	<pre><code>npm run build
npm run start
</code></pre>
	<p>Better! That's our code.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/10/rust-wasm-hello-world2.png" alt="Rust WASM Hello World 2" loading="lazy"></p>
	<h3 id="quickrecap">Quick recap</h3>
	<p>We have:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A Hello, World WASM module</li>
		<li>Exposed as an npm module</li>
		<li>A webpack app which imports that module</li>
		<li>And invokes the greet() function</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We're now going to port our Bob Ross Lorem Ipsum generator to Rust, and try it out locally before uploading as a worker. Check it out on in the <a href="https://github.com/stevenpack/bob-ross-lipsum-rust">GitHub</a> repo, or follow along.</p>

</code></pre>
	<p>And I've exposed the method to WASM like this:</p>
	<pre><code>#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn get_phrase_text(phrase_cnt: usize, new_line: usize) -&gt; String {
    phrases::get_phrase_text(phrase_cnt, new_line)

</code></pre>
	<p>So, we should be good to call our WASM from the browser test harness. Let's modify <code>www/index.js</code> to invoke <code>get_phrase_text</code> and fire it up in the browser!</p>
	<pre><code class="language-javascript">//wasm.greet();
let phraseText = wasm.get_phrase_text(100, 10);
console.log(phraseText);
alert(phraseText);
</code></pre>
	<p>Fail.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/10/rust-wasm-fail-no-entropy.png" alt="Rust WASM Fail no entropy" loading="lazy"></p>
	<p>If you've played around with Rust, you'll know how jarring it can be to see your code compile and tests pass, only to have it blow up at runtime. The strictness of the language means your code behaves exactly as you expect more often than other languages, so this failure really threw me.</p>
	<p>Analysing the stack trace, we can see the failure starts at FromEntropy. My first instinct was that the WASM host didn't support providing entropy. I re-jigged the code to use a time-based seed instead and that failed too. The common theme seemed to be both entropy, and the current time, both make system calls.</p>
	<p>Reading through the relevant Github issues which discuss this <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/team/issues/16">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47102">here</a>, it looks like the design for how Rust generated WASM will handle system calls remains open. If the compiler isn't able to guarantee the system calls will be available, shouldn't the linker fail to compile? I think the answer lies in the <code>wasm-unknown-unknown</code> triplet that we compile to. There are no guarantees on what the target platform provides when you target unknown, so you're on your own.</p>
	<p>That said, we know that the v8 JavaScript engine will be our host in both the browser, and in Workers. There are libraries which allow us to make all Web APIs defined in the ECMAScript standard available to Rust, such as <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/js_sys/index.html">js-sys</a></p>
	<p>Using that, I can rewrite the failing <code>get_rng()</code> method to return a pseudo-random number generated seed with a time-based value using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">Date</a> object provided by the JavaScript host, rather than making a system call. Full code listing is on <a href="https://github.com/stevenpack/bob-ross-lipsum-rust">Github</a></p>
	<pre><code class="language-Rust">fn get_rng() -&gt; SmallRng {    
    use js_sys::Date;
    use rand::SeedableRng;

	//from Javascript	
    let ticks = Date::now(); 
    //convert the number to byte array to use as a seed
    let tick_bytes = transmute(ticks as u128); 
    SmallRng::from_seed(tick_bytes)
}
</code></pre>
	<p>After another <code>wasm-pack build</code> and reloading our test page...</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/10/rust-wasm-random-phrases.png" alt="Generating random phrases" loading="lazy"></p>
	<p>Huzzah! OK, if my WASM module returns the right output in Chrome, I'm feeling good about it working in Workers.</p>
	<h2 id="fromlocalbrowserharnesstoworkers">From local browser harness to Workers</h2>
	<p>You can use the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/api">API</a> or UI to upload. Below, I upload the .wasm file in my /pkg director and bind it to the global variable BOBROSS_WASM, where it will be available in my Worker.</p>
	<p><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/10/rust-wasm-upload.png" alt="Rust WASM upload" loading="lazy"></p>
	<p>If you're following and looked at the output of the <code>wasm-pack build</code> command, you might have noticed it produced a JavaScript glue file in the pkg folder, which is actually what the browser executed.</p>
	<p>It looks like this:</p>
	<pre><code>/* tslint:disable */

	<p>It takes care of the marshalling of strings from WASM into JavaScript and freeing the memory it uses. In an ideal world, we'd just include this in our Worker and be done. However, there a few differences between how Workers instantiates WebAssembly modules and the browser.</p>
	<p>You need to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Remove the import line</li>
		<li>Remove the export keywords</li>
		<li>Wrap all the functions in a module</li>
		<li>Create an importObject referencing the methods</li>
		<li>Pass that in when you create the WebAssembly instance</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We can compile Rust to WASM, and call it from Serverless functions woven into the very fabric of the Internet. That's huge and I can't wait to do more of it.</p>
	<p>There's some wrangling of the generated code required, but the tooling will improve over time. Once you've modified the glue code, calling a function in Rust generated WASM modules is just as simple as JavaScript.</p>
	<p>Are we Serverless yet? Yes we are.</p>
	<p>In a future post, I'll extract out the phrases and the UI to the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/kv">KV store</a> to show a full fledged serverless app powered by Rust and WASM.</p>
