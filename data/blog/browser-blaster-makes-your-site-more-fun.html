	<p>CloudFlare Apps already cover a wide range of services: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/snapengage">live chat</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/clicky">web analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/viglink">affiliate links</a>, and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps">too many to list</a>. These tools make your website better, and we support that wholeheartedly. (More coming next week!)</p>
	<p>But after a bit of mindless fun around the office last week, we decided to lighten up a bit. This week was focused on making our website owner customers smile -- and their website visitors, too. Why the smiles?</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/browserblaster">Browser Blaster</a>, a game you can put on your CloudFlare-powered website with a click...and<br>
		then have your visitors "blast" your website, one element at a time. (If they know your secret code!)</p>

	<p>We didn't write Browser Blaster. The credit goes to <a href="http://erikrothoff.com">Erik Rothoff Andersson</a>, the young Swedish developer whose simple riff on a classic video game captivated us.</p>
	<p>We reached out to Erik with the idea of making the game a CloudFlare App, and he thought it sounded great. We're sharing the majority of the $0.99/month revenue from Browser Blaster with Erik. Despite his generous open-source license, we enjoyed finding a way to reward inspired coding -- and we hope you feel the same.</p>
	<p>You can try Browser Blaster on the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/browserblaster">app detail page</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="somecloudflareflair">Some CloudFlare "Flair"</h3>
	<p>We started with Erik's code, and then folks here did some nifty work, adding awesome sauce wherever possible.</p>

		<li>We made Browser Blaster easy to add to your CloudFlare powered site:
			turn on the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/browserblaster">App</a>,
			for $0.99/month.</li>
		<li>Browser Blaster only shows up if your visitor knows the code. By
			default, the code is the classic Konami code. But we added a twist:
			<strong>record your own secret code</strong>. If you don't want to hide the
			magic, you can set Browser Blaster to Automatic Mode, visible to
			every site visitor at the top left.
		</li>
		<li>We made it easy for your players to Tweet and Facebook Like your
			site in the game.</li>
		<li>We put the game on our global content delivery network (CDN) and
			made sure it loads after the rest of your site. No performance hit,
			for guilt-free gaming!</li>
