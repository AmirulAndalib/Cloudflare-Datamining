	<p>Since January, Cloudflare has been running a small, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/help-us-test-our-dnssec-implementation">private beta</a> for DNSSEC. Starting today, the DNSSEC beta is open for everyone. To request access, email <a href="mailto:dnssec-beta@cloudflare.com">dnssec-beta@cloudflare.com</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="abackgroundondnsanddnssec">A Background on DNS and DNSSEC</h3>
	<p>DNS is the system that lets your browser know which web server to connect to when you request to visit a website. Itâ€™s the underlying backbone of the usable internet, and yet, is vulnerable to on-path attacker attacks.</p>
	<p>In DNS, an attacker sitting in the middle of your connection to the internet can tell your browser to connect to any web server theyâ€™d like. Browsers trust any DNS records they receive as a response to a DNS query, because DNS, invented in 1983 before the public consumption of the Internet, does not perform any authentication.</p>
	<p>There is a solution. Itâ€™s called DNSSEC and it adds cryptographic hashes and signatures for authenticating DNS records. You can read more about DNSSEC and how it works in a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dnssec-an-introduction">previous blog post</a>.</p>
	<p>The DNSSEC beta is open to all websites that use CloudFlare for DNS. If you want to be a part of our beta and be one of the first CloudFlare websites with DNSSEC, email us for beta access: <a href="mailto:dnssec-beta@cloudflare.com">dnssec-beta@cloudflare.com</a>.</p>
