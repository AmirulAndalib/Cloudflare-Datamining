	<p>Today, we‚Äôre excited to announce that we are partnering with Hugging Face to make AI models more accessible and affordable than ever before to developers.</p>
	<p>There are three things we look forward to making available to developers over the coming months:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>We‚Äôre excited to bring serverless GPU models to Hugging Face ‚Äî no more wrangling infrastructure or paying for unused capacity. Just pick your model, and go;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Bringing popular Hugging Face optimized models to Cloudflare‚Äôs model catalog;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Introduce Cloudflare integrations as a part of Hugging Face‚Äôs Inference solutions.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Hosting over 500,000 models and serving over one million model downloads a day, Hugging Face is the go-to place for developers to add AI to their applications.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, over the past six years at Cloudflare, our goal has been to make it as easy as possible for developers to bring their ideas and applications to life on our developer platform.</p>
	<p>As AI has become a critical part of every application, this partnership has felt like a natural match to put tools in the hands of developers to make deploying AI easy and affordable.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><i>‚ÄúHugging Face and Cloudflare both share a deep focus on making the latest AI innovations as accessible and affordable as possible for developers. We‚Äôre excited to offer serverless GPU services in partnership with Cloudflare to help developers scale their AI apps from zero to global, with no need to wrangle infrastructure or predict the future needs of your application ‚Äî just pick your model and deploy.‚Äù‚Äî </i><b><i>Clem Delangue</i></b><i>, CEO of Hugging Face.</i></p>

	<p>We‚Äôre excited to share what‚Äôs to come, so we wanted to give you a sneak peek into what‚Äôs ahead.</p>

	<p>As a developer, when you have an idea, you want to be able to act on it as quickly as possible. Through our partnership, we‚Äôre excited to provide you with familiar models, regardless of where you‚Äôre getting started.</p>
	<p>If you‚Äôre using Cloudflare‚Äôs developer platform to build applications, we‚Äôre excited to bring Hugging Face models into the flow as a native part of the experience. You will soon be able to deploy Hugging Face models, optimized for performance and speed, right from Cloudflare‚Äôs dashboard.</p>
