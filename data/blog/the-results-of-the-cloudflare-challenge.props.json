We set up a nginx server with a vulnerable version of OpenSSL and challenged the community to steal its private key. The world was up to the task: two people independently retrieved private keys using the Heartbleed exploit.</p>\n<p>The first valid submission was received at 16:22:01PST by Software Engineer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/indutny\">Fedor Indutny</a>. He sent at least 2.5 million requests over the course of the day. The second was submitted at 17:12:19PST by Ilkka Mattila at NCSC-FI, who sent around a hundred thousand requests over the same period of time.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Two more confirmed winners: Rubin Xu, PhD student in the Security group of Cambridge University submitted at 04:11:09PST on 04/12; and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benmmurphy\">Ben Murphy</a>, Security Researcher submitted at 7:28:50PST on 04/12.</p>\n<p>We confirmed that all individuals used only the Heartbleed exploit to obtain the private key. We rebooted the server at 3:08PST, which may have caused the key to be available in uninitiallized heap memory as theorized in our <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/answering-the-critical-question-can-you-get-private-ssl-keys-using-heartbleed\">previous blog post</a>. It is at the discretion of the researchers to share the specifics of the techniques used.</p>\n<p>This result reminds us not to underestimate the power of the crowd and emphasizes the danger posed by this vulnerability.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
