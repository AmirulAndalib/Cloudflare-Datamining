	<p>The importance of the Cloudflare Partner Network was on full display in 2021, with record level partner growth in 2021 and aiming even higher in 2022. We’ve been listening to our partners and working to constantly strengthen our ability to deliver value for businesses of all types. An area we identified we could do better, is a program to support “service partners” that want to wrap managed and professional services around Cloudflare products. Today, we are excited to announce the next evolution of the Cloudflare Channel and Alliances Partner Program to specifically enable partners that provide services around Cloudflare products with recurring revenue streams as they equip businesses of all sizes and types with Cloudflare’s leading Zero Trust and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase" target="_blank">SASE</a> solutions.</p>

	<p>Core to enabling Services Partners are some exciting enhancements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong><strong><strong>New Program Paths</strong></strong></strong></li>
		<li><strong><strong><strong>New Managed Services Partner (MSP) Accreditation.</strong></strong></strong></li>
		<li><strong><strong><strong>New Support &amp; Go-To-Market Motions</strong></strong></strong></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="new-program-paths">New Program Paths</h2>
	<p>We have seen a 29% increase in ransom DDoS attacks over the past year and a 175% increase just <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-attack-trends-for-2021-q4">last quarter</a>. Partners continue to be on the front lines helping mitigate and prevent disruption from these events as they extend our services. Our goal for 2022 is to arm our partners with the tools to address these increased threats to their customers' infrastructure and applications, like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-helps-optimize-user-connectivity-to-microsoft-365">Office365</a>. We know the painstaking efforts that Services Partners make to build compelling offerings and provide the best customer outcomes. To that end, we’ve enhanced the Cloudflare Channel and Alliances Partner Program to not only focus on extending security, performance, and reliability to more customers, but provide a services-first approach for partners. We are committing to the growth of MSP &amp; MSSP partners who share Cloudflare’s mission of helping to build a better Internet.</p>
	<p>We’ve been building out the Cloudflare Partner Network for years, working alongside businesses of all sizes and types including our world-wide system integrator partners like Rackspace, as well as partners across EMEA, APAC like Blazeclan, and Kingsoft in China, to name a few. Working with enthusiastic, targeted partners has given us the opportunity to build a program to deliver a robust yet tailored program to support our partners’ ever-evolving needs from network transformations and application modernization, to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust" target="_blank">Zero Trust solutions</a> and onwards.</p>
	<blockquote><em>“Rackspace offers expert consultative services and 24x7 managed support based on Cloudflare’s web application security, secure Internet access, gateway and browsing technologies. With Rackspace Elastic Engineering for Security and Cloudflare's cutting-edge cloud solutions, we'll be able to help our customers fast-forward to a modern, Zero Trust approach to securing their teams, applications and infrastructure." </em><br><em>- <strong>Gary Alterson, Vice President of Security Services at Rackspace Technology</strong></em></blockquote>
	<blockquote><em>"We are excited to participate in Cloudflare's new Services Partner Program. &nbsp;Cloudflare provides the advanced cloud technology at the center of digital business models. &nbsp;As a Cloudflare MSP Elite partner, we are able to leverage their innovative cloud solutions with embedded, network edge security to give our customers single-pane-of-glass reporting and policy management across internet applications." </em><br><em>- <strong>Veeraj Thaploo, CTO, Blazeclan technologies</strong></em></blockquote>

	<p>Helping build a better Internet isn’t simple. Providing managed services for a wide range of customer types and sizes requires a targeted but ever-evolving approach. To support the new Services Program, we’ve introduced a new Certification course that provides the foundational tools for creating the Cloudflare customer experience. Course highlights include best practices for services design, implementation, and providing ongoing technical and relationship management. Services Partners provide customers with a seamless experience from implementation to configuration to ongoing services; here are some of the highlights:</p>
