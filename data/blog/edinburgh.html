	<p>Our newest data center in Edinburgh expands our current total to 139 cities globally with a Cloudflare deployment. It also brings our UK total to 3 cities, after <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/groovy-baby-cloudflares-london-data-center-no">London</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/manchester-uk-cloudflares-63rd-data-center">Manchester</a>.</p>
	<h3>The city</h3>
	<p>Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, located in the Lothian region. It has been recognised as the capital since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">15th century</a>, and is the home of the Scottish government, parliament and supreme courts. It is a city of many hills, with important landmarks such as <a href="https://www.edinburghcastle.scot">Edinburgh Castle</a> being built at the top of a hill.</p>

	<h3>Culture</h3>
	<p>One of the most famous events held each year in Edinburgh is the <a href="https://www.edfringe.com">Fringe Festival</a>, which is reported to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe">world's largest arts festival</a>. Many famous comedians have made their big break at this very festival.</p>
	<h3>Building a community</h3>
	<p>The internet community in the UK is very well established, but mostly concentrated on London and Manchester, with a heavy emphasis on London. By deploying in Edinburgh we're encouraging ISPs to regionalise their traffic, away from just London. We're connected to <a href="https://peeringdb.com/ix/745">IXScotland</a>, and are actively seeking to peer with other connected networks, to help build the peering community.</p>
	<h3>Regional expansion</h3>
