	<p>No matter what your age, it's hard to believe that the World-Wide Web is 25 today. For the young the web has always been part of their lives, for the older it seems like it was invented only yesterday. But, in truth, the World-Wide Web sprang into life in the form of a document circulated at CERN entitled <a href="http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information Management: A Proposal</a> in March 1989.</p>
	<p>The document contains a simple diagram proposing that "browsers" on heterogenous machine types would be able to access Hypertext Servers to view information.</p>
	<p><img alt="&quot;Browsers&quot;" src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/Image2.gif"></p>
	<p>In one of the great understatements of computing history, Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the proposal, wrote a parenthetical comment that allowing heterogenous machine types to access these proposed Hypertext Servers would be "a boon for the world in general".</p>
	<p>The most visible part of the explosion of the World-Wide Web is that we are all using it every day. But we don't often stop to think about the technical changes that underlie the web browsers that we use. Part of CloudFlare's work is to stay on top of the web as it changes so that everyone with a web server has the latest technology.</p>
	<p>Here's a brief timeline of significant changes in web technology.</p>
	<p>March 12, 1989: Tim Berners-Lee outlines the web in "Information Management: A Proposal"</p>
	<p>Christmas Day, 1990: Berners-Lee releases the first version of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb">WorldWideWeb</a> web browser.</p>

	<p>1991: the first HTTP standard <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html">HTTP/0.9</a> is written up. It reflects that state of HTTP as implemented by early web browsers.</p>

	<p><img alt="img" src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/Mosaic_Netscape_0.9_on_Windows_XP.png"></p>
	<p>1994: The first mobile web browser, PocketWeb for the Apple Newton, is released.</p>

	<p>And so the web continues to evolve. New specifications and new protocols are tested and defined. HTML5 is an ongoing effort, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3">CSS Level 3</a>. Google recently began experimenting with a new web protocol called <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-up-to-date-with-the-latest-protocols-spdy-3-1">QUIC</a>.</p>
	<p>CloudFlare helps customers stay on top of the ever changing web with features like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa">automatic IPv6</a>, support for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-up-to-date-with-the-latest-protocols-spdy-3-1">SPDY/3.1</a>, and complete support for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-strict-ssl-protecting-against-a-man-in-the-middle-attack-on-origin-traffic">TLS</a>.</p>
	<p>25 years on the web is still growing, evolving and changing. Here's to 25 more years!</p>
	<p>PS If reading that list of changes wasn't enough nostalgia for you... <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">visit the web page that got it all started</a>.</p>
	<p>When Tim Berners-Lee wrote the original proposal he sent it to his boss. His boss wrote on the top of it <a href="http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html">Vague but exciting...</a>. It did turn out to be the latter!</p>
