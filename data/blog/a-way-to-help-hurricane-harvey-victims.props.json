Although Harvey's category was quickly downgraded, the storm lingered around for days, bringing 50 inches of rain to the greater Houston area.</p>\n<p>As someone who was born in Houston, it's hard to see my former city hit with such destruction, and to know that many of my friends and fellow Houstonians are in need of help and assistance. Many families have had their entire house flooded out by the storm. Displaced residents are in a state of stagnation and are seeing their supplies diminishing by the day.</p>\n<p>The Hurricane Relief app will allow visitors to your site to donate to one of the charities helping those impacted in Houston:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/hurricane-relief\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2017/08/hurricane-relief-screenshot-1-1.png\" alt=\"screenshot of app\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n<p>The Hurricane Relief App takes two clicks to install and requires no code change.
