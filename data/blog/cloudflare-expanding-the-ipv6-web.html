	<p>We regularly monitor the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa top 1 million websites</a> for trends. Specifically, we've been tracking how many of them support IPv6 connections. The numbers are still low but have been improving. About 1% of the 1 million largest websites on the Internet now accept and properly support IPv6 connections. What's pretty cool is that <strong>about 10% of those that do accept IPv6 connections do so via <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa">CloudFlare's free Automatic IPv6 Gateway</a></strong>. There's a long way to go, but we're proud of our part of expanding the modern Internet.</p>
