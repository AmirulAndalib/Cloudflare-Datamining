		<li><strong><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/56471">Innovating Like the “Early Days” 5+ years Later</a></strong><br>
			Innovating is easy in the early days--especially without the legacy systems, prior customer commitments, or formal internal processes that come with time. Fast forward and you have more employees, customers, commitments, internal silos, and business goals than ever before. How do you maintain the agile innovation pace you had early on? This panel of builders and visionaries will share how they stay laser focused on what’s over the horizon, avoiding incrementalism. They’ll share how they keep their teams paving the way for others to follow.</li>
