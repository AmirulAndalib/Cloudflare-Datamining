	<p>We're excited to announce that we just got word that Cloudflare won the2009 Harvard Business Plan competition. We're extremely excited andflattered by the recognition. The competition was a terrific experiencefor Michelle and me. The process of putting together the plan helped usunderstand where the real need in the market for a new performance andsecurity solution was -- for small- to mid-sized sites -- as well as tocome up with a way to deploy a solution that met the needs of thosesites. We have had a ton of in-bound interest from venture capital firmswho want to work with us on taking Cloudflare from a plan to a product.Stay tuned for what's next!</p>
