	<p>We caught up with Ryan at HostingCon where we talked about Basekit, where he's seeing growth in the industry, and what their customers are saying.</p>
	<p>"We have a platform for small businesses to get online. At the very basic part of that it is getting a website and getting a template that is relevant to what customers are doing," said Ryan. "We try to make that as slick and easy as possible."</p>
	<p>Basekit provides customers with everything they need to create a professional website in an easy to use, completely customisable way. No coding required.</p>
	<p>"The biggest thing, the reason they are picking Basekit, is that there's a ton of flexibility there," said Ryan.</p>
	<p>Basekit's customers span from photography sites to ecommerce sites to small businesses of all kinds.</p>
	<p>"It's a wild and wooly mix of small businesses out there," said Ryan.</p>
