	<p>Today, we are excited to announce an expansion we’ve been working on behind the scenes for the last two years: a 25+ city partnership with one of the largest ISPs in Brazil. This is one of the largest simultaneous single-country expansions we’ve done so far.</p>
	<p>With this partnership, Brazilians throughout the country will see significant improvement to their Internet experience. Already, the 25th-percentile latency of non-bot traffic (we use that measure as an approximation of physical distance from our servers to end users) has dropped from the mid-20 millisecond range to sub-10 milliseconds. This benefit extends not only to the 25 million Internet properties on our network, but to the entire Internet with Cloudflare services like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111">1.1.1.1</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn">WARP</a>. We expect that as we approach 25 cities in Brazil, latency will continue to drop while throughput increases.</p>

	<p>This partnership is part of our mission to help create a better Internet and the best development experience for all — not just those in major population centers or in Western markets — and we are excited to take this step on our journey to help build a better Internet. Whether you live in the heart of São Paulo or the outskirts of the Amazon rainforest in Manaus, expect an upgrade to your Internet experience soon.</p>
	<p>We have already launched in <b>Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Campinas, Curitiba,</b> and <b>Fortaleza</b>, with additional presences coming soon to <b>Manaus, São Paulo, Blumenau, Joinville, Florianópolis, Itajai, Belém, Goiânia, Salvador, São José do Rio Preto</b>, <b>Americana</b>, and <b>Sorocaba</b>.</p>
	<p>From there, we’re planning on adding presences in the following cities: <b>Guarulhos, Mogi das Cruzes, São José dos Campos, Vitória, Londrina, Maringá, Campina Grande, Caxias do Sul, Cuiabá, Lajeado, Natal, Recife, Osasco, Santo André</b>, and <b>Rio</b>. The result will be a net expansion of Cloudflare in Brazil by <i>12 to 16 times</i>.</p>
	<p>We celebrate the benefits that this partnership will bring to Latin America. Our President and Chief Operating Officer Michelle Zatlyn likes to say that “<i>we’re just getting started</i>”. In that spirit, expect more exciting news about the Cloudflare network not only in Latin America, but worldwide!</p>
