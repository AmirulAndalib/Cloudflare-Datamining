	<p>Today, we are excited to announce an expansion weâ€™ve been working on behind the scenes for the last two years: a 25+ city partnership with one of the largest ISPs in Brazil. This is one of the largest simultaneous single-country expansions weâ€™ve done so far.</p>
	<p>With this partnership, Brazilians throughout the country will see significant improvement to their Internet experience. Already, the 25th-percentile latency of non-bot traffic (we use that measure as an approximation of physical distance from our servers to end users) has dropped from the mid-20 millisecond range to sub-10 milliseconds. This benefit extends not only to the 25 million Internet properties on our network, but to the entire Internet with Cloudflare services like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111">1.1.1.1</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn">WARP</a>. We expect that as we approach 25 cities in Brazil, latency will continue to drop while throughput increases.</p>

	<p>This partnership is part of our mission to help create a better Internet and the best development experience for all â€” not just those in major population centers or in Western markets â€” and we are excited to take this step on our journey to help build a better Internet. Whether you live in the heart of SÃ£o Paulo or the outskirts of the Amazon rainforest in Manaus, expect an upgrade to your Internet experience soon.</p>
	<p>We have already launched in <strong>Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, BrasÃ­lia, Campinas, Curitiba, </strong>and <strong>Fortaleza</strong>, with additional presences coming soon to <strong>Manaus, SÃ£o Paulo, Blumenau, Joinville, FlorianÃ³polis, Itajai, BelÃ©m, GoiÃ¢nia, Salvador, SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto</strong>, <strong>Americana</strong>, and <strong>Sorocaba</strong>.</p>
	<p>From there, weâ€™re planning on adding presences in the following cities: <strong>Guarulhos, Mogi das Cruzes, SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos, VitÃ³ria, Londrina, MaringÃ¡, Campina Grande, Caxias do Sul, CuiabÃ¡, Lajeado, Natal, Recife, Osasco, Santo AndrÃ©</strong>, and <strong>Rio</strong>. The result will be a net expansion of Cloudflare in Brazil by <em>12 to 16 times</em>.</p>
	<p>We celebrate the benefits that this partnership will bring to Latin America. Our President and Chief Operating Officer Michelle Zatlyn likes to say that â€œ<em>weâ€™re just getting started</em>â€. In that spirit, expect more exciting news about the Cloudflare network not only in Latin America, but worldwide!</p>
