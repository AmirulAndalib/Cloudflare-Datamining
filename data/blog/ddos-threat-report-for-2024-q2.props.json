Short for <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">Distributed Denial of Service</a>, a DDoS attack is a type of cyber attack designed to take down or disrupt Internet services, such as websites or mobile apps, making them unavailable to users. This is typically achieved by overwhelming the victim's server with more traffic than it can handle — usually from multiple sources across the Internet, rendering it unable to handle legitimate user traffic.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diagram of a DDoS attack\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"849\"><figcaption>Diagram of a DDoS attack</figcaption></figure><p>To learn more about DDoS attacks and other types of cyber threats, visit our <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/\">Learning Center</a>, access <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/ddos-reports\">previous DDoS threat reports</a> on the Cloudflare blog or visit our interactive hub, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports?q=DDoS\">Cloudflare Radar</a>.

Overall, the number of DDoS attacks in Q2 decreased by 11% quarter-over-quarter, but increased 20% year-over-year.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--1--3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Distribution of DDoS attacks by types and vectors\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1480\" height=\"819\"><figcaption>Distribution of DDoS attacks by types and vectors</figcaption></figure><p>For context, in the entire year of 2023, we mitigated 14 million DDoS attacks, and halfway through 2024, we have already mitigated 60% of last year’s figure.</p><p>Cloudflare successfully mitigated 10.2 trillion HTTP DDoS requests and 57 petabytes of network-layer DDoS attack traffic, preventing it from reaching our customers’ origin servers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--2--2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"DDoS attacks stats for 2024 Q2\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1508\" height=\"846\"><figcaption>DDoS attacks stats for 2024 Q2</figcaption></figure><p>When we break it down further, those 4 million DDoS attacks were composed of 2.2 million network-layer DDoS attacks and 1.8 million HTTP DDoS attacks. This number of 1.8 million HTTP DDoS attacks has been normalized to compensate for the explosion in sophisticated and randomized HTTP DDoS attacks. Our automated mitigation systems generate real-time fingerprints for DDoS attacks, and due to the randomized nature of these sophisticated attacks, we observed many fingerprints being generated for single attacks. The actual number of fingerprints that was generated was closer to 19 million – over ten times larger than the normalized figure of 1.8 million. The millions of fingerprints that were generated to deal with the randomization stemmed from a few single rules. These rules did their job to stop attacks, but they inflated the numbers, so we excluded them from the calculation.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--3--2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"HTTP DDoS attacks by quarter, with the excluded fingerprints\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1140\" height=\"675\"><figcaption>HTTP DDoS attacks by quarter, with the excluded fingerprints</figcaption></figure><p>This ten-fold difference underscores the dramatic change in the threat landscape. The tools and capabilities that allowed threat actors to carry out such randomized and sophisticated attacks were previously associated with capabilities reserved for state-level actors or state-sponsored actors. But, coinciding with the rise of generative AI and autopilot systems that can help actors write better code faster, these capabilities have made their way to the common cyber criminal.</p><h2 id=\"ransom-ddos-attacks\">Ransom DDoS attacks</h2><p>In May 2024, the percentage of attacked Cloudflare customers that reported being threatened by a DDoS attack threat actor, or subjected to a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ransom-ddos-attack/\">Ransom DDoS attack</a> reached 16% – the highest it’s been in the past 12 months. The quarter started relatively low, at 7% of customers reporting a threat or a ransom attack. That quickly jumped to 16% in May and slightly dipped in June to 14%.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--4--2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Percentage of customers reporting DDoS threats or ransom extortion (by month)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1325\" height=\"778\"><figcaption>Percentage of customers reporting DDoS threats or ransom extortion (by month)</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, ransom DDoS attacks have been increasing quarter over quarter throughout the past year.

SYN floods and RST floods are both types of TCP-based DDoS attacks. Collectively, all types of TCP-based DDoS attacks accounted for 38% of all network-layer DDoS attacks.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--11--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Top attack vectors (network-layer)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"922\"><figcaption>Top attack vectors (network-layer)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"http-ddos-attack-vectors\">HTTP DDoS attack vectors</h3><p>One of the advantages of operating a large network is that we see a lot of traffic and attacks. This helps us improve our detection and mitigation systems to protect our customers. In the last quarter, half of all <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/http-flood-ddos-attack/\">HTTP DDoS attacks</a> were mitigated using proprietary heuristics that targeted botnets known to Cloudflare. These heuristics guide our systems on how to generate a real-time fingerprint to match against the attacks.</p><p>Another 29% were HTTP DDoS attacks that used fake user agents, impersonated browsers, or were from headless browsers. An additional 13% had suspicious HTTP attributes which triggered our automated system, and 7% were marked as generic floods. One thing to note is that these attack vectors, or attack groups, are not necessarily exclusive. For example, known botnets also impersonate browsers and have suspicious HTTP attributes, but this breakdown is our initial attempt to categorize the HTTP DDoS attacks.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--12-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Top attack vectors (HTTP)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1161\" height=\"663\"><figcaption>Top attack vectors (HTTP)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"http-versions-used-in-ddos-attacks\">HTTP versions used in DDoS attacks</h3><p>In Q2, around half of all web traffic used HTTP/2, 29% used HTTP/1.1, an additional fifth used HTTP/3, nearly 0.62% used HTTP/1.0, and 0.01% for HTTP/1.2.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--13-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Distribution of web traffic by HTTP version\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1116\" height=\"688\"><figcaption>Distribution of web traffic by HTTP version</figcaption></figure><p>HTTP DDoS attacks follow a similar pattern in terms of version adoption, albeit a larger bias towards HTTP/2. 76% of HTTP DDoS attack traffic was over the HTTP/2 version and nearly 22% over HTTP/1.1. HTTP/3, on the other hand, saw a much smaller usage. Only 0.86% of HTTP DDoS attack traffic were over HTTP/3 — as opposed to its much broader adoption of 20% by all web traffic.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--14-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Distribution of HTTP DDoS attack traffic by HTTP version\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1074\" height=\"687\"><figcaption>Distribution of HTTP DDoS attack traffic by HTTP version</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"ddos-attack-duration\">DDoS attack duration</h3><p>The vast majority of DDoS attacks are short. Over 57% of HTTP DDoS attacks and 88% of network-layer DDoS attacks end within 10 minutes or less. This emphasizes the need for automated, in-line detection and mitigation systems. Ten minutes are hardly enough time for a human to respond to an alert, analyze the traffic, and apply manual mitigations.</p><p>On the other side of the graphs, we can see that approximately a quarter of HTTP DDoS attacks last over an hour, and almost a fifth last more than a day. On the network layer, longer attacks are significantly less common. Only 1% of network-layer DDoS attacks last more than 3 hours.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--15-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"HTTP DDoS attacks: distribution by duration\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"916\"><figcaption>HTTP DDoS attacks: distribution by duration</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--16-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Network-layer DDoS attacks: distribution by duration\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"920\"><figcaption>Network-layer DDoS attacks: distribution by duration</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"ddos-attack-size\">DDoS attack size</h3><p>Most DDoS attacks are relatively small. Over 95% of network-layer DDoS attacks stay below 500 megabits per second, and 86% stay below 50,000 packets per second.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--17-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Distribution of network-layer DDoS attacks by bit rate\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"919\"><figcaption>Distribution of network-layer DDoS attacks by bit rate</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--18-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Distribution of network-layer DDoS attacks by packet rate\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"914\"><figcaption>Distribution of network-layer DDoS attacks by packet rate</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, 81% of HTTP DDoS attacks stay below 50,000 requests per second. Although these rates are small on Cloudflare’s scale, they can still be devastating for unprotected websites unaccustomed to such traffic levels.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--19-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Distribution of HTTP DDoS attacks by request rate\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"923\"><figcaption>Distribution of HTTP DDoS attacks by request rate</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the majority of attacks being small, the number of larger volumetric attacks has increased. One out of every 100 network-layer DDoS attacks exceed 1 million packets per second (pps), and two out of every 100 exceed 500 gigabits per second. On layer 7, four out of every 1,000 HTTP DDoS attacks exceed 1 million requests per second.</p><h2 id=\"key-takeaways\">Key takeaways</h2><p>The majority of DDoS attacks are small and quick. However, even these attacks can disrupt online services that do not follow<a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/best-practices/respond-to-ddos-attacks/\"> best practices for DDoS defense</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, threat actor sophistication is increasing, perhaps due to the availability of Generative AI and developer copilot tools, resulting in attack code that delivers DDoS attacks that are harder to defend against. Even prior to the rise in attack sophistication, many organizations struggled to defend against these threats on their own. But they don’t need to. Cloudflare is here to help. We invest significant resources – so you don’t have to – to ensure our automated defenses, along with the entire portfolio of Cloudflare security products, to protect against existing and emerging threats.</p>",
