Just a few years ago, serverless functions were revolutionary. Today, entire applications are built on serverless architectures, from compute to databases, storage, queues, etc. — with Cloudflare leading the way in making it easier than ever for developers to build, without having to think about their architecture. And while the adoption of serverless has made it simple for developers to run fast, it has also made one of the most difficult problems in software even harder: how the heck do you unravel the behavior of distributed systems? </p><p>When I started Baselime 2 years ago, our goal was simple: enable every developer to build, ship, and learn from their serverless applications such that they can resolve issues before they become problems.</p><p>Since then, we built an observability platform that enables developers to understand the behaviour of their cloud applications. It’s designed for high cardinality and dimensionality data, from logs to distributed tracing with<a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\"> OpenTelemetry</a>. With this data, we automatically surface insights from your applications, and enable you to quickly detect, troubleshoot, and resolve issues in production.</p><p>In parallel, Cloudflare has been busy the past few years building the next frontier of cloud computing: the connectivity cloud. The team is building primitives that enable developers to build applications with a completely new set of paradigms, from Workers to D1, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/\">R2</a>, Queues, KV, Durable Objects, AI, and all the other services available on the Cloudflare Developers Platform. </p><p>This synergy makes Cloudflare the perfect home for Baselime. Our core mission has always been to simplify and innovate around observability for the future of the cloud, and Cloudflare's ecosystem offers the ideal ground to further this cause. With Cloudflare, we're positioned to deeply integrate into a platform that tens of thousands of developers trust and use daily, enabling them to quickly build, ship, and troubleshoot applications. We believe that every Worker, Queue, KV, Durable Object, AI call, etc. should have built-in observability by default.</p><p>That’s why we’re incredibly excited about the potential of what we can build together and the impact it will have on developers around the world.</p><p>To give you a preview into what’s ahead, I wanted to dive deeper into the 3 core concepts we followed while building Baselime.</p><h3 id=\"high-cardinality-and-dimensionality\">High Cardinality and Dimensionality</h3><p>Cardinality and dimensionality are best described using examples. Imagine you’re playing a board game with a deck of cards. High cardinality is like playing a game where every card is a unique character, making it hard to remember or match them. And high dimensionality is like each card has tons of details like strength, speed, magic, aura, etc., making the game's strategy complex because there's so much to consider.</p><p>This also applies to the data your application emits. For example, when you log an HTTP request that makes database calls.</p><ul><li>High cardinality means that your logs can have a unique <code>userId</code> or <code>requestId</code> (which can take millions of distinct values). Those are high cardinality fields.</li><li>High dimensionality means that your logs can have thousands of possible fields. You can record each HTTP header of your request and the details of each database call. Any log can be a key-value object with thousands of individual keys.</li></ul><p>The ability to query on high cardinality and dimensionality fields is key to modern observability. You can surface all errors or requests for a specific user, compute the duration of each of those requests, and group by location. You can answer all of those questions with a single tool.</p><h3 id=\"opentelemetry\">OpenTelemetry</h3><p><a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry</a> provides a common set of tools, APIs, SDKs, and standards for instrumenting applications. It is a game-changer for debugging and understanding cloud applications. You get to see the big picture: how fast your HTTP APIs are, which routes are experiencing the most errors, or which database queries are slowest. You can also get into the details by following the path of a single request or user across your entire application.</p><p>Baselime is OpenTelemetry native, and it is built from the ground up to leverage OpenTelemetry data. To support this, we built a set of OpenTelemetry SDKs compatible with several serverless runtimes.</p><p>Cloudflare is building the cloud of tomorrow and has developed <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd\">workerd</a>, a modern JavaScript runtime for Workers. With Cloudflare, we are considering embedding OpenTelemetry directly in the Workers’ runtime. That’s one more reason we’re excited to grow further at Cloudflare, enabling more developers to understand their applications, even in the most unconventional scenarios.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0--8-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\"></figure><h3 id=\"developer-experience\">Developer Experience</h3><p>Observability without action is just storage. I have seen too many developers pay for tools to store logs and metrics they never use, and the key reason is how opaque these tools are.</p><p>The crux of the issue in modern observability isn’t the technology itself, but rather the developer experience. Many tools are complex, with a significant learning curve. This friction reduces the speed at which developers can identify and resolve issues, ultimately affecting the reliability of their applications. Improving developer experience is key to unlocking the full potential of observability.</p><p>We built Baselime to be an exploratory solution that surfaces insights to you rather than requiring you to dig for them. For example, we notify you in real time when errors are discovered in your application, based on your logs and traces. You can quickly search through all of your data with full-text search, or using our powerful query engine, which makes it easy to correlate logs and traces for increased visibility, or ask our AI debugging assistant for insights on the issue you’re investigating.</p><p>It is always possible to go from one insight to another, asking questions about the state of your app iteratively until you get to the root cause of the issue you are troubleshooting.</p><p>Cloudflare has always prioritised the developer experience of its developer platform, especially with <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/\">Wrangler</a>, and we are convinced it’s the right place to solve the developer experience problem of observability.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/04/pasted-image-0-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"view distributed traces\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\"></figure><h3 id=\"what%E2%80%99s-next\">What’s next?</h3><p>Over the next few months, we’ll work to bring the core of Baselime into the Cloudflare ecosystem, starting with OpenTelemetry, real-time error tracking, and all the developer experience capabilities that make a great observability solution. We will keep building and improving observability for applications deployed outside Cloudflare because we understand that observability should work across providers.</p><p>But we don’t want to stop there. We want to push the boundaries of what modern observability looks like. For instance, directly connecting to your codebase and correlating insights from your logs and traces to functions and classes in your codebase. We also want to enable more AI capabilities beyond our debugging assistant. We want to deeply integrate with your repositories such that you can go from an error in your logs and traces to a Pull Request in your codebase within minutes.</p><p>We also want to enable everyone building on top of Large Language Models to do all your LLM observability directly within Cloudflare, such that you can optimise your prompts, improve latencies and reduce error rates directly within your cloud provider. These are just a handful of capabilities we can now build with the support of the Cloudflare platform.</p><h3 id=\"thanks\">Thanks</h3><p>We are incredibly thankful to our community for its continued support, from day 0 to today. With your continuous feedback, you’ve helped us build something we’re incredibly proud of.</p><p>To all the developers currently using Baselime, you’ll be able to keep using the product and will receive ongoing support. Also, we are now making all the paid Baselime features completely free.</p><p>Baselime products remain available to sign up for while we work on integrating with the Cloudflare platform. We anticipate sunsetting the Baselime products towards the end of 2024 when you will be able to observe all of your applications within the Cloudflare dashboard. If you're interested in staying up-to-date on our work with Cloudflare, we will release a signup link in the coming weeks!</p><p>We are looking forward to continuing to innovate with you.</p>",
