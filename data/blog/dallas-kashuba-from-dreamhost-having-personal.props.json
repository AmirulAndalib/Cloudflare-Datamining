They were inspired by all the possibilities of the web and wanted to bring that to as many people as possible. He's also a musician and all-around fun guy.</p>\n<p>The fun guy has definitely transcended into the DreamHost culture. One of the largest hosting providers in the world, DreamHost is known for its fun atmosphere and laid-back employees.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think it's good to expose a little bit of your culture back out [to the public]. I don't think it hurts your product,&quot; said Dallas.</p>\n<p>DreamHost, who issues a hilariously popular newsletter and doesn't shy away from the creative, shows a lot of personality in most of their work. They consider their customers &quot;fans&quot; and even hosted a &quot;reach out and touch you&quot; tour earlier this year.</p>\n<p>&quot;Having personality helps build the brand and have a differential,&quot; said Dallas.</p>\n<p>It's not all fun and games for DreamHost though. As one of the most popular hosting providers out there, they are focusing on building a better product and expanding their network.</p>\n<p>In the fall, DreamHost will be bringing on a new, east coast data center in Virginia to grow their network and better serve their customers. They are also developing a cloud computing service that is currently in alpha and scheduled to hit beta later this year.</p>\n<p><em>At HostingCon 2012, <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/\">CloudFlare</a> co-founder <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/zatlyn\">Michelle Zatlyn</a> sat down with 28 leading experts in the hosting industry. Their conversations were captured live and offer insight into the latest trends and news in hosting.</em></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
