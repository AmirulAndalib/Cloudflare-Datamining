	<p>At the end of March, <a href="https://twitter.com/KentonVarda">Kenton Varda</a>, tech lead and architect for <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers">Cloudflare Workers</a>, traveled to London and led a talk about the <a href="https://edgecomputelondon.eventbrite.com">Rise of Edge Compute</a> where he laid out our vision for the future of the Internet as a platform.</p>
