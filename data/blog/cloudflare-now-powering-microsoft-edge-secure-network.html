	<p>Between third-party cookies that track your activity across websites, to highly targeted advertising based on your IP address and browsing data, it's no secret that todayâ€™s Internet browsing experience isnâ€™t as private as it should be. Here at Cloudflare, we believe everyone should be able to browse the Internet free of persistent tracking and prying eyes.</p>
	<p>Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re excited to announce that weâ€™ve partnered with Microsoft Edge to provide a fast and secure VPN, right in the browser. Users donâ€™t have to install anything new or understand complex concepts to get the latest in network-level privacy: Edge Secure Network VPN is available on the latest consumer version of Microsoft Edge in most markets, and automatically comes with 5 GB of data. Just enable the feature by going to <em>[Microsoft Edge Settings &amp; more (â€¦) &gt; Browser essentials, </em>and click <em>Get VPN for free]</em>. See Microsoftâ€™s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/edge-secure-network-vpn?form=MT00D8">Edge Secure Network page</a> for more details.</p>

	<p>To take a step back: a VPN is a way in which the Internet traffic leaving your device is tunneled through an intermediary server operated by a provider â€“ in this case, Cloudflare! There are many important pieces that make this possible, but among them is the VPN<em> </em>protocol, which defines the way in which the tunnel is established and how traffic flows through it. You may have heard of some of these protocols: Wireguard, IPsec, and OpenVPN, for example. And while weâ€™re no stranger to these, (Cloudflareâ€™s WireGuard implementation is currently in use by millions of devices that use <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn">1.1.1.1+WARP</a>) â€“ we see our Privacy Proxy Platform as a way to push forward the next frontier of Internet privacy and embrace one of Cloudflareâ€™s core values: open Internet standards.</p>
	<p>The Privacy Proxy Platform implements HTTP CONNECT, a method defined in the <a href="http://placeholder">HTTP standard</a> that proxies traffic by establishing a tunnel and then sending reliable and ordered byte streams through that tunnel. You can read more about this proxying method (and its history!) in our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-primer-on-proxies">Primer on Proxies</a>.</p>
	<p>We also leverage other parts of Cloudflareâ€™s privacy-oriented infrastructure that are already deployed at scale: requests first utilize <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns">1.1.1.1</a> for DNS, a token proxy based on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/privacypass/about">Privacy Pass</a> for client authentication, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network">Geo-egress</a> to choose an accurate egress IP address without exposing usersâ€™ precise location.</p>
	<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
	<p>Letâ€™s dive into the details of these components. For the purposes of this blog, weâ€™ll call the devices people are using to browse the Internet (your phone, tablet or computer) <em>clients, </em>and the websites theyâ€™re trying to visit <em>origin sites.</em></p>
	<p>The Privacy Proxy Platform includes three main parts:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Token Proxy</strong>: this is the service that checks if youâ€™re an Edge Secure Network user with a legitimate Microsoft account.</li>
		<li><strong>Privacy API</strong>: based on the above, Cloudflareâ€™s Privacy API issues authentication tokens that clients use for authenticating to the proxy itself.</li>
		<li><strong>Privacy Proxy</strong>: this is the HTTP CONNECT-based proxy service running on Cloudflareâ€™s network. This service checks that the client presents a valid authentication token, and if so, proxies the encrypted HTTP request to the origin site. It is also responsible for selecting a valid egress IP address to be used.</li>
	</ol>
	<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image2-24.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="897"></figure>
	<p>When Edge Secure Network protections are on â€“ say, when a user connects to an open Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop â€“ our proxy will automatically prompt that client for a token to authenticate. If the client has a token, it will present one. If it doesnâ€™t, it will utilize the token proxy to mint a new pool using the help of an attester and issuer: the attester checks the validity of the client and Microsoft account, and the issuer issues tokens for that client in return. This dance is based on the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/supporting-the-latest-version-of-the-privacy-pass-protocol">Privacy Pass protocol</a>. Importantly, it allows Cloudflare to validate that clients are who they say they are without collecting or storing personal information from Microsoft users.</p>
	<p>Once the client has presented the proxy server with a valid token, the Privacy Proxy then chooses a valid egress IP address based on a hash of the clientâ€™s geolocation. It then uses the DNS record (provided by Cloudflareâ€™s DNS resolver, <a href="https://1.1.1.1">1.1.1.1</a>) to open up an encrypted session to the origin website. From there, itâ€™s pretty straightforward: if the user continues to browse on that site, further requests will be sent through that connection, if they stop or close the browser, that connection will close as well.</p>
	<p>Because Cloudflare proxies millions of requests per second, many of the operational aspects of the proxy are managed by <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-oxy">Oxy</a>, our proxying framework that handles everything from telemetry, graceful restarts, to stream multiplexing and IP fallbacks, and authentication <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/oxy-extensibility">hooks</a>.</p>

	<p>Cloudflareâ€™s privacy proxy implementation maximizes user experience without sacrificing privacy. When Edge Secure Network is enabled, users will have search and browsing results relevant to where theyâ€™re geographically located. At Cloudflare, we call this the pizza test: people should be able to use any of our privacy proxy products and still be able to get results for â€œ<em>pizza places near me</em>â€. We accomplish this by always egressing through a Cloudflare data center that has an IP address that corresponds to the userâ€™s location â€“ weâ€™ve written more about how we did this for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network">1.1.1.1+WARP</a>.</p>
	<p>Unlike your typical VPN operator that has dozens â€“ sometimes hundreds â€“ of servers, Cloudflare has a much larger footprint: data centers in <a href="https://cloudflare.com/network">over 300 cities</a>. Because our network is an anycast â€œevery service, everywhereâ€ approach, each of our data centers can accept traffic from an Edge Secure network client. This means that Edge users will automatically detect and connect with a Cloudflare data center geographically very close to them, minimizing last-mile latency. Finally, because Cloudflare also operates a CDN, websites that are already on Cloudflare will be given a â€œhot-path,â€ and will load faster.</p>
	<p>We at Cloudflare are always striving to bring more privacy options to the open Internet, and we are excited to provide more private and secure browsing to Edge users.
