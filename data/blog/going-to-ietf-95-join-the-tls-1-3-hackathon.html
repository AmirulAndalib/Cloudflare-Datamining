	<p>If youâ€™re in Buenos Aires on April 2-3 and are interested in building, come join the <a href="https://ietf.org/hackathon/95-hackathon.html">IETF Hackathon</a>. CloudFlare and Mozilla will be working on TLS 1.3, the first new version of TLS in eight years!</p>
	<p>At the hackathon weâ€™ll be focusing on implementing the latest draft of TLS 1.3 and testing interoperability between <a href="https://github.com/tlswg/tls13-spec/wiki/Implementations">existing implementations</a> written in C, Go, OCaml, JavaScript and F*. If you have experience with network programming and cryptography, come hack on the latest and greatest protocol and help find problems before it is finalized. If youâ€™re planning on attending, add your name to the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/registration/MeetingWiki/wiki/95hackathon">Hackathon wiki</a>. If you canâ€™t make it, but implementing cryptographic protocols is your cup of tea, apply to join the <a href="https://careers.jobscore.com/careers/cloudflare/jobs/cryptography-engineer-c0wW9i590r5BqSeMg-44q7">CloudFlare team</a>!</p>
	<p>Weâ€™re very excited about TLS 1.3, which brings both security and performance improvements to HTTPS. In fact, if you have a client that speaks TLS 1.3 draft 10, you can read this blog on our TLS 1.3 mirror: tls13.cloudflare.com.</p>
	<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
