They are platforms that allow two networks to interconnect privately at layer 2, without requiring additional physical cabling. Instead the customer can order a port and a virtual connection on a dashboard, and the interconnection ‘fabric’ will establish the connection. Since many large customers are already connected to these fabrics for their connections to traditional Cloud providers, it is a very convenient method to establish private connectivity with Cloudflare.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/07/BDES-687_Hero_Image_for_Web_Page_of_New_Partner_Program.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"why-interconnect-virtually\">Why interconnect virtually?</h3><p>Cloudflare has an extensive <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-peering-portal-beta/\">peering</a> infrastructure and already has private links to thousands of other networks. Virtual private interconnection is particularly attractive to customers with strict security postures and demanding performance requirements, but without the added burden of ordering and managing additional physical cross connects and expanding their physical infrastructure.</p><h3 id=\"key-benefits-of-interconnection-platforms\">Key Benefits of Interconnection Platforms</h3><p><strong>Secure</strong><br>Similar to physical PNI,<strong> </strong>traffic does not pass across the Internet. Rather, it flows from the customer router, to the Interconnection Platform’s network and ultimately to Cloudflare. So while there is still some element of shared infrastructure, it’s not over the public Internet.</p><p><strong>Efficient</strong><br>Modern PNIs are typically a minimum of 1Gbps, but if you have the security motivation without the sustained 1Gbps data transfer rates, then you will have idle capacity. Virtual connections provide for “sub-rate” speeds, which means less than 1Gbps, such as 100Mbps, meaning you only pay for what you use. Most providers also allow some level of “burstiness”, which is to say you can exceed that 100Mbps limit for short periods.</p><p><strong>Performance</strong><br>By avoiding the public Internet, virtual links avoid Internet congestion.</p><p><strong>Price</strong><br>The major cloud providers typically have different pricing for egressing data to the Internet compared to an Interconnect Platform. By connecting to your cloud via an Interconnect Partner, you can benefit from those reduced egress fees between your cloud and the Interconnection Platform. This builds on our<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/\"> Bandwidth Alliance</a> to give customers more options to continue to drive down their network costs.</p><p><strong>Less Overhead</strong><br>By virtualizing, you reduce physical cable management to just one connection into the Interconnection Platform. From there, everything defined and managed in software. For example, ordering a 100Mbps link to Cloudflare can be a few clicks in a Dashboard, as would be a 100Mbps link into Salesforce.</p><p><strong>Data Center Independence</strong><br>Is your infrastructure in the same metro, but in a different facility to Cloudflare? An Interconnection Platform can bring us together without the need for additional physical links.</p><h3 id=\"where-can-i-connect\">Where can I connect?</h3><ol><li>In any of our <a href=\"https://www.peeringdb.com/net/4224\">physical facilities</a></li><li>In any of the 23 metro areas where we are currently connected to an Interconnection Platform (see below)</li><li>If you’d like to connect virtually in a location not yet listed below, simply <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com/network-interconnect-partner-program\">get in touch</a> via our interconnection page and we’ll work out the best way to connect.</li></ol><h3 id=\"metro-areas\">Metro Areas</h3><p>The metro areas below have currently active connections.
