	<p>CloudFlare uses Go extensively to build our service and we need to people to build and maintain those systems. We've written a complete <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/what-weve-been-doing-with-go">DNS server</a> in Go, our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/go-at-cloudflare">Railgun</a> service is all Go and we're moving more and more systems to Go programs.</p>
	<p>We've recently written about our open source <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/red-october-cloudflares-open-source-implementation-of-the-two-man-rule">Red October</a> Go project for securing secrets, and open-sourced our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cfssl">CFSSL</a> Go-based PKI package. Go is now making its way into our data pipeline and be used for processing huge amounts of data.</p>
	<p>We even have a <a href="http://cloudflare.github.io/#cat-Go">Go-specific section</a> on our GitHub.</p>
	<p>If you're interested in working in Go on a high-performance global network like CloudFlare, send us an <a href="mailto:careers@cloudflare.com">email</a>.</p>
