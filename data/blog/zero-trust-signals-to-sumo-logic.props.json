As a Cloudflare <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/sumo-logic/\">technology partner</a>, Sumo Logic is the pioneer in continuous intelligence, a new category of software which enables organizations of all sizes to address the data challenges and opportunities presented by digital transformation, modern applications, and cloud computing. </p><p>The updated content in Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM helps joint Cloudflare customers reduce alert fatigue tied to Zero Trust logs and accelerates the triage process for security analysts by converging security and network data into high-fidelity insights.

These logs are helpful and important because they provide the who, what, when, and where for activity happening within and across an organization. They contain <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-siem/\">information</a> such as what website was accessed, who signed in to an application, or what data may have been shared from a SaaS service.</p><p>Up until now, our integrations with Sumo Logic only allowed automated correlation of security signals for Cloudflare only included core services. While it’s critical to ensure collection of <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/\">WAF</a> and bot detection events across your fabric, extended visibility into <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/\">Zero Trust components</a> has now become more important than ever with the explosion of distributed work and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure architectures.</p><p>With the expanded Zero Trust logs now available in Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM, customers can now get deeper context into security insights thanks to the broad set of network and security logs produced by Cloudflare products:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/\">Cloudflare Gateway</a> (Network, DNS, HTTP)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/browser-isolation/\">Cloudflare Remote Browser Isolation</a> (included with Gateway logs)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/dlp/\">Cloudflare Data Loss Prevention</a> (included with Gateway logs)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/\">Cloudflare Access</a> (Access audit logs)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/casb/\">Cloudflare Cloud Access Security Broker</a> (Findings logs)<br></li></ul><blockquote>“As a long time Cloudflare partner, we’ve worked together to help joint customers analyze events and trends from their websites and applications to provide end-to-end visibility and improve digital experiences. We’re excited to expand this partnership to provide real-time insights into the Zero Trust security posture of mutual customers in Sumo Logic’s Cloud SIEM.” <br>- <strong>John Coyle</strong> - Vice President of Business Development, Sumo Logic</blockquote><h3 id=\"how-to-get-started\">How to get started</h3><p>To take advantage of the suite of integrations available for Sumo Logic and Cloudflare logs available via Logpush, first enable Logpush to Sumo Logic, which will ship logs directly to Sumo Logic’s cloud-native platform. Then, install the Cloudflare App and (for Cloud SIEM customers) enable forwarding of these logs to Cloud SIEM for automated normalization and correlation of security insights. </p><p>Note that Cloudflare’s Logpush service is only available to Enterprise customers.
