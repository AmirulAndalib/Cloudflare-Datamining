Today, we’re excited to make it even easier for you to get connected with the Magic WAN Connector: a lightweight software package you can install in any physical or cloud network to automatically connect, steer, and shape any IP traffic.</p><p>You can install the Magic WAN Connector on physical or virtual hardware you already have, or purchase it pre-installed on a Cloudflare-certified device. It ensures the best possible connectivity to the closest Cloudflare network location, where we’ll apply security controls and send traffic on an optimized route to its destination. Embracing <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/\">SASE</a> has never been simpler.</p><h3 id=\"solving-today-s-problems-and-setting-up-for-tomorrow\">Solving today’s problems and setting up for tomorrow</h3><p>Over the past few years, we’ve had the opportunity to learn from IT teams about how their corporate networks have evolved and the challenges they’re facing today. Most organizations describe a starting point of private connectivity and “castle and moat” security controls: a corporate <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-wan/\">WAN</a> composed of point-to-point and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mpls/\">MPLS</a> circuits and hardware appliances at the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-the-network-perimeter/\">perimeter of physical networks</a>. This architecture model worked well in a pre-cloud world, but as applications have shifted outside of the walls of the corporate data center and users can increasingly work from anywhere, the concept of the perimeter has crumbled.</p><p>In response to these shifts, traditional networking and security vendors have developed a wide array of point solutions to fill specific gaps: a virtual appliance to filter web traffic, a physical one to optimize bandwidth use across multiple circuits, a cloud-based tool to prevent data loss, and so on. IT teams now need to manage a broader-than-ever set of tools and contend with gaps in security, visibility, and control as a result.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/01/image3-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Today’s fragmented corporate network\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Today’s fragmented corporate network</em></figcaption></figure><p>We view this current state, with IT teams contending with a patchwork of tools and a never-ending ticket queue, as a transitional period to a world where the Internet forms the foundation of the corporate network. Cloudflare One is enabling organizations of all sizes to make the transition to SASE: connecting any traffic source and destination to a secure, fast, reliable global network where all security functions are enforced and traffic is optimized on the way to its destination, whether that’s within a private network or on the public Internet.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/01/image1-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Secure Access Service Edge architecture\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Secure Access Service Edge architecture</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"magic-wan-connector-the-easiest-way-to-connect-your-network-to-cloudflare\">Magic WAN Connector: the easiest way to connect your network to Cloudflare</h3><p>The first step to adopting SASE is getting connected – establishing a secure path from your existing network to the closest location where Zero Trust security policies can be applied. Cloudflare offers a broad set of “on-ramps” to enable this connectivity, including client-based and clientless access options for roaming users, application-layer tunnels established by deploying a lightweight software daemon, network-layer connectivity with standard GRE or IPsec tunnels, and physical or virtual interconnection.</p><p>Today, to make this first step to SASE even easier, we’re introducing a new member to this family of on-ramps. The Magic WAN Connector can be deployed in any physical or cloud network to provide automatic connectivity to the closest Cloudflare network location, leveraging your existing last mile Internet connectivity and removing the requirement for IT teams to manually configure network gear to get connected.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/01/image2-10.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Magic WAN Connector provides easy connectivity to Cloudflare’s network\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Magic WAN Connector provides easy connectivity to Cloudflare’s network</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"end-to-end-traffic-management\">End-to-end traffic management</h3><p>Hundreds of customer conversations over the past few years have helped us define a slim set of functionality that customers need within their on-premise and cloud networks. They’ve described this as “light branch, heavy cloud” architecture – minimizing the footprint at corporate network locations and shifting the majority of functions that used to be deployed in on-premise hardware to a globally distributed network.</p><p>The Magic WAN Connector includes a critical feature set to make the best possible use of available last mile connectivity. This includes traffic routing, load balancing, and failover; application-aware traffic steering and shaping; and automatic configuration and orchestration. These capabilities connect you automatically to the closest Cloudflare location, where traffic is optimized and routed to its destination. This approach allows you to use Cloudflare’s network – presence in 275 cities and 100 countries across the globe, 11,000+ interconnects and a growing fiber backbone – as an extension of your own.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table width=\"100%\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Network function</th>\n    <th>Magic WAN Connector</th>\n    <th>Cloudflare Network</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Branch routing (traffic shaping, failover, QoS)</td>\n    <td>Application-aware routing and traffic steering between multiple last mile Internet circuits</td>\n    <td>Application-aware routing and traffic steering across the middle mile to get traffic to its destination</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Centralized device management</td>\n    <td>Connector config controlled from unified Cloudflare dashboard</td>\n    <td>Cloudflare unified dashboard portal, observability, Zero Trust services</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Zero-touch configuration</td>\n    <td>Automagic config; boots with smart defaults and sets up tunnels + routes</td>\n    <td>Automagic config; Magic WAN Connector pulls down updates from central control plane</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>VPN + Firewall</td>\n    <td>VPN termination + basic network segmentation included</td>\n    <td>Full-featured SASE platform including ZTNA, FWaaS, DDoS, WAAP, and Email Security</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Application-aware path selection</td>\n    <td>Application-aware traffic shaping for last mile</td>\n    <td>Application-aware Enhanced Internet for middle mile</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Application auto discovery</td>\n    <td>Works with Cloudflare network to perform application discovery and classification in real time</td>\n    <td>1+1=3: Cloudflare Zero Trust application classification tools reused in this context</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Application performance visibility</td>\n    <td>Acts as telemetry source for Cloudflare observability tools</td>\n    <td>Cloudflare One Analytics platform &amp; Digital Experience Monitoring</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Software can be deployed in the cloud</td>\n    <td>Software can be deployed as a public cloud VM</td>\n    <td>All configuration controlled via unified Cloudflare dashboard</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"fully-integrated-security-from-day-0\">Fully integrated security from day 0</h3><p>The Magic WAN Connector, like all of Cloudflare’s products, was developed from the ground up to natively integrate with the rest of the Cloudflare One portfolio.
