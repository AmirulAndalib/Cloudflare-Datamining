This blog aims to answer that question.</p><p>Before, during, and after the game a crack team of three people who work on <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/superbowl-lv\">Cloudflare Radar</a> looked at real time statistics for traffic to advertisers’ websites, social media in the US, US food delivery services, and websites covering (American) football. Luckily, one of us (Kari) is (a) American and (b) a fan of football. Unluckily, one of us (Kari) is a fan of the <a href=\"https://www.chiefs.com/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>.</p><p>Cloudflare Radar uses a variety of sources to provide aggregate information about Internet traffic and attack trends. In this blog post we use DNS name resolution data to estimate traffic to websites. We can’t see who visited the websites mentioned below, or what anyone did on the websites, but DNS can give us an estimate of the interest generated by the commercials. This analysis only looked at the top-level names in each domain (so example.com and <a href=\"http://www.example.com\">www.example.com</a> and not any other subdomains).</p><h3>The Big Picture</h3><p>To get the ball rolling here’s a look at traffic to NFL team websites and sports websites. Traffic builds to a peak as the game begins just after 1830 local time. As the game progresses traffic to those websites drops off hitting a mid-game low at about 2015 before jumping up for 30 minutes during the halftime show.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1sG2yFhc0A6WtBNc6wQt2z/bd3aba83505102cb814e1a76efbd9847/image2-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>The big peak at around 2145 appears to be at the same time as a streaker ran onto the field. A lesser peak comes soon after 2200 when the Buccaneers sealed their victory.</p><p>As well as reading about the game, fans were also using social media to get news and add their own commentary. Here’s a look at US social media use during the game.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7AWGVmXKhrWqnTKHc8wpSb/ae160ba2205a1ab5f511c15d5d77a75a/image10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Social media use dips a little just as the game is about to begin and then ramps up until the Buccaneers’ victory is final. And then, as people go to sleep, social media use falls away.</p><p>Taking a look at food delivery services it looks like folks orders ramped up about 90 minutes before the game started and people’s hunger was sated before the game ended.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7GXNozadZmBtuSMRejxfvI/92cdc81e5013b8f8659a741a68da19f7/general-food-delivery.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>The Internet Impact of Commercials</h3><p>One question is “Does a Super Bowl commercial drive traffic to the company’s web site while the game is on?” Answer: yes. Here’s one that went vroom peaking at over 40x baseline:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3hVAKy6ycsRpcPX4f9IDxb/1afd570fdf979a3e537c2e2a3435e17c/image7-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Vehicles and related services played a big part. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdsPvbSpB2Y\">GM</a> tried to take on Norway with a commercial about their electric vehicle batteries.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2fBACGBLOpLTSx1WruPK8L/06e01f4b2f877405038706b15b83960e/image3-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>And the electric vehicle theme continued with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KAlqthD6Gc\">Cadillac</a>:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/31AtcEgyBIBfJ72fKvQ10f/9dc06f269da5303979628dca1427e320/image23.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2XYH-IEvhI\">Jeep</a>’s commercial caused a similar spike:</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1ke7alCtaTAjMMug1jJfQ0/1b77720b9d6abc03ebe7a74feee9801c/image16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><h3>Food and Drink</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDvNUJUVmGk\">Anheuser-Busch</a> had a “corporate” commercial this time (as opposed to a commercial for their individual brands). You can clearly see from this chart when that aired.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3hgxHA9p8zXVWzcGl5y79a/e618109cd760604333384e3463e87c19/image24.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>And Bud Light got a boost that seemed to keep people thinking about beer through the game.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4y1vLbJPyZ31LodvMzyQSY/0fa23d6f7bcd12ff6cdf98274e87aea7/image13.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Some brands see a spike when the commercial airs and then traffic reverts fairly quickly towards the baseline. Another brand that lingered on post-commercial is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjMalUSxBvs\">Mountain Dew</a>. Prior to the commercial, traffic to the Mountain Dew website was steady, then came the airing of the commercial with a greater than 25x peak followed by interest throughout the game and into the night.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1lU9yVUPqTt6U7bdx8B4ei/afb8cccad02dac980b2d367136518a7a/image20.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Pepsi sponsored the halftime show and that’s clearly visible in the charts as they get a boost through <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rhadTURsrw\">The Weeknd’s performance</a>.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1Npe0SWJ79h6aQv015Xr7u/db5a21e66a204e49d3ecf64db3f9f9bc/image9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Moving on from drinks and reaching for the snacks we can see that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLuqtTn4610\">Doritos</a> were pretty popular all evening long with visible commercial induced spikes.</p>\n            <figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card \">\n            \n            <Image src=\"https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3nMQIycajtMmAO0QIoRMMN/78f408d495b63a69cbce471f27cc8eae/image14.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" width=\"1339\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n            \n            </figure><p>Brands that might not be so well known get a large traffic boost from their Super Bowl commercials.
