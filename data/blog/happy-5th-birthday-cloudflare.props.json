Two years ago we enabled on our <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/\" target=\"_blank\">Automatic IPv6 Gateway</a>, allowing our users to support IPv6 without having to update their own servers. Last year we made <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/\" target=\"_blank\">Universal SSL support</a> available to all our customers, even those on our free plan. And this year, we announced the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-extended-cloudflares-performance-and-security-into-mainland-china/\" target=\"_blank\">expansion across Mainland China</a>, building the first truly global performance and security platform.</p>\n<h3 id=\"internetsummitparty\">Internet Summit &amp; Party</h3>\n<p>We celebrated in San Francisco last week with CloudFlare's first Internet Summit at our new San Francisco Headquarters with more than 500 of our customers and friends. Speakers discussed their visions for the challenges and opportunities for the Internet over the next five years. We'll be posting videos of those talks over the course of this week. In the meantime, here are some photographs from the Summit and the party later that night with one of our favorite bands, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WalkOffTheEarth\" target=\"_blank\">Walk Off the Earth</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/09/matthew_michelle_summit.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew &amp; Michelle at the CloudFlare Internet Summit\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/09/summit_president_estonia.jpg\" alt=\"President of Estonia at the CloudFlare Internet Summit\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/09/cloudflare_baloons.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare Party Balloons\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/09/party_roof_deck.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare Party Roof Deck\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/09/WOTE.jpg\" alt=\"CloudFlare Party Walk Off the Earth\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2015/09/confetti_cannon.JPG\" alt=\"CloudFlare Party Confetti Cannon\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Thanks everyone for your support over the last five years.
