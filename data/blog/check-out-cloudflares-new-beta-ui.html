	<p>CloudFlare has been beta testing a new account interface for several months with many of our followers on Facebook and Twitter. This week, we rolled out the new interface to all CloudFlare users. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I'm going to cover many of the key changes in a visual walkthrough.</p>
	<p>Note: The CloudFlare 'DNS Settings' page has also undergone some changes. Since the changes to that page are worthy of a separate post, I'll do an additional post about DNS settings in the near future.</p>
	<h3>Add multiple sites at once</h3>
	<p>Site owners can now add multiple domains at once. To add multiple websites, list them in the My websites input field separated by commas.</p>

	<h3>Easier Navigation to CloudFlare Reporting and Threat Control</h3>
	<p>We've made it easier to find the most popular pages, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>'Dashboards' has been replaced with 'Analytics' and 'Threat Control' to save users from having to do an additional click to get to the CloudFlare Reporting and Threat Control Dashboards.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Development Mode, one of our most widely used features, can now be turned on directly from they My Websites pag, by choosing the gear icon</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>'Deactivate' has been renamed 'Pause CloudFlare'. We hope the new terminology helps customers understand how to temporarily pause CloudFlare in the event of an issue.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Improved Pages for Settings</h3>
	<p>The new 'Settings' page makes it easier to find the setting you're looking for by classifying them with different tabs.</p>
