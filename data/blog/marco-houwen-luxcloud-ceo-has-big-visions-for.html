	<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/LuxCloud" target="_blank">Marco</a>, together with his partners LuxConnect and Datacenter Luxembourg, founded <a href="http://luxcloud.com/" target="_blank">LuxCloud S.A.</a> in April 2010. He has strong expertise in co-location, hosting, load-balancing, managing of e-commerce platforms and all associated managed services.</p>
	<p>There are a lot of exciting things happening at LuxCloud and we were lucky enough to get an opportunity to hear about them from Marco himself.</p>
	<p>LuxCloud is a market leading provider of cloud computing services, allowing companies to quickly launch and profitably deliver the cloud services demanded by small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
	<p>"We are positioning ourselves between the software and the channel," said Marco. "We are taking out the difficult part which is automation of the whole sales process."</p>
	<p>LuxCloud is also ramping up to expand internationally and bring on twice as many employees as they have today.</p>
	<p>"Right now we are setting up operations in the U.S. and Singapore, hopefully we will be going into South America by 2013," said Marco.</p>
	<p>When asked about his time at HostingCon this year, Marco had big thoughts on what he was seeing in the cloud computing industry.</p>
	<p>"We have to become aware that we are driving the world. The whole economy of the world with the cloud and SaaS services. That's a huge responsiblity that I see a lot of people taking on. It's thrilling."</p>
	<p><em>At HostingCon 2012, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a> co-founder <a href="https://www.twitter.com/zatlyn" target="_blank"> Michelle Zatlyn</a> sat down with 28 leading experts in the hosting industry. Their conversations were captured live and offer insight into the latest trends and news in hosting.</em></p>
