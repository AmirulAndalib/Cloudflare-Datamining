An Internet outage in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-gambia-without-internet/\">The Gambia</a> because of a cable problem.<br>2. An Internet shutdown in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-shut-down-in-kazakhstan-amid-unrest/\">Kazakhstan</a> because of unrest.<br>3.

An Internet outage in <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/to\">Tonga</a> because of a volcanic eruption.</p><p>The latest Internet outage, in the South Pacific country of Tonga (with 169 islands), is still ongoing. It started with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Hunga_Tonga_eruption_and_tsunami\">large eruption</a> of Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai, an uninhabited volcanic island of the Tongan archipelago on Friday, January 14, 2022. The next day, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/to\">Cloudflare Radar</a> shows that the Internet outage started at around 03:00 UTC (16:00 local time) — Saturday, January 15, 2022 — and is ongoing for more than four days. Tonga’s 105,000 residents are almost entirely unreachable, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60021759\">BBC</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image4-14.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>When we focus on the number of requests by <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\">ASN</a>, the country’s main ISPs Digicel and Kalianet started to lose traffic after 03:00 UTC and by 05:30 UTC January 15, 2022, Cloudflare saw close to no traffic at all from them, as shown in the graph below.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image2-21.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Looking at the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\">BGP</a> (Border Gateway Protocol) updates from Tonga’s ASNs around the time of the outage, we see a clear spike at 05:35 UTC (18:35 local time). These update messages are BGP signalling that the Tongan ASNs are no longer routable. We saw the same trend in <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-gambia-without-internet/\">The Gambia outage</a> of January 4, 2022 — there you can read about the importance of BGP as a mechanism to exchange routing information between autonomous systems on the Internet, something that was also seen in the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/\">2021 Facebook outage</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/01/image7-11.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"BGP updates from Tongan ASNs around the time of the outage.\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\">BGP</a> updates from Tongan ASNs around the time of the outage.</figcaption></figure><p>Cloudflare Radar data doesn’t show any significant disruptions for Internet traffic in Tonga’s neighbours <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/as\">American Samoa</a> (although there was a small decrease in traffic on Friday and Saturday, January 14 and 15, 2022 in comparison with the previous week) and <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/fj\">Fiji</a>.

That is something that was improved five years ago with an infrastructure connectivity program from the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2019/09/16/closing-the-digital-divide-in-tonga\">World Bank</a>. Prior to that, the country was dependent on satellite links for Internet that included a very <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/44172/44172-022-pcr-en.pdf\">small percentage of the population</a>.</p><h3 id=\"repairs-could-take-a-few-weeks\">Repairs could take a few weeks</h3><p>Southern Cross Cable Network <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/127512800/tonga-subsea-communications-cable-may-be-broken-after-all-says-southern-cross\">confirmed</a> that the 827 km fiber-optic undersea communications cable connecting Tonga to the outside world may have been broken. The company is assisting Tonga Cable Limited (TCL), which owns the single cable that provides Internet access and almost all communications to and from the archipelago.</p><p>The eruption resulted <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/volcanic-eruption-takes-out-tonga-cables/\">in a fault</a> in the international cable 37 kilometres from Nukuʻalofa (Tonga’s capital), and a further fault in a domestic cable 47 km from the capital.</p><p>TCL <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/127517682/cable-repair-ship-to-set-sail-from-png-to-restore-communications-to-tonga?rm=a\">announced that it has already met </a>with the US cable company SubCom to start preparations for SubCom’s cable repair ship <a href=\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:711444/mmsi:538001583/imo:9236494/vessel:RELIANCE\">Reliance</a> to be dispatched from Papua New Guinea to Tonga, possibly via Samoa (more than 4,000 km away).</p><p>The repairs could take \"at least\" <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60021759\">four weeks</a>, given that a repair to a fiber-optic cable that has been cut on the seabed is considered more complicated than misconfigurations, power outages or other types of infrastructure damage. “The site conditions in Tonga have to be assessed thoroughly because of volcanic activities,” <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/127517682/cable-repair-ship-to-set-sail-from-png-to-restore-communications-to-tonga?rm=a\">according</a> to TCL chairman Samiuela Fonua.</p><p>Fonua also mentioned that the last cable cut (back in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46968752\">2019</a>) took nearly two weeks to repair, but this time the site conditions will determine the time it will take — the two cables are not far away from the eruption site (the volcano is still active). According to <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/kacific-waiting-for-tongan-contract-activation-to-supply-satellite-services-post-eruption/\">ZDNet</a>, in 2019 Tonga signed a <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/tonga-signs-15-year-satellite-deal-after-january-cable-outage/\">15-year</a> deal with Kacific for satellite connectivity, but since then the satellite provider says it is waiting on the Tongan government to activate its contract.</p><h3 id=\"svalbard-undersea-cable-system-also-disrupted-in-january\">Svalbard Undersea Cable System also disrupted in January</h3><p>Also in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philBE2/status/1480227313606402054\">January</a>, Space Norway, the operator of the world’s most northern submarine cable — the Svalbard Undersea Cable System — <a href=\"https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2022/01/disruption-one-two-undersea-optical-cables-svalbard\">announced</a> that on January 7 it located a disruption in one of the two twin submarine fiber optic communication cables connecting Longyearbyen with Andøya north of Harstad in northern Norway (in the area where the seabed goes from 300 meters down to 2,700 meters in the Greenland Sea). A <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/space-norway-plots-recovery-mission-for-failed-subsea-cable/\">repair mission</a> is being planned.</p><h3 id=\"a-world-of-undersea-cables-for-the-world-s-communications\">A world of undersea cables for the world’s communications</h3><p>A significant amount of Internet traffic is carried by a complex network of undersea fiber-optic cables that connect countries and continents.
