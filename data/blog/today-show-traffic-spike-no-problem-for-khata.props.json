The TODAY Show is the top morning TV show in America, with more than 5 million viewers each day.</p>\n<p>So, when the management team at <a href=\"http://www.khataland.com/\">Khataland.com</a> got the call that Jill Martin was going to feature one of their products in the Steals &amp; Deals promotion on Tuesday, January 24, they were excited. And then they got to work.<a href=\"http://www.khataland.com/\"></a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.khataland.com/\"></a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.khataland.com/\"><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/khataland-home-page.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"><noscript><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For\nKhataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/khataland-home-page.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"></noscript></a></p>\n<p>NBC editors tell featured companies to expect up to 100,000 hits in the span of a few minutes after the TV segment airs, with follow-on spikes as the show airs in each successive time zone. So the team at Khataland got in touch with <a href=\"http://www.corecommerce.com/\">CoreCommerce</a>, who runs their online store, and made some plans to handle the expected surge.</p>\n<p>Those plans quickly involved CloudFlare.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workingtogether\">Working Together</h3>\n<p>CloudFlare works in cooperation with any webserver or platform to make sure websites are safe, fast, and available. There's no relationship required between CloudFlare and your host, but it doesn't hurt that CloudFlare and CoreCommerce serve several customers together. For instance, earlier this month, <a href=\"http://benderbound.com/\">Benderbound</a> enjoyed the combination to make sure their site was fast and available during a smaller TODAY Show appearance.</p>\n<p>So, when Khataland asked CoreCommerce for help, they recommended CloudFlare.</p>\n<p>Here's how Brandon Wanamaker, from the quality assurance team, put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\nWe always do our best to provide top-tier service to our customers at the product and customer experience levels. CloudFlare allows us to\nmultiply our efforts to speed up the software; reduces the merchant&apos;s\nexpense by absorbing a very large majority of bandwidth usage; and\nprotects higher profile, or otherwise unfortunate, targets of a denial\nof service attack and other malicious traffic. The more merchants on\nour system using CloudFlare, the faster and safer the CoreCommerce\nsystem is. Shoppers are less likely to abandon their shopping carts on\na faster site. Merchants avoid huge bandwidth usage and possibly\noverages. Finally, it makes our lives a little easier when the system\nis running smoothly. It&apos;s changed how we handle stores featured on a\nnational TV broadcast, with potential surge in traffic. We insist on\nCloudFlare to keep their stores and CoreCommerce running quickly, with\nno hiccups. With such huge exposure, downtime is not an option, and in\nevery case, CloudFlare has never failed. And the setup is way too\nsimple for something that does so much. Registration, a few clicks and\nyou&apos;re done! I can&apos;t say enough good things about the experience the CoreCommerce team and our merchants have had working with CloudFlare.\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"quicksetupfantasticresults\">Quick Setup, Fantastic Results</h3>\n<p>The team at Khataland signed up for CloudFlare directly, changed their nameservers, and ordered CloudFlare Pro to secure transactions with Full SSL. Everything was in place in under an hour, letting the Khataland and CoreCommerce team focus on other preparations for making a whole bunch of brand-new customers happy.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/hip2save-khataland.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"><noscript><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/hip2save-khataland.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"></noscript></p>\n<p>Here's what Khataland shared:</p>\n<blockquote>\nWe had huge interest from Today Show viewers. In the first hour after\nthe show, we had more than 60,000 views and sold more than half of our\nspecial packages for the show. Our website remained up and functioning\nduring this huge spike.\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the spike for yourself, starting in the largest viewership (Eastern Time) with each time zone providing another bump an hour later.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/khataland-today-show-traffic.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"><noscript><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/khataland-today-show-traffic.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"></noscript></p>\n<p>Brandon on the CoreCommerce team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bdub_thetester/status/161886863450312704\">tweeted</a> about the resources saved.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/tweet-about-khataland.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"><noscript><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/tweet-about-khataland.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"></noscript></p>\n<p>Here's a more graphical view from the CloudFlare dashboard, showing the<br>\nsavings.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/khataland-requests-bandwidth-saved.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"><noscript><img alt=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\" src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/khataland-requests-bandwidth-saved.png.scaled500.png\" title=\"TODAY Show Traffic Spike No Problem For Khataland\"></noscript></p>\n<h3 id=\"makethemostofyourtimeinthespotlight\">Make The Most Of Your Time In The Spotlight</h3>\n<p>Surges in traffic come for many reasons beyond TV promotion, from the <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tales-from-the-pumpkin-patch\">Halloween holiday</a>, a <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/an-american-story-surviving-the-crush-of-holi\">pre-Christmas sale</a>, or simply <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-saves-groundhog-day\">Groundhog Day</a> (next week!). CloudFlare's ability to deliver information quickly to your visitors without overloading your webserver becomes dramatically important during these surges.</p>\n<p>But a fast, always available, secure website is important every day, so <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/sign-up\">sign up for CloudFlare</a> now.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->",
