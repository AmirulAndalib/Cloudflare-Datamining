	<p>Due to the nature of the Anycast network, we have over 200 Points of Presence (PoPs) that manage failover traffic. Traffic would simply be rerouted to other locations. Learn about the Anycast network here: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/?ref=blog.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">https://www.cloudflare.com/network/</a>.</p>
	<p>The Infrastructure and Engineering teams are working proactively to ensure that enough capacity is available at our most critical PoPs. We feel confident in our ability to service our most critical facilities with our approved partner.</p>
