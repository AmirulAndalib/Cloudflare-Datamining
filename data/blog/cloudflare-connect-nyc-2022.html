	<p>We take a break from <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/platform-week">Platform Week</a> to share big news â€“ weâ€™re going to New York this week for our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/connect2022">Cloudflare Connect</a> customer event. </p>
	<p>Weâ€™re packing our bags, getting on planes and heading to New York to do our first live customer event since 2019 and we could not be more excited. Â&nbsp;It is time with you â€“ the people building, delivering and securing the apps and networks we know and trust â€“ that are the inspiration for the innovation we deliver. Â&nbsp;We canâ€™t wait to spend time with you.</p>
	<p>Our co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince will kick off the day with his view from the top. Â&nbsp;Weâ€™ll then be breaking out into focused conversations to dig in on our latest product news and roadmaps.</p>
	<p>Excited about what weâ€™re talking about for Platform Week? Â&nbsp;Come chat with the Workers team in person and hear more about the roadmap.</p>
	<p>Intrigued by the latest DDoS stats we posted and want to learn more? Â&nbsp;Meet with the team analyzing the attacks and learn about where we go from here.</p>
	<p>Not sure where to start your <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> journey? Â&nbsp;Weâ€™ll talk you through what weâ€™re seeing and introduce you to other customers who are in the process of rolling out Zero Trust solutions for their teams so you can learn from each other.</p>
