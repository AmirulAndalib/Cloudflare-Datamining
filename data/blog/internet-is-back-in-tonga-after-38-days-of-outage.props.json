Tonga has a population of around 105,000, 70% of whom reside on the main island, Tongatapu and around 5% (5,000) live on the nearby island of Eua (now also connected to the Internet).</p><p>Telecommunication companies in neighboring Pacific islands, particularly New Caledonia, provided lengths of cable when Tonga ran out, said Panuve.</p><h3 id=\"a-world-of-undersea-cables-for-the-world-s-communications\">A world of undersea cables for the world’s communications</h3><p>We have mentioned before, for example in our first <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/tonga-internet-outage/\">blog post</a> about the Tonga outage, how undersea cables are important to global Internet traffic that is mostly carried by a complex network that connects countries and continents.</p><p>The full <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable\">submarine cable system</a> (the first communications cables laid were from the 1850s and carried telegraphy traffic) is what makes most of the world’s Internet function between countries and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_submarine_communications_cables\">continents</a>. There are <a href=\"https://submarine-cable-map-2021.telegeography.com/\">428 active submarine cables</a> (36 are planned), running to an estimated 1.3 million km around the globe.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/02/Untitled.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>World map of submarine cables. Antarctica is the only continent not yet reached by a submarine telecommunications cable.

That wasn't the case for the Tonga outage, given that the 827 km submarine cable only connects Fiji to the Tonga archipelago — Fiji is connected to the main Southern Cross Cable, as the next image illustrates.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/02/pasted-image-0--3-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.submarinecablemap.com/\">Submarine Cable Map</a> shows the undersea cables that connect Australia to Fiji and the following connections to other archipelagos like Tonga.
