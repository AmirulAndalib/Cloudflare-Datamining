<h2 id="h_191285021171541026059228">Common causes and resolutions</h2>
<p>Below are the most common causes for DNS resolution errors along with suggested solutions.</p>
<h3>Mistyped domain or subdomain</h3>
<p>Verify that the domain or subdomain was correctly spelled in the request URL.</p>
<h3>Missing DNS records</h3>
<p>Ensure that you have the necessary DNS records in the <b>DNS</b> app of your Cloudflare dashboard. This includes having the following records:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The root domain (e.g., <i>example.com</i>)</li>
	<li>Any existing subdomains (e.g., <i>www.example.com, blog.example.com</i>, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>DNSSEC wasn't disabled before the domain was added to Cloudflare</h3>
<p>DNS resolution failures occur if <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/205359838#h_94453043811540417238269">DNSSEC is not disabled</a> at your domain provider before you add the domain to Cloudflare.</p>
<h3>Nameservers no longer point to Cloudflare</h3>
<p>If you manage DNS records via the <b>DNS</b> app in Cloudflare's Dashboard and your domain stops pointing to Cloudflare's nameservers, DNS resolution will break.  This can occur if your domain registrar switches the nameservers for your domain to point to their default nameservers. To confirm if this is the problem, <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/4426809598605">check whether your domain uses Cloudflare's nameservers</a>.</p>
<h3>Unresolved IP address</h3>
<p>In rare cases, the DNS resolver in the client requesting the URL might fail to resolve a DNS record to a valid IP address.  Reload the page after a short wait to see if the problem disappears. This issue is unrelated to Cloudflare, but using <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setting-up-1.1.1.1/">Cloudflare's DNS resolver</a> may help. Contact your hosting provider for additional help with your current DNS resolver.</p>
