<h3>Why do I not see scripts after I activated Page Shield?</h3>
<p>If you recently activated Page Shield, you may see a delay in reporting.Â </p>
<p>Cloudflare creates reports based on a sample of your application traffic. These reports need a certain amount of traffic to be statistically valid.</p>
<h3>Why do I see scripts that I do not recognize?</h3>
<p>Scripts often reference other scripts outside your application.</p>
<p>But, if you see unexpected scripts on your Script Monitor dashboard, check them for signs of malicious activity.</p>
<h3>Why do I see warnings in my browser's developer tools related to Content Security Policy (CSP)?</h3>
<p>Page Shield uses a Content Security Policy (CSP) report-only directive to gather a list of all scripts running on your application.</p>
<p>Some browsers display scripts being reported as warnings in the console pane of their developer tools. For example:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>[Report Only] Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'none'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-RFWPLDbv2BY+rCkDzsE+0fr8ylGr2R2faWMhq4lfEQc='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.</pre>
<p>You can safely ignore these warnings, since they are related to the reports that Page Shield requires to detect loaded scripts. For more information, refer to <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/about">Page Shield's developer documentation</a>.</p>
