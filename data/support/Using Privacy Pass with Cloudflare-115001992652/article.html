<p><i>Understand how Privacy Pass helps decrease a visitor's frequency of CAPTCHA and how to enable it while using Cloudflare.</i></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="AInhz96f0G3ReDyxA9WaO">Overview</h2>
<p>Privacy Pass is a Chrome and Firefox browser extension that provides a better visitor experience for Cloudflare-protected websites.  For instance, a visitor IP address with poor reputation may receive a Cloudflare CAPTCHA page before gaining access to a Cloudflare-protected website.  After a single CAPTCHA page is solved, Privacy Pass generates tokens for use with Cloudflare websites to prevent frequent CAPTCHA.  Privacy Pass generates 30 tokens for each solved CAPTCHA.</p>
<p>Privacy Pass allows a user to bypass CAPTCHAs. To help mitigate malicious usage of this, we automatically disable Privacy Pass anytime a domain is placed into "<a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170076-Understanding-Cloudflare-Under-Attack-mode-advanced-DDOS-protection-">I'm Under Attack!</a>" mode. A few key points you need to keep in mind when enabling the "I'm Under Attack!" mode:</p>
<ol>
	<li>When "I'm Under Attack!" mode is enabled on a domain, then Privacy Pass is disabled.</li>
	<li>When "I'm Under Attack!" mode is disabled on a domain, then Privacy Pass is re-enabled if it was enabled before "I'm Under Attack!" mode was turned on. </li>
	<li>If Privacy Pass was disabled before "I'm Under Attack!" mode is turned on, it does not get enabled when "I'm Under Attack!" mode is turned off. </li>
	<li>Privacy Pass cannot be enabled while "I'm Under Attack!" mode is turned on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Privacy Pass is helpful for visitors from shared networks, VPNs and Tor that tend to have poorer IP reputations.  Enable <b>Privacy Pass Support</b> in <b>Security</b> &gt; <b>Settings</b>.  Download the Privacy Pass extension for either Google Chrome or Firefox:</p>
