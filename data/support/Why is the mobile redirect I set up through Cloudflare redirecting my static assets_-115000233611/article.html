<p>Cloudflare's mobile redirect will redirect all traffic from your root domain e.g. example.com and www.example.com to m.eaxmple.com. This includes all the resources under the domain.</p>
<p>To host this static content under the mobile subdomain (m.example.com), our recommendation would be to put a file link or similar on your server so that images and other content can be served.</p>
