<h2 id="h_6v9PrAUcuaN7j47oyeOPgw">Step 4: Mitigate DDoS Ransom Campaigns</h2>
<p>It is common for ransomers to threaten DDoS attacks, even when a customer is using Cloudflare. Here are some troubleshooting tips if you are targeted by ransomers to ensure your origin server is prepared to handle excess requests.</p>
<h3>Mitigating DDoS Ransom Campaigns</h3>
<p>It is very common for ransom attempts to instill a sense of urgency. Any delay decreases the chance of success for the attacker as it gives the target time to consider mitigation options. The most important thing to keep in mind is that if you suspect your site is being targeted for a ransom, <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200172476-Contacting-Cloudflare-Support">contact Cloudflare support</a> first. <b>Do not</b> pay the ransom.</p>
<p>The following table lists mitigation options for DDoS ransom campaigns:</p>
<p></p>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Action</th>
			<th>Justification</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
				<p>Don't Pay</p>
			</td>
			<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
				<p>It's best not to pay the ransom. If paid, the ransomer knows they have found a valuable target and may periodically return to collect another payment. Ransomers tend to introduce themselves as a security researchers who have found a vulnerability. This will, understandably, increase the response rate of website owners, as it is not immediately clear that they are about to be ransomed. If at all possible, don’tone should not respond to the ransom at all, and instead <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200172476-Contacting-Cloudflare-Support">contact Cloudflare support.</a></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
				<p>Disable <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115001992652-Using-Privacy-Pass-with-Cloudflare">Privacy Pass Support</a></p>
			</td>
			<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
				<p>In several reports, attackers claim to exploit Privacy Pass. This is not so much a vulnerability in Privacy Pass, but a side effect of how Privacy Pass interacts with other Cloudflare features.

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
				<p>Enable <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200170076">I'm Under Attack Mode (IUAM)</a>!</p>
			</td>
			<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
				<p>IUAM is designed to help mitigate attacks and generally increase a zone's security, so it's a good idea during several types of attacks.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
				<p>Enable <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115001635128-Configuring-Cloudflare-Rate-Limiting">Rate Limiting</a></p>
			</td>
			<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
				<p>Some DDoS attacks are effective at low rates because the attacker targets an endpoint which they have discovered to be uncachable and computationally expensive for the origin server. If an origin server normally receives a dozen or so logins each second and suddenly sees thousands per second, this can result in degraded performance and will likely result in an increased bill for cloud service. Rate Limiting works well against simple single-origin DoS, small botnets, and it may prevent the attacks from persisting for a long period of time . It can also help drop floods to the origin, but its efficacy may be limited for very weak origin servers.
