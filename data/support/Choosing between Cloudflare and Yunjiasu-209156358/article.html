<h2 id="6yDXkEW9ZoI7rzKAyyDCXu">Overview</h2>
<p>There are many benefits to both services in Cloudflare’s partnership with Baidu. </p>
<p>You should sign up for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans">Cloudflare</a> if: </p>
<ol>
	<li>A meaningful portion of your audience is <i>outside </i>of mainland China.</li>
	<li>You would like to use a service (including support) offered in English.</li>
	<li>You do not have an <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/209714777-ICP-FAQ">ICP license</a>.</li>
	<li>You require HTTPS.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should choose the <a href="http://su.baidu.com">Yunjiasu</a> service if:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Your user base is located primarily in mainland China.</li>
	<li>You prefer a service (including support) offered in the Chinese language.</li>
	<li>You have an <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/209714777-ICP-FAQ">ICP license</a>.</li>
	<li>Your domain is HTTP-only.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the China Network is a joint offering, a domain can only be active through one provider at a time. If the domain is currently on Cloudflare, you need to remove the domain from your Cloudflare account, <a href="http://su.baidu.com">sign up</a> for a Yunjiasu account, and add the domain to your Yunjiasu account. The same steps are true if you’re switching from Yunjiasu to Cloudflare.</p>
<p>You can be a user of both Cloudflare and Yunjiasu if you choose to set up different domains between the two services.</p>
