<h2 id="12345679">Overview</h2>
<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) allows user account owners to add an additional layer of login security to Cloudflare accounts. This additional authentication step requires you to provide both something you know, such as a Cloudflare password, and something you have, such as an authentication code from a mobile device.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-note">Cloudflare user accounts configured to use single sign-on (SSO) cannot configure 2FA.
</div>
<p>Cloudflare offers the option to use either a phishing-resistant security key, like a YubiKey, or a Time-Based One-Time password (TOTP) mobile app for authentication, like Google Authenticator, or both. If you add both of these authentication methods to your account, you are initially prompted to log in with the security key, but can opt-out and use TOTP instead.</p>
<p>To ensure that you can securely access your account even without your mobile device, or security keys, Cloudflare also provides backup codes for download. </p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-tip">After downloading your backup codes, we recommend saving them in a secure location.
</div>
<p>As the user account owner, you are automatically assigned the <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205065067#12345682"><u>Super Administrator</u></a> role. Once 2FA is enabled, all Cloudflare account members are required to configure 2FA on their mobile devices.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-note">Free, Pro, and Business customers can only have one Super Administrator. Enterprise customers can have more than one Super Administrator and <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/205065067">assign additional membership roles</a>.
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="12345680"> Enable two-factor authentication for your Cloudflare account</h2>
<p>We recommend that all Cloudflare user account holders enable 2FA to keep their accounts secure. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-warning">Super Administrators can turn on <strong>2FA Enforcement</strong> to require all members to enable 2FA. If you are not a Super Administrator, you will be forced to turn on 2FA prior to accepting the invitation to join a Cloudflare account as a member.
</div><b></b>
<p>To enable two-factor authentication for your Cloudflare login:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard.</li>
	<li>Under the <b>My Profile</b> dropdown, select <b>My Profile</b>.</li>
	<li>Select the <b>Authentication</b> tab. </li>
	<li>Select <b>Manage</b> in the Two-Factor Authentication card.</li>
	<li>Configure either a TOTP mobile app or a security key to enable 2FA on your account.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-warning">Security keys only work with browsers that support the WebAuthn protocol.
</div>
<p>A security key provides phishing-resistant multifactor authentication to your Cloudflare account using a built-in authenticator (Apple Touch ID, Android fingerprint, or Windows Hello) or an external hardware key (like <a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/cloudflare/">YubiKey</a>) that connects to your computer through USB-A, USB-C, NFC, or Bluetooth.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-tip">We strongly recommend configuring multiple security keys. With multiple keys, you can still use 2FA if the primary key is unavailable or if working on a different device.
</div>
<p>Select <b>Manage</b> to configure 2FA security key authentication after <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167906/#6Gqe6f3nZtXSTpwyS2PBZ1">enabling 2FA on your Cloudflare account</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<h4><b>Configure a security key (like YubiKey)</b></h4>
<p>Before you begin, ensure that your hardware security key is configured and plugged in. On a Windows device, you may need to set up Windows Hello or register your security key to your Microsoft account. Review the Windows documentation for more details.</p>

<h2 id="12345683">Issues with two-factor authentication?</h2>
<p>You might lose access to a mobile device, security key, or authentication code. </p>
<h4><b>Use a backup code</b></h4>
<p>Generally, you can solve these issues by using a backup code or retrieving a backup code from your preferred authentication app.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-tip">Google's documentation describes how to <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en&amp;oco=0">transfer Google Authenticator codes from one Android device to another</a>.
</div>
<p>When setting up 2FA, you should have saved your backup codes in a secure location. To restore lost access using a Cloudflare backup code:</p>
<p>1. Retrieve the backup code from where you stored it.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to the Cloudflare login page.</p>
<p>3. Enter the backup code in the login screen, then click<b> Log in</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-note">Once you use a backup code, it becomes invalid.
</div>
<h4><b>Disable 2FA</b></h4>
<p>If you or another account owner still has access to your Cloudflare account, you could disable <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/members">your 2FA settings</a>. </p>
<h4><b>Recover your account</b></h4>
<p>If you do not have access to your 2FA account or backup codes, use a verified device to request a temporary access code.</p>
<p>1. Log into the <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/login">Cloudflare dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>2. On the <b>Two-Factor Authentication </b>page, click <b>Can't access your 2FA device or backup codes?</b>.</p>
<p>3. Click <b>Begin recovery</b>.</p>
<p>4. Using a temporary access code, verify the email address associated with your account.</p>
<p>5. Using a device that you have logged in from before, verify your device. If you clear your cookies often or are logging in from a different IP address, you have wiped our memory of your device and will need to use a different device to verify.</p>
<p>6. For security reasons, you have to wait 3 to 5 days after completing verification to receive your temporary access code.</p>
<h4><b>Still need additional help?</b></h4>
<p>If you are still having issues with your two-factor authentication, follow the instructions provided in the <b>Verify device</b> stage of <b>Recover your account</b>.</p>
