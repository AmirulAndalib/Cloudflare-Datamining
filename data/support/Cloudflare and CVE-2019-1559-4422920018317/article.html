<p><i>How to get rid of warnings about CVE-2019-1559</i></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="h_4zDJUA2VaWmC33hHAMid8s">Overview</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/vulnerability-management/zombie-poodle-goldendoodle/">GOLDENDOODLE and Zombie POODLE attacks</a> affect applications that use certain cipher suites associated with TLS 1.2.</p>
<p>Any application on Cloudflare, however, is not vulnerable to these attacks because Cloudflare does not use the affected version of openssl at its edge.</p>
<p>Cloudflare could not remove these cipher suites from our edge by default because we did not want to break customer applications using legacy cipher suites.</p>

<h2 id="h_1lzDmVy6CWZlwQZkfaIFUO">Remove warnings from external security scanners</h2>
<p>Even though your application is not vulnerable to CVE-2019-1559, some security scanners may flag your application erroneously. </p>
<p>To remove these warnings, you could use <b>Advanced Certificate Manager</b> to exclude the following ciphers from your list of cipher suites:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384</code></li>
	<li><code>ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256</code></li>
	<li><code>ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For how-to steps, refer to our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/ssl-tls/cipher-suites#disable-cipher-suites">developer documentation</a>.</p>
