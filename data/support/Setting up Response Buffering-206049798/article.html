<p><i>Use response buffering to speed up the delivery of small packets from your domain (Enterprise only)</i></p>

<h2 id="h_tbn7PNQ3rAvTJuYRvsOtD">What is response buffering?</h2>
<p>By default, Cloudflare <b>streams </b>data. This means that each packet is sent as it becomes available. Streaming can improve the delivery of large files.</p>
<p>If your domain sends many small packets, however, it might be faster to <b>buffer</b> the file. This approach waits to send the full file until all packets are ready, preventing a client browser from having to re-assemble packets.</p>
