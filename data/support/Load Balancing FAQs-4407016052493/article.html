<h2 id="health-checks">Why is my origin receiving so many health checks?</h2>
<p>This issue may be caused by a combination of two issues.</p>
<h3>Multiple health check regions</h3>
<p>When you <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/how-to/create-monitor#attach-the-monitor-to-a-pool">attach a monitor to a pool</a>, you can specify the <strong>Health Check Regions</strong> that Cloudflare uses to monitor your origin health.</p>
<p>If you select multiple regions or choose <strong>All Data Centers (Enterprise Only)</strong>, you may <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details#how-an-origin-becomes-unhealthy">dramatically increase traffic</a> to that pool and its associated origins. Each region sends individual health checks from 3 data centers. Using <strong>All Data Centers</strong> sends individual health checks from all existing Cloudflare data centers.</p>
<p>To reduce traffic, reduce the number of selected regions or choose an option besides <strong>All Data Centers</strong>.</p>
<h3>Low intervals for health checks</h3>
<p>If you have a low interval for your health checks, you may increase the traffic sent to your origin server.</p>

<h2 id="h_4wg9kQ1xyMWU8HToLDLXRe">Why is my origin or pool considered unhealthy?</h2>
<p>To learn more about how origins and pools become unhealthy, refer to <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details">Origin and pool health</a>.</p>
<p>If you know that your origin server is healthy but load balancing is reporting it as unhealthy, check the following settings on the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/monitors">origin's monitor</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Perform a <code>curl</code> request against the configured endpoint. Make sure the response you are seeing matches your settings for the monitor.</li>
	<li>Ensure your firewall or web server does not block or rate limit <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/monitors#important-notes">our health checks</a> and accepts requests from <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips">Cloudflare IP addresses</a>.</li>
	<li>If you are looking for a specific value in the <strong>Response Body</strong>, make sure that value is relatively static and within the first 10 KB of the HTML page.</li>
	<li>If your origin responds with a <code>301</code> or <code>302</code> status code, make sure <strong>Follow Redirects</strong> is selected.</li>
	<li>Try increasing the <strong>Timeout</strong> value.</li>
	<li>Review the <strong>Host Header</strong> for the health check.</li>
	<li>If you are using Authenticated Origin Pulls, Argo Smart Routing, make sure that you entered a zone value for <strong>Simulate Zone</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_4GoEXgENNNaH04ZRdWCCAO">Why does my load balancer route traffic to a secondary pool when the primary pool is still healthy?</h2>
<p>You occasionally might see traffic routed away from a pool if a health check fails from a specific data center (even if the origin is still healthy). That data center may direct a small number of requests to another pool that is considered healthy by that data center.</p>

<h2 id="h_3XggCWr9rAWSsI7ZQG8Lob">What is the difference between Load Balancing and Health Checks?</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/">Cloudflare Load Balancing</a> helps monitor origin server health and — based on that and other information — route incoming requests accordingly. Individual origin servers have monitors attached, which issue health checks at regular intervals.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/4404867308429">Cloudflare Health Checks </a>are identical to monitors within a load balancer, but only meant for probing server health (and not distributing traffic).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="h_21M4fGz8eFSc0hOJIzCnlR">Why do I see different numbers of requests in Load Balancing Analytics?</h2>
<p>You may see different numbers of requests when reviewing <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/load-balancing-analytics">Load Balancing Analytics</a>, especially when compared to other Cloudflare dashboards (Caching, etc.).</p>
<p>Load balancing <strong>requests</strong> are the number of uncached requests made by your load balancer. By default, Cloudflare caches resolved IP addresses for up to five seconds. This built-in caching is often the cause of an discrepancies.</p>
