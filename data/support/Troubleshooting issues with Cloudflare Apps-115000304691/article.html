<p>If you have trouble with an App installed from Cloudflare Apps onto your site:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Verify that the app is placing itself in the location you expect on the page. You might have to scroll the page or choose a new location to find it.</li>
	<li>Be sure to carefully read the description and view the app's screenshots, it's possible the app works in a way you did not expect.</li>
	<li>Ensure that your site has at least the <a href="http://htmlshell.com/">basic skeleton</a> of a legitimate HTML page. </li>
	<li>Ask for help on the <a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Community Forums</a> in the area specially devoted to answering App questions.</li>
	<li>Reach out to the <b>Support Contact email address</b> listed on the right-side of the App's info page.</li>
	<li>Check your browser's developer tools for Javascript errors, they may help explain how the app is interacting with your site.</li>
	<li>Disable Rocket Loader in the Performance tab, as the reordering of Javascript calls may be causing the issue.</li>
	<li>Unfortunately due to the complex nature of websites, it's possible this app isn't compatible with your site. Look in the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/">Cloudflare Apps listing </a>for alternatives.</li>
</ol>
