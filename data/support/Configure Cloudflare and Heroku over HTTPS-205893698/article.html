<h2 id="h_18ZkGTJvse2cBIUyUZWxGo">Overview</h2>
<p>Heroku is a cloud PaaS that supports several pre-configured programming languages. Heroku deals with all your infrastructure so you can focus on your application without having to work at the command line.</p>
<p>This article describes how to configure Heroku with Cloudflare to serve your traffic over HTTPS. For this article, we'll assume that you already have an <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/sections/200820158-CloudFlare-101">active domain on Cloudflare</a>, as well as a running Heroku app.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="h_7EiSbDF6TsL8KgNBSYNxUM"> Step 1 - Add a custom domain to your Heroku app</h2>
<p>Follow Heroku's instructions: <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains">Custom Domain Names for Apps</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="h_7bixLlfoVeHWXsQmSa6Rzy">Step 2 - Add a subdomain in Cloudflare DNS</h2>
<p>Below, you will need to add DNS records for a subdomain and a root domain. Learn how to <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360019093151">Managing DNS records in Cloudflare</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 2a - Add a subdomain</h3>
<p>To start, log in to your Cloudflare account, navigate to the <b>DNS</b> app and add a 'www' <i>CNAME</i> record that points to the custom domain (also known as <i>DNS target</i>) that you obtained in Step 1 above for your subdomain.</p>
<h3>Step 2b - Add your root domain</h3>
<p>Adding a root or apex domain on Heroku also requires using a CNAME record pointed from your root. You cannot use A records on Heroku because no IP addresses are exposed for Heroku users to use.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Cloudflare offers <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017421192-Cloudflare-DNS-FAQ#h_41430356531541184358992">CNAME flattening</a> to resolve requests for your root domain.</p>
<p>Add a CNAME record for your root (e.g. example.com) and point it to DNS target you obtained in Step 1 above for your domain.</p>

<h2 id="h_4D4QEZtdtUlDEQpVRfvhgs">Step 3 - Confirm that your domain is routed through Cloudflare</h2>
<p>The easiest way to confirm that Cloudflare is working for your domain is to issue a cURL command.</p>
<pre>╰─➤  curl -I www.example.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 23 Jan 2018 18:51:30 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: public, max-age=0
Last-Modified: Mon, 31 Dec 1979 04:08:00 GMT
X-Powered-By: Express
Server: cloudflare
CF-RAY: 3e1cf1d936f28c52-SFO-DOG</pre>
You can identify Cloudflare-proxied requests by the <i>CF-Ray</i> response header. If either of these two are present, your requests are being proxied by Cloudflare accordingly.<p>You can repeat the above cURL command for any of the subdomains that you have configured within your DNS settings.

<h2 id="h_6utrjO8ud5pDqYtf20idAg"> Step 4 - Configure your domain for SSL</h2>
<h3>Step 4a - Enable SSL</h3>
<p>Cloudflare provides a SANs wildcard certificate with all paid plans, and a SNI wildcard certificate with the Free plan. Full details on SSL <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't know what this means, navigate to the <b>Overview</b> tab of the <b>SSL/TLS</b> app in your Cloudflare dashboard. Select <i>Flexible</i> mode to serve your site over HTTPS to all public visitors.</p>
<p>Once the certificate status changes to <b>• Active Certificate</b>, incoming traffic will be served to your site over HTTPS (e.g., visitors will see HTTPS prefixed to your domain name in the browser bar).  </p>
<h3>Step 4b - Force all traffic over HTTPS</h3>
<p>To ensure all traffic to your site is encrypted, Cloudflare lets you force an automatic HTTPS redirect.  To configure this, consult: <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200170536">How do I redirect all visitors to HTTPS/SSL?</a></p>
<p>You can then use a cURL command to verify that all requests are being forced over HTTPS.
</p>
<pre>╰─➤  curl -I -L example.com
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Tue, 23 Jan 2018 23:17:44 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
Expires: Wed, 24 Jan 2018 00:17:44 GMT
Location: https://example.com/
Server: cloudflare
CF-RAY: 3e1e77d5c42b8c52-SFO-DOG</pre>
If SSL was not working for your domain (e.g. your SSL certificate has not yet been issued), you would see a <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115003011431#525error">525</a> or <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115003011431#526error">526</a> HTTP response after the redirect.<p>Please note that the issuing of a Universal SSL certificate typically takes up to 24 hours. Our paid SSL certificates issue within 10-15 minutes. </p>
