<h2 id="jyI294z2pZk9aMMCzbH8Y">Overview</h2>
<p>By default, videos on Cloudflare Stream are viewable by anyone at any time, until you delete the video. Users can view the source of the embed code in their browser and get a URL to the video to share it with others.</p>
<p>
	There are two options to secure your Cloudflare Stream video: by enabling signed URLs or restricting the domains that can embed the video.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="12UQYDwiTlqmTAN2ZytTlj">Enable Signed URLs</h2>
<p>Enabling Signed URLs adds an additional layer of security to your video as it restricts the available viewing period to your desired time frame.</p>
<p>To enable Signed URLs in the Cloudflare dashboard:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to your Cloudflare account.</li>
	<li>Select the domain for which you would like to secure a Stream video.</li>
	<li>Click the <b>Stream </b>icon in the dashboard.</li>
	<li>Scroll down and click on the video that you would like to secure. </li>
	<li>In the menu that appears, click the <b>Require Signed URLs </b>checkbox.</li>
	<li>Before using the embed code to add the Stream video to your site, you must <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/security/signed-urls/">create a signing key</a> and add that key to the embed code in the Cloudflare dashboard.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-warning">If <strong>Require Signed URLs</strong> is enabled and you do not add the signed key to the embed code, your video will not play. You must create a signing key and add it to the Stream embed code prior to embedding the video on your site.
</div>
<p>To learn how to enable signed URLs via the API, see the Stream <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/security/signed-urls/">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3vxVmgugDD8HGumm688AHX">Restrict domains that can embed Stream video</h2>
<p>You can also use the Cloudflare Stream dashboard UI to restrict the domain(s) that can embed your video.</p>
<p>To do this, follow Steps 1-4 above, then:</p>
<p>5. Enter the domain(s) that are allowed to embed the video separated by commas.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-info">Cloudflare Stream video preview in the dashboard is disabled when setting domain restrictions. However, the video will play when embedded.
