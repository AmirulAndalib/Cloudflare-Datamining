<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-info">Status Codes analytics by data center is exclusive to the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/contact/">enterprise level of service</a>.
</div>
Status Codes metrics in the Cloudflare dashboard <b>Analytics</b> app provide customers with a deeper insight into the distribution of errors that are occurring on their website per data center. A data center facility where Cloudflare runs its servers that make up our edge network. You can find a list of all of Cloudflare data centers <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/">here</a>. <p>HTTP status codes that we see in a response passing through our edge are displayed in analytics. These codes can be split into three groups: ‘edge network errors’, ‘origin errors’ and '52x errors'.</p>
<p>Errors that originate from our edge servers -such as 502, 503, and 504 with 'Cloudflare'- are not reported as part of the error analytics. However, errors such as 52x, can inform you about problems with your server.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-note">Users may also see 100x errors which are not reported. These will be displayed as either 403 or 409 (edge) errors.

<h2 id="h_1Fb3xv4SnY894RwTV4oc3P"> Edge Network errors</h2>
<ul>
	<li>400 - Bad Request intercepted at the Cloudflare Edge (e.g. missing or bad HTTP header)</li>
	<li>403* - Security functionality (e.g. Web Application Firewall, Browser Integrity Check, CAPTCHAs, and most 1xxx error codes)</li>
	<li>409* - DNS errors typically in the form of 1000 or 1001 error code</li>
	<li>413 - File size upload exceeded the maximum size allowed (configured under the Speed app)</li>
	<li>444 - Used by Nginx to indicate that the server has returned no information to the client, and closed the connection. This error code is internal to Nginx and is <b>not </b>returned to the client.</li>
	<li>499 - Used by Nginx to indicate when a connection has been closed by the client while the server is still processing its request, making the server unable to send a status code back.
	</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="h_21WMs0Fw9dipTbWyTiZ4uj">Origin errors</h2>
<ul>
	<li>400 - Origin rejected the request due to bad, or unsupported syntax sent by the application.</li>
	<li>404 - Only if the origin triggered a 404 response for a request.</li>
	<li>4xx</li>
	<li>50x</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="h_2UtGFR4GfRXsNDI7wZJBGo">503 errors</h2>
<p>We do count 503 errors from your origin that are passed as a response from the edge, though in this version 503 errors from the edge have multiple potential sources.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your origin server had a 503.  We received this from the origin and the status code was in the response from the on the edge</li>
	<li>Cloudflare detected malicious Layer 7 traffic and automatically issued a JS challenge that blocked the request</li>
	<li>IUAM - This also logs every blocked request</li>
	<li>Websocket rate-limit error</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="h_3VPW9Ekh0e580wUvfawvQv"> 52x errors</h2>
<ul>
	<li>520 - This is essentially a "catch-all" response for when the origin server returns something unexpected, or something that is not tolerated/cannot be interpreted by our edge (i.e. protocol violation or empty response).</li>
	<li>522 - Our edge could not establish a TCP connection to the origin server.</li>
	<li>523 - Origin server is unreachable (e.g. the origin IP changed but DNS was not updated, or due to network issues between our edge and the origin).</li>
	<li>524 - Our edge established a TCP connection, but the origin did not reply with a HTTP response before the connection timed out.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="h_73hbSMqWRjBKUeEGVUU4Cj">Status codes </h2>
<p>The status codes section shows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The error code returned in the response</li>
	<li>The time-stamp for the "bucket" you selected</li>
	<li>The total count of that specific error code for that time-stamp</li>
	<li>The % of total requests that serves that error</li>
</ul>
<p>You can filter out specific error(s) by selecting one or more in the legend. Once you select an error it will be greyed out in the drop-down menu, and the error will no longer display as part of the graph.</p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/slt3lc6tev37/1RqlmdZlCe2PpgClyZaCbI/f725271eb4a92f8cb83443b57d9ea4a8/hc-import-status_codes_error_by_data_center.png" alt="Old URL: https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/article_attachments/360040366332/status_codes_error_by_data_center.png

<p>In this example, by clicking on “404” in the legend we removed it from being displayed in the UI.</p>
