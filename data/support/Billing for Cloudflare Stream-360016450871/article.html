<h2 id="billing">Cloudflare Stream billing</h2>
<p>Cloudflare Stream is billed on a monthly basis. Since Stream is usage-based, you will be billed on the minutes watched and stored for the previous month. For example, your September invoice will include charges for Stream usage in August.</p>
<p></p>

When enabled, you will receive a notification to the billing email address on file when the traffic, queries, requests, or minutes watched exceed your desired threshold.

<h2 id="billable-minutes">Cloudflare Stream billable minutes</h2>
<p>Billable minutes represent the time spent delivering video from Cloudflare to your visitors.</p>
<p>If a site visitor loads a video and does not watch it, Cloudflare will still charge for video delivery. However, if the visitor’s browser caches the video locally, Cloudflare does not charge for time spent watching it. In other words, if the visitor watches the video multiple times, we will not charge for subsequent views.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-note">If you use the preload attribute (described in Stream API documentation) in the embed code, we charge for the minutes spent preloading the video.
</div>
<p>Cloudflare Stream preloading behavior varies by browser. Some browsers pre-load a few seconds of video while others pre-load the entire video. Although preloading is useful in optimizing video availability, consider if it is appropriate for your use case.</p>
<p>You can view your Cloudflare Stream billable minutes in the Cloudflare dashboard to estimate the charge for minutes delivered.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-note">Cloudflare Stream's billing cost includes charges for both minutes watched and minutes stored.
</div>
<p>To view your Stream minutes watched, </p>
