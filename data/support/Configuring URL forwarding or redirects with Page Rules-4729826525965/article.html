<h2 id="h_1yNvnmQI1k2kpjiFQ0QR3P">Overview</h2>
<p>If you want to forward or redirect traffic to a different URL, you have the following options using Cloudflare:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/dynamic-redirects/">Dynamic Redirects</a>: Allow you to create powerful URL redirects like redirects based on the source country of requests.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/">Bulk Redirects</a>: Allow you to define a large number (thousands or even millions) of essentially static URL redirects at the account level.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="#how-to">Page Rules</a>: Should only be used when the other two options do not meet your use case.

<h2 id="how-to">Redirect with Page Rules</h2>
<p>
</p>
<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-note">Page Rule subdomains require an <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records">"Orange Clouded"</a> DNS record for the Page Rule to work. Page Rules won't apply to subdomains that don't exist in DNS or aren't being directed to Cloudflare.
</div>
<p>To configure URL forwarding or redirects using Page Rules:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Log into your Cloudflare account.</li>
	<li>Click the appropriate Cloudflare account for the domain where you want to add URL forwarding.</li>
	<li>Go to <b>Rules</b> &gt; <b>Page Rules</b>.</li>
	<li>Under <b>Page Rules, </b>click <b>Create Page Rule</b>. The <i>Create Page Rule for &lt;your domain&gt;</i> dialog opens.</li>
	<li>Under <b>If the URL matches</b>, enter the URL or URL pattern that should match the rule. </li>
	<li>In <b>Pick a Setting</b>, choose <b>Forwarding URL </b>from the drop-down menu.</li>
	<li>For <b>Select status code</b>,<b> </b>choose <i>301 (Permanent Redirect) </i>or <i>302 (Temporary Redirect)</i>.</li>
	<li>Enter the <i>destination URL</i>.</li>
	<li>To finish, click <b>Save and Deploy</b>.</li>

<div class="cf-sidebar-2 cf-warning">Traffic must pass through Cloudflare for Page Rules to work. If you only use Cloudflare for DNS, Page Rules are not active.
</div>
<p>Imagine you want site visitors to easily reach your website for a variety of URL patterns.  For instance, the Page Rule URL patterns <i>*www.example.com/products</i> and <i>*example.com/products </i>match:</p>
<p></p>
<pre> http://example.com/products

 http://www.example.com/products

 https://www.example.com/products

 https://blog.example.com/products

 https://www.blog.example.com/products</pre>
but do not match:
<pre>http://www.example.com/blog/products (extra directory before the +)  
or
http://www.example.comproducts (no trailing slash)</pre>
Once you have created the pattern that matches what you want, click the <b>Forwarding</b> toggle. That exposes a field where you can enter the address I want requests forwarded to.
<pre>https://example.com/products</pre>

If I enter the address above in the forwarding box and click <b>Add Rule</b>, within a few seconds any requests that match the pattern I entered will automatically be forwarded with a 302 Redirect to the new URL.

<h2 id="h_53Wv490V4xQG351E96JIAA"> Advanced forwarding options</h2>
<p>If you use a basic redirect, such as forwarding the root domain to www.example.com, then you lose anything else in the URL.</p>
<p>For example, you could set up the pattern:\
</p>
<pre>example.com</pre>
And have it forward to:
<pre>http://www.example.com</pre>
However, if someone entered:
example.com/some-particular-page.html
They would be redirected to:
<pre>www.example.com</pre>
Instead of:
<pre>www.example.com/some-particular-page.html
</pre>

The solution is to use variables. Each wildcard corresponds to a variable when can be referenced in the forwarding address. The variables are represented by a $ followed by a number. To refer to the first wildcard you'd use $1, to refer to the second wildcard you'd use $2, and so on.<p>To fix the forwarding from the root to www in the above example, you could use the same pattern:
</p>
<pre>example.com/*</pre>
You'd then set up the following URL for traffic to forward to:
<pre>http://www.example.com/$1</pre>
In this case, if someone went to:
<pre>example.com/some-particular-page.html</pre>
They'd be redirected to:
<pre> http://www.example.com/some-particular-page.html</pre>
