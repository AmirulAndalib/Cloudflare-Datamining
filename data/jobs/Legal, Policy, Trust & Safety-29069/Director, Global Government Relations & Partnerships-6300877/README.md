<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Public Policy at Cloudflare</strong></h4>
<p>Cloudflare is one of the most dynamic and innovative companies operating on the Internet. At a time when policy and regulation are fundamentally changing the Internet and the way tech companies do business, we believe it is important to engage in discussions with governments to share Cloudflare’s unique approach.
