Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><strong>Public Policy at Cloudflare</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the scope, complexity, and diversity of the company’s work, our Public Policy team members must be flexible, talented and able to work collaboratively across multi-functional teams to find and present policy solutions, to carry the Cloudflare narrative and promote the public policy brand externally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare’s Public Policy team helps the company by anticipating regulatory challenges, acting as an external advocate for Cloudflare on priority policy issues and identifying opportunities to build relationships with external partners.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is small but growing, and is often tasked with addressing global policy issues on top of local market priorities. This is a fast-moving work environment with goals that are closely linked to business priorities, however, policy issues are typically within the areas of cybersecurity, data protection/privacy and intermediary liability.</span></p>
