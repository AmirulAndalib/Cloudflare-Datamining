	<div>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>About Cloudflare’s content marketing team</strong></p>
<p>The content marketing team writes, edits, and manages content for use in marketing and sales campaigns — articles, event presentations, videos, promotional copy, and more. We work most closely with designers, web producers, product marketers, campaign managers, and event planners, but also collaborate as needed with people across the entire organization.</p>
<p><strong>About the Senior Content Marketer role</strong></p>
<p>The Senior Content Marketer will develop a strong understanding of Cloudflare’s prospects, products, and differentiators, and use that knowledge to create content for use in a variety of marketing activities. This is a writing-heavy role, but the ideal candidate will also understand best practices for using content in marketing programs, especially events and campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The role’s primary responsibilities are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Writing thought leadership content (e.g. blogs, ebooks, whitepapers) and working with marketing colleagues (e.g designers and web producers) to publish and promote it</li>
	<li>Working with colleagues, partners, and customers to create content for owned and third-party conferences</li>
	<li>Working with marketing colleagues to identify content gaps and opportunities</li>
	<li>Editing content written by colleagues and freelancers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who we’re looking for in a candidate:</strong></p>
<p>The ideal candidate is someone with 5+ years' full-time experience in a writing-heavy marketing role. Prior experience in enterprise technology / software is required, and IT or cybersecurity experience is highly desirable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on this experience, we expect the ideal candidate to be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An excellent writer, who is capable of clear, concise, persuasive communication</li>
	<li>A thoughtful editor, who can improve a written piece’s grammar and structure to increase clarity and impact&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A determined project manager, who can work independently and creatively to drive complex content projects through fast turnarounds and multiple review rounds</li>
	<li>Sincerely interested in the deep technical details of how the Internet and related technologies work — and healthily skeptical about buzzwords, jargon, and flimsy business logic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please provide the following in your application:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A resume demonstrating that you match the above descriptions</li>
	<li>A brief (1 page or less) cover letter answering the question “What interests you about this position?”</li>
</ul>
