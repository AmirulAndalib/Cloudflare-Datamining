<p><strong>About the Team</strong></p>
<p>The BDR program has two goals—generate qualified pipeline opportunities and develop business development representatives’ careers. We care deeply about both goals.</p>
<p>We have worked purposefully over the last 2 years to increase the percentage of our new business revenue that comes from the outbound BDR team by partnering closely with our internal customers, Account Executives, to generate high quality pipeline opportunities. During that time we have also helped many BDRs grow into Account Executive and Customer Success roles. As we scale, BDRs are also starting to find homes in other roles across the Sales Engineering, Sales Operations, Marketing, and Partner teams.</p>
<p>While accomplishing these two goals we strive to be a team that always “puts our Cloudflare hat on” and focuses on the best interests of the company.</p>
