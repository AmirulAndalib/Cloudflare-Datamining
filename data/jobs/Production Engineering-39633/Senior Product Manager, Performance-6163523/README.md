<h4>About the Role</h4>
<p>At Cloudflare, we are helping to build a better Internet, and part of that is being the fastest network in the world.&nbsp; We’re looking for a product manager who will make sure that the infrastructure we build meets the needs of our customers and that we’re building an environment to make every single one of our products and services as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Performance PM will build foundational services and systems that allow Cloudflare products to not only be the fastest products in their respective markets, but also that allow Cloudflare products to get the most out of the network they run on.&nbsp; You will transform Cloudflare’s architecture to further solidify that performance is a first class citizen in our network, even down to how code is compiled before being deployed. No stone is left unturned for you as you work with our engineering and product teams to not only optimize every line of code to be as fast as possible, but build systems that identify slow services and areas for optimization. While you’re building these systems to make sure each of our products is always the fastest in their markets, you’ll be crafting the narrative to tell this story to our customers and their teams and so that everyone knows Cloudflare products are always the fastest.</p>
<p>As a member of a growing team of infrastructure product managers your responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Represent the customer, be it internal or external. Be the champion and voice of customers. Build intimate, personal customer relationships. Bring the customer's voice into the creation process.</li>
	<li>Develop the platform vision for your area. Ensure that your vision can work not just for your current set of customers, but for 10 or even 100 times your current set.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Evangelize the vision so that all stakeholders are aligned, have context and understand where we are going.</li>
	<li>Make data-driven roadmap decisions.&nbsp; Make tough tactical prioritization decisions based off of data you collect, curate, and disseminate.&nbsp; Build trust with stakeholders by ensuring that your roadmap is understandable and sensible based on the data you present.</li>
	<li>Measure success. Own the measures used to define success for your product. Success measures must be defined at the inception of a product and tracked throughout its lifecycle. Make measures visible to all stakeholders and interpret them into actionable conclusions and new hypotheses.</li>
	<li>Author use cases and prioritize requirements. Translate observations and customer feedback into a prioritized product backlog.&nbsp; Author use cases based on specific real-world product applications and extrapolate detailed product requirements for the scenarios.</li>
	<li>Collaborate across teams. We win or lose as a team. Product managers play a critical role in creating alignment between engineering teams and stakeholders. A collaborative attitude is essential to the job.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience</h4>
<p>The ideal candidate is customer-focused, data-driven, methodical and thrives in a goal-oriented and data-driven environment.&nbsp; You have a deep technical understanding of the observability space and outstanding communication and collaboration skills.&nbsp; You are able to work with a diverse group, get consensus, and drive the product forward.&nbsp; You are execution focused, you emphasize getting things done while paying attention to important details. You have a passion for building frameworks that scale massively and make it easy for all teams to get the most out of data as you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>8+ years of previous product management experience</li>
	<li>Domain expertise in making deployment decisions based on data.&nbsp; You have been there, done that as either an architect or product owner for safe change or very closely related technology space</li>
	<li>Distributed systems experience that allows you to drive the scaling strategy for deployment as our scale grows both on volume and number of internal customers supporting.</li>
	<li>Experience presenting new products and features to customers – whether as a developer, analyst or product manager. You are enthusiastic about taking something you have helped build and sharing it with the world</li>
	<li>Strong customer and stakeholder empathy. You must be the voice of engineering, customers, support, or ops at any given time. You must be able to channel many points of view into a strategic roadmap and deliverables that provide elegant solutions to all requirements.</li>
	<li>Exceptional communication, presentation, organizational and analytical skills</li>
	<li>Demonstrated ability to lead, drive consensus and deliver in a matrixed organization with multiple stakeholders</li>
	<li>Experience working with large and complex data sets (SQL, Postgres, Prometheus, etc.).&nbsp; You are skilled at proving points with data and can quickly show others how to do so.</li>
	<li>Experience with telemetry pipelines (Metrics/Traces) and a very good understanding of modern observability platforms&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Ability to communicate complex technical concepts to all audiences</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bonus Points</h4>
<ul>
	<li>BS/MS in a technology- or business-related field</li>
	<li>Hands-on experience with command-line tools used for interacting with APIs, debugging and testing (e.g. curl, dig, etc.)</li>
	<li>Scripting/programming experience (Python, Go, etc.) and/or experience with web frameworks</li>
</ul>
