<h4><strong>Available Location: Brussels, Belgium</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Public Policy at Cloudflare</strong></h4>
<p>Because of the scope, complexity, and diversity of the company’s work, our Public Policy team members must be flexible, talented and able to work collaboratively across multi-functional teams to find and present policy solutions, to carry the Cloudflare narrative and promote the public policy brand externally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloudflare’s Public Policy team helps the company by anticipating regulatory challenges, acting as an external advocate for Cloudflare on priority policy issues and identifying opportunities to build relationships with external partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team is relatively small but growing, and is often tasked with addressing global policy issues on top of local market priorities. This is a fast-moving work environment with goals that are closely linked to business priorities, however, policy issues are typically within the areas of cybersecurity, data protection/privacy, connectivity and intermediary liability.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for an intern for a six-month period to help support our European Public Policy team, based in Brussels. <strong>The start date for this role is foreseen on 28 February 2024</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the intern will consist of working day-to-day with the European Public Policy team across a wide range of work streams and projects including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Help the Public Policy team to maintain internal knowledge databases, draft EU stakeholder maps and support with issue tracking</li>
	<li>Support the team in evaluating EU policy and legislative developments, and support work to understand the impact on Cloudflare across its full product set, including attending relevant events (for instance in the European Parliament and conferences) and providing internal updates to the Public Policy team</li>
	<li>Participate in developing talking points, policy narratives and presentation materials for use at external events and meetings and for other communication purposes (company blog, position papers, consultation responses etc)</li>
	<li>Help compile materials for use by Cloudflare's sales and marketing teams to respond to policy-related questions raised by our customers and potential customers</li>
	<li>Support work to build and maintain relationships with key policy makers, relevant policy makers and officials from the European Institutions, as well as within any identified national markets</li>
	<li>Take part in engagement with business and civil society entities, including associations of which we are an active member</li>
	<li>Support in providing daily/real-time and other updates to colleagues from the Cloudflare Public Policy, Legal, Trust &amp; Safety Teams and other internal stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>The position will require an active, self-starting individual with an academic background, a knowledge of and a curiosity for our business, in particular cyber security, connectivity/telecoms, content policy and privacy issues. Some prior work or internship experience within a (technology) company or association, and/or within the EU institutions working on relevant policy topics will be an asset. Perfect knowledge of English as a working language (written &amp; oral) is required. Knowledge of French is an asset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The position is remunerated and some, limited, travel within Europe may be required.</p>
