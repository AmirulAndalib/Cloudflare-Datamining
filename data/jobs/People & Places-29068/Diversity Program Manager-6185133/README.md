<p>At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. We aim to be a highly admired, iconic company that will endure for generations. Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are critical to that. We believe that more diverse teams are more innovative. More diverse teams make better decisions.
