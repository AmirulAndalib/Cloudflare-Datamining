We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</p>
<h3>About the team</h3>
<p>We are a team of software engineers who build distributed systems critical to keeping Cloudflare’s network operating smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<p>We work with the latest Linux network technologies and low-level details of network protocols. But we're also responsible for sophisticated automated control systems.&nbsp; The code we write runs on thousands of servers in hundreds of data centres around the world.</p>
<p>As the scale of Cloudflare's network and the variety of services we offer continue to grow, so do the challenges we tackle.</p>
<h3>What you'll do</h3>
<p>You’ll participate in the<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/"> ongoing development of a load distribution system that works</a> at the scale of Cloudflare’s edge network. Millions of users and customers depend upon this system every hour of every day, even if it isn’t visible to them. You’ll take on challenging projects that require focus and determination, pragmatism and innovation, and careful consideration of risk. You’ll get to know the details of Cloudflare’s software and hardware infrastructure in order to design software that behaves well even when failures occur. You’ll collaborate with engineers across the company, from operations teams to the teams that build our customer-facing products. You’ll inspect the production behaviour of our systems, to check that they are working as intended and spot opportunities for improvement. You’ll be part of the on-call rota for the occasional cases when our operations teams need to escalate problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What we are looking for</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for smart, innovative team players that have broad experience covering some or all of Linux kernel network stack development (particularly eBPF), complex distributed systems written in Go, understanding of Internet protocols and technologies like IP, TCP, UDP, QUIC, DNS, HTTPS, BGP - and the curiosity to learn more about these things. You will be in a team that questions everything to get to the most appropriate solution in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>People who excel in this role:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Willing to write code in Go.</li>
	<li>Relish opportunities to dive into new technologies, and a demonstrated ability to do so.</li>
	<li>Awareness of networking concepts down to layer 2.</li>
	<li>Commitment to high code quality standards, both individually and working as part of a team.</li>
	<li>Comfortable understanding and working with complex distributed systems.</li>
	<li>Understanding of techniques to manage risk when evolving critical systems.</li>
	<li>Excellent communicator and team player.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonus Points:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Skills the role requires; we’re happy to help you learn on the job, but prior experience is beneficial</p>
<ul>
	<li>Experience with Linux kernel network stack development (eBPF).</li>
	<li>Solid understanding of routing protocols, particularly BGP</li>
</ul>
