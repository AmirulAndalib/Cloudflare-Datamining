	<div>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>About the Department</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare’s Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles about 10% of HTTP requests on the Internet today. We also build and run the internal tools that builds and runs our software. The Engineering Team is split into two groups: one handles product development and the other handles operations. Product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base. The operations team handles one of the world’s largest networks with data centers in 102 cities worldwide.</span></p>
<p><strong>About the Role&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Back in 2014, Cloudflare launched Universal SSL to provide all of our customers with the security of encrypted traffic between visitors and Cloudflare’s network. On the day we flipped the switch, we doubled the amount of sites using SSL/TLS on the internet. Since then, we’ve been working on providing even more ways to encrypt traffic easier and more effectively. To better serve our customers, we’re constantly improving our systems for issuing, managing, and deploying TLS certificates. By joining Cloudflare’s Security Engineering team, you can help ensure that every site owner has the ability to provide their users with a secure connection.</p>
<p>Your code will help ensure millions of websites have access to encryption. As such, the results of your code will be felt by millions of site owners and billions of visitors every day. We’re continuously providing technology to site owners that was previously only available to the largest organizations. Your contributions will help make the web a faster, safer, better, and more heavily encrypted place.</p>
<p><strong>What you'll do</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare is looking for a Web Services Engineer to help us build services (small or micro) with RESTful APIs and their own datastores using Python and Go. You will also write/update a spec for your service, so others know how it works. In this role you will integrate multiple services via message queue-like (Kafka) systems and evaluate 3rd party and open source tools. You will have the opportunity to contribute to open source projects that we use internally and build tools to allow other departments to keep track of certificate status. You will design and implement alerts, write procedures for ops to handle such alerts, or be escalated-to around unresolved operational issues. You will also need to read and understand code from a legacy codebase to migrate logic to a modern services architecture and review the code of fellow engineers via pull requests.</p>
