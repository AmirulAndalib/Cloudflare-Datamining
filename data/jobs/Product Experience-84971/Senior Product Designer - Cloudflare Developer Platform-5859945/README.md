<h4><strong>About our team</strong></h4>
<p>The Product Experience team is a diverse group of creative people that love to learn, collaborate, solve large-scale problems, and grow together. We're looking for a curious, user-focused, and action-oriented Senior Product Designer that is driven to design the best product experiences for the Developer Platform.</p>
<p>The Developer Platform is a part of the Emerging Technologies &amp; Incubation (ETI) organization where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a massively successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your impact</strong></p>
<p>As a Senior Product Designer, you will work closely with other designers, engineers, product managers, and stakeholders to drive the best end-to-end experiences for developers. Your work will impact the developer experiences of a growing platform of products including Cloudflare Pages, Workers, R2, Databases, Media, AI, and more. While this is not a managerial role with direct reports, we expect our Senior Product Designers to lead by example and coach the team into doing their best work.</p>
<p>If you're a systems-thinking Senior Product Designer who's excited to work on significant, meaningful, and complex problems with real-world impact, come help us make the Internet better! We'd love to hear from you.</p>

	<li>Distill complex problems into approachable steps through researching, sketching, and sharing ideas with your cross-functional team.</li>
	<li>Partner with product managers and engineering leaders to work through technical tradeoffs that affect product roadmaps.</li>
	<li>Partner with other designers on the developer platform design team to collaborate on shared patterns, product vision, and design goals.</li>

	<li>Share what you learn internally and with the broader public designer, developer, and technology communities.</li>
	<li>Influence and contribute to the internal design process and team culture, supporting the team's current and long-term objectives.</li>
	<li>Drive the adoption of new design tools and methodologies to enhance team efficiency and product design.</li>
	<li>Make time to mentor other designers on the team and share your craft, learning as you teach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Find ways to grow design's impact within the organization, spending time to share design decisions throughout the organization that would benefit other teams and product areas.</strong></p>

	<li>8+ years working in professional UX, interaction design, or product design roles.</li>
