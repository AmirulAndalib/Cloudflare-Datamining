<h4>About the Role</h4>
<p>We are looking for a highly technical and experienced product manager to own our Zero Trust device agent, Cloudflare WARP.</p>
<p>In the last five years, Cloudflare has built the next phase of our product journey on top of our network to solve another challenge facing every small team and enterprise on the planet: ensuring the people and teams within an organization can access the tools they need to do their jobs and are safe from data loss and threats.</p>
<p>To do that, we released<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/"><strong>Cloudflare Zero Trust</strong></a><strong>, </strong>a platform built on Cloudflare’s network to secure users, devices, and data in organizations of any size. Cloudflare Zero Trust consists of multiple products that deliver a comprehensive solution. Those products include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/access/"><strong>Cloudflare Access</strong></a>, built to replace VPNs and protect internally-managed applications.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/"><strong>Cloudflare Tunnel</strong></a>, the best way to connect your infrastructure to anything else.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/gateway/"><strong>Cloudflare Gateway</strong></a>, a tool that keeps team members protected from malware and other threats on the Internet.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/browser-isolation/"><strong>Cloudflare Browser Isolation</strong></a>, the Internet’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-zero-trust-platform-built-for-speed/">fastest</a> browser isolation technology that also keeps users and data safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of those products use Cloudflare’s network to secure and accelerate connections, to deliver services closer to the user than other approaches. We have been thrilled with the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-one-year-later/">customer response</a> as thousands of teams start this journey with us, but we need your help to keep building.</p>
<p>Cloudflare Zero Trust relies on our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/warp-for-desktop/">Zero Trust Agent</a> to onramp devices and their traffic to our edge in ways that significantly improve the traditional VPN Client-&gt;Server model. Our device agent runs on all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, Chrome, iOS) and is one of the few pieces of software at Cloudflare used by administrators and end users alike.</p>
<p>The client is built on the technology that powers the Cloudflare WARP service, a popular consumer offering that millions of users around the world rely on to connect to the Internet. The goal of our agent is to not just create software that is reliable and usable for administrators, but one that is inclusive, accessible and usable by employees of every company around the world..</p>
<h4>What you'll do</h4>
<p>You will be the Product Manager for our Zero Trust agent and associated services, owning the device onramp for all Cloudflare One and Cloudflare Zero Trust scenarios. You will lead all efforts related to the agent, directly supporting engineering, sales and support.</p>
<p>In this large and highly visible role, you will shape the product, working closely with the engineer teams and other functions across Cloudflare, to listen to customer problems and devise solutions that solve them. You will work to ensure the agent, which sits on the devices of millions of users, is inclusive and accessible to all. You will solve problems that have wide impact and significance, shaping the future of security on the Internet.</p>
<p>We operate with very small teams of highly motivated and experienced engineers and product professionals. You need real world experience shipping and supporting applications on all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux Android, iOS), what deployment of software looks like in large enterprises and the ability to help customers troubleshoot complex deployment issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be successful in this role, you will need an exceptional understanding of what it takes to build and ship client software at scale, and a deep desire to learn. As a product that has low-level network interactions with all parts of the enterprise stack, you will need both technical depth, and empathy and understanding to work with customers of all levels of sophistication. You will communicate with grace and empathy inside and outside of Cloudflare.</p>
<h4>Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Demonstrable experience as a product or program manager shipping desktop and mobile software&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Experience working with operating system APIs, client applications and low level networking is required</li>
	<li>Experience with VPNs, Routing, DNS, Firewalls, Client/Server architectures is required</li>
	<li>An understanding of how client software is deployed in the enterprise is preferred</li>
	<li>Ability to support cross-functional teams in all phases: design, development, pre-sales, piloting and post sales support</li>
	<li>Exceptional people skills, problem-solving and empathy</li>
</ul>
<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
<p>This is a self-directed and highly technical role where you will be expected to own a product vision, direction, and day-to-day growth including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Help contribute to crafting Cloudflare’s vision for the future of the Internet</li>
	<li>Define the product, learn from customer usage, iterate and improve</li>

	<li>Manage a product roadmap and its translation to revenue</li>
	<li>Make decisions and own outcomes</li>
	<li>Work alongside an engineering team to execute on the product vision</li>
