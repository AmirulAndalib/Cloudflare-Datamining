		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><strong>About the Role</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare helps build the future of the Internet. We started Cloudflare to solve one of the largest challenges facing any organization: how do you keep your websites, APIs, services, and infrastructure safe from attack without compromising on performance or reliability? Our customers relied on legacy, painful hardware to solve this challenge. They wanted a scalable service that would work around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To deliver that, we built one of the world's largest networks. Today our network spans more than 250 cities worldwide and is within milliseconds of nearly everyone connected to the Internet. We have built the capacity to stand up to nation-state scale cyberattacks and a threat intelligence system powered by the immense amount of Internet traffic that we see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last five years, Cloudflare has built the next phase of our product journey on top of that network to solve another challenge facing every small team and enterprise on the planet: ensuring the people and teams within an organization can access the tools they need to do their jobs and are safe from data loss and threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do that, we released</span><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/"><strong>Cloudflare Zero Trust</strong></a><strong>, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a platform built on Cloudflare’s network to secure users, devices, and data in organizations of any size. Cloudflare Zero Trust consists of multiple products that deliver a comprehensive solution. Those products include:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/access/"><strong>Cloudflare Access</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, built to replace VPNs and protect internally-managed applications.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/gateway/"><strong>Cloudflare Gateway</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a tool that keeps team members protected from malware and other threats on the Internet.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/"><strong>Cloudflare Tunnel</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the best way to connect your infrastructure to Cloudflare.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://1.1.1.1/"><strong>Cloudflare WARP</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the best way to connect your users to Cloudflare.</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of those products use Cloudflare’s network to secure and accelerate connections, to deliver services closer to the user than other approaches on the market. We have been thrilled with the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-one-year-later/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as their teams start this journey with us, but we need your help to keep building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare Zero Trust relies on our lightweight connector, Cloudflare Tunnel, to easily and securely connect our customers' infrastructure to the Cloudflare Global Network. Our connector runs on all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux) and is one of the few pieces of software at Cloudflare used by administrators and end users alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our connector is also flexible enough to support a variety of use cases whether that be connecting a local HTTP server, web services served by a Kubernetes cluster, or an entire private network segment to Cloudflare. The goal of our connector is not just to create software that is reliable and performant for administrators, but something that is also ridiculously easy to use by any individual around the world.&nbsp;</span></p>

You will work to ensure the connector, which has been deployed on millions of networks, is simple, secure, and performant for all use cases. You will solve problems that have wide impact and significance, shaping the future of connectivity on the Internet.</span></p>

You will need an understanding of networking and familiarity with developing and supporting applications on all major platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux), what deployment of software looks like in all sizes of companies and the ability to help customers troubleshoot complex deployment issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A suitable candidate will have an exceptional understanding of what it takes to build and ship software at scale, customer management, or product, and a deep desire to learn each and every day. As a product that has low level network interactions with all parts of the enterprise stack, candidates will need both technical depth, and empathy and understanding to work with customers of all levels of sophistication. They will communicate with grace and empathy inside and outside of Cloudflare.</span></p>
