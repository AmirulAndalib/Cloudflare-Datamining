<h3>About the Role</h3>
<p>We are looking for an energetic and growth-minded product manager to own Cloudflare Cloud Email Security’s detections &amp; managed services.</p>
<p>In the last couple years, Cloudflare has entered the next phase of our product journey on top of our network to solve another challenge facing every organization on the planet: protecting the people and teams within an organization from the emails that can not only stop them from doing their jobs, but lead to cybersecurity attacks.</p>
<p>Our solution has been Cloud Email Security, which is trusted by companies in the Fortune 100, as well as government organizations, and enterprises around the world. Our solution leverages AI, ML, NLP, and Computer Vision and a swatch of signals to innovatively identify attack patterns and signals for deeper investigation to ultimately prevent phish from staying in inboxes. While the solution has been great at stopping phish, bad actors continue to innovate at breakneck speeds and we need to continue to accelerate our pace as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For detections, this role requires you to develop a deep technical understanding of email, how detections are applied to them, and the internal and external feedback mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the managed services, this role requires you to develop a deep understanding of the UX and the ability to optimize for scale and efficacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both will require an empathic ear for go-to-market teams and customer concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What you'll do</strong></h3>
<p>You’ll be the Product Manager for two parts of the Cloud Email Security product: 1) detections, the system that makes a disposition on emails and their feedback loops 2) managed services, the system used by customers who want Cloudflare to manage their email security. You will lead all efforts related to both parts, directly supporting engineering, sales, product support, and customer success.</p>
<p>In this new role, you shape product and partnerships, working closely with the engineering teams and multiple other functions across Cloudflare to listen to customer problems and expand on our solutions. You’ll ensure that both the detections and managed services UX are best in class, providing valuable bilateral information to other Zero Trust products and our customers. You will solve problems that have wide impact and significance across multiple industries and geographies, shaping the future of security on the Internet.</p>
<p>To be successful in this role, you will need an understanding of email, security best practices, and analytics and reporting. Familiarity with what full stack engineering is, workflow optimization, and experience building self-service applications are important.</p>

	<li>Demonstrated ability to lead, drive consensus and deliver in an organization with multiple internal and external stakeholders</li>
	<li>Exceptional empathy, curiosity, attention to detail, and problem solving abilities</li>
	<li>Experience partnering closely with Product Design to deliver engaging user experiences</li>
	<li>Excellent communication, presentation, organizational and analytical skills</li>
	<li>Manage product releases in close collaboration with engineering and security teams</li>
	<li>Manage product pricing for managed services</li>
	<li>Engage with customers for product adoption and future direction and manage the product roadmap</li>
	<li>Familiarity with modern software development practices used to build and deploy applications</li>

</ul>
<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
