<h4><strong>About the Department</strong></h4>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you are responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare sit at the intersection of software development, design, and business strategy. We shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, create a launch plan with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation. We have ultimate responsibility for understanding our client needs, influencing business strategy, feature specification, and working with engineering to develop our software.</p>
<h4><strong>About The Team</strong></h4>
<p>The Content Delivery group aims to help make the Internet faster, safer and more secure through building and optimizing one of the world’s largest CDNs in addition to driving adoption of new standards.&nbsp; This involves feature implementation, optimization, debugging, working with responsible teams and engineers, documentation and tooling to enable others.</p>
