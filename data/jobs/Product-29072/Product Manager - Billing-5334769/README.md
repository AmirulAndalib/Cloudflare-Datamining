<h4>About the Department</h4>
<p>As a Product Manager (PM) at Cloudflare, you are responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare sit at the intersection of engineering, design, and business strategy. We shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, execute a launch plan with marketing, conduct user research with designers, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation. We have ultimate responsibility for understanding our client needs, influencing business strategy, defining feature specification, and working with engineering to develop our software.</p>
<h4>About the Role</h4>
<p>Billing is a critical part of the product &amp; engineering organization, fulfilling needs from marketing, sales, finance, customer support, business intelligence and legal teams.&nbsp; As a PM in Billing, you will help scale the platform and create a frictionless experience for our “pay as you go” and contracted customers.&nbsp; You will have an impact on how customers make payments while providing visibility and transparency to their bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll also work to satisfy needs from internal stakeholders and unblock teams as we strive to ship new products and features quickly.&nbsp; We are always looking to identify new monetization opportunities so you will be working closely with sales, marketing and product teams to support business growth.</p>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility. To elaborate on those:</p>

	<li>Author use cases and prioritize requirements. Translate market observations and customer feedback into a prioritized product backlog.&nbsp; Author use cases based on specific real-world product applications and extrapolate detailed product requirements for the scenarios.</li>
	<li>Collaborate across teams. We win or lose as a team. Product managers play a critical role in creating alignment between engineering teams and stakeholders. A collaborative attitude is essential to the job.</li>
	<li>Measure success. Own the measures used to define success for your product. Success measures must be defined at the inception of a product and tracked throughout its lifecycle. Make measures visible to all stakeholders and interpret them into actionable conclusions and new hypotheses.</li>
	<li>Develop new opportunities. With your finger on the pulse of the market, the customers and the engineering teams, you are uniquely positioned to discover and develop new opportunities.</li>
</ul>
