<p><strong>About the role.</strong></p>
<p>Cloudflare is looking for a bright, proactive and detail-oriented Administrative Assistant to support three executives in the organization: the VP of Product Management (to whom this role reports), VP of Product Engineering, and the Senior Director of Special Projects / Head of London Office.</p>
<p>Your job is to keep these leaders organized, prioritized and productive while we grow the business. This role requires superior attention to detail, great organizational skills, and the ability to juggle multiple high-priority requests. It also requires the ability to work with team members at all levels, sometimes under pressure. A high level of integrity and discretion in handling confidential information is important, as is a positive attitude. The ideal candidate is a seasoned administrative assistant who can cultivate great working relationships, communicate directly, and organize around a common goal. The candidate must be based in the London, UK area.</p>
<p><strong>What you'll do.</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Admin: Provide excellent administrative support, exercising high attention to detail and discretion to every matter.

	<li>Project Management: Assist team projects on an ad-hoc basis. This may include documentation on internal meetings, gathering information, and formalizing plans of action.</li>
	<li>Calendar: Proactively own and flawlessly execute on calendars, prioritizing with purpose, deflecting with tact, and understanding both the short- and long-term impacts of each confirmed, declined, and rescheduled meeting. Ensure the leaders are equipped with all the necessary meeting information and manage inbound and outbound requests. If you enjoy “playing Tetris” with different time zones and schedules to help people get together, that would be a plus!</li>
	<li>Travel and Expenses: Plan all aspects of domestic and international travel, optimizing and balancing executives’ time with cost of travel; monitoring flights for up to the minute changes; ensuring all documents are secured and up-to-date. Ensure timely submission of expense reports through Navan.</li>
	<li>Admin Team: Our admin team has a high degree of camaraderie and the ideal candidate will enjoy partnering closely with their peers and foster teamwork.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Exhibits a strong work ethic, professionalism, confidentiality, empathy towards others, and good judgment</li>
	<li>Incredibly organized and resourceful, able to juggle and multi-task with acute attention to detail and follow through</li>
	<li>Personable with a can-do attitude that sees no task or project to be too small or too big</li>
</ul>
