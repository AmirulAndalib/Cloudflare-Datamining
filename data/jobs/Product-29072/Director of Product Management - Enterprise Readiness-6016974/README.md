<h4><strong>About the Role</strong></h4>
<p>As the product leader of the Enterprise Readiness team you will take ownership of how customers manage Cloudflare for their organizations, manage team and user access, and how customers interact with our API services. You will be responsible for building the necessary capabilities to enable the company to scale to meet the needs of the largest enterprises in the world, so that they can successfully adopt Cloudflare across their organization. Problems you may face:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>How do we enable customers to scale from a few teams using Cloudflare to entire departments across the company and across subsidiaries? How can they manage that transition easily, while maintaining visibility into their Cloudflare environment?</li>
	<li>How do we ensure partners and resellers are treated as first class in their ability to manage Cloudflare at scale and quickly get their end customers up and running on the platform?</li>
	<li>For teams using Cloudflare, how do we provide necessary security capabilities, like SSO, SCIM, and least privileged access controls, so that they can properly secure access to Cloudflare?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>How do we allow customers using SDKs, like Terraform, a consistent and complete experience so they can adopt and manage products the way they want to?</li>
	<li>How do we ensure that the platform is highly available and performant so customers can trust us to be there when they need us?</li>
	<li>How do we provide all these platform capabilities while ensuring product teams can maintain their focus on delivering what customers need by quickly adopting these platform capabilities?</li>
</ul>
<p>As Director of Product Management, Enterprise Readiness, you’ll be responsible for leading a team of PMs who partner with a committed set of engineering, design, and go-to-market teams as well as product teams from around the company to meet these challenges. At the same time, you’ll be expected to establish and maintain a high performance culture in your team and contribute to citizenship at Cloudflare - promoting excellence and elevation of the craft of Product Management across the company.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Key Competencies</strong></h4>
<p>In this role, you’ll be responsible for building and iterating existing products and delivering brand-new. We want to find someone who is curious, can learn quickly, think creatively, and work cross-functionally with engineering, design and other teams. A few key competencies:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Demonstrated excellence building customer management and platform experiences in an Enterprise setting. Be prepared to show examples of your work, ideally live.</li>
	<li>Experience in wrangling system and domain complexity to present delightful experiences for customers.</li>
	<li>A history of building and managing teams where people deliver the best work of their lives in a dynamic environment where goals can conflict and desires always exceed resources</li>
	<li>First-class execution - we want to understand the system by which you manage competing priorities, progress never stops and the right things get done.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Excellent synthesis abilities - you will not be handed a graph to move. You will be asked to talk to numerous constituents and then define the graph that needs to move, convince everyone else it is the right graph, then move it - iteratively, continuously, tirelessly.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Influence through persuasion - you need to convince teams that do not work for you to see things your way. Your communication skills and EQ will need to be excellent.&nbsp; You’re able to speak with ease to customers, engineers, colleagues and executives</li>
	<li>A track-record of driving excellence throughout the organizations you serve. We want to hear not just about the things you shipped but the difficult cases where you had to say no.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Bonus Points</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>An ability to hold your own with engineers - you don’t need a software engineering background but you’re going to be spending a lot of time with engineers (both within Cloudflare and as customers) so some direct fluency with code is ideal. Familiarity with authentication and access control systems is ideal.</li>
	<li>Data-fluency - there is no team of analysts at Cloudflare. Can you work directly with data yourself to build confidence in your views and can you use that same data to persuade others?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Compensation may be adjusted depending on work location.</p>
