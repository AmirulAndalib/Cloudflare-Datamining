<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you are responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare sit at the intersection of software development, design, and business strategy. We shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, create a launch plan with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation. We have ultimate responsibility for understanding our client needs, influencing business strategy, feature specification, and working with engineering to develop our software.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>We are hiring a PM to help build products that enable customers to transform their corporate network.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Cloudflare provides a full stack of networking-as-a-service products that allow customers to build and operate secure, reliable, and fast networks without purchasing traditional network hardware. Cloudflare’s network underpins mission-critical infrastructure, always-on applications, small businesses, and everything in between. Our customers rely on the performance, security, reliability, and visibility provided by our network to power their business.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>We’re looking for a PM to define and execute on the vision to replace “next generation” network firewalls with a modern, network-as-a-service offering leveraging the full power and threat data of the Cloudflare network. Traditional network firewalls, and their virtualized equivalents, all suffer from the same scale, cost, and administration challenges of other network hardware that Cloudflare replaces. It’s time to build a better solution and reinvent the market.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>As Product Manager for Magic Firewall, your job will be to:</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Ensure customers are able to easily analyze and secure network traffic to and from any network location—whether on the Internet or across the corporate environment.</li>
	<li>Build innovative solutions to customers’ network security problems that leverage the unique strengths of Cloudflare: a massive, highly interconnected network spanning the world, threat intelligence distilled from an unparalleled vantage point on the Internet, and a high-velocity engineering organization that ships early and often.</li>
	<li>Harness cutting edge machine learning (ML) and big data analysis techniques to build solutions that detect and mitigate network security threats with minimal customer involvement.</li>
	<li>Think through how to make a great, easy-to-use product that customers love, and drive the full product life cycle from core user needs discovery through to pricing and packaging. Ship continuous software and process improvements to support your products’ sustained growth.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>As a member of the growing team of product managers your responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Own the product vision for your area. Ensure that it aligns with the overall product and company vision.</li>
	<li>Represent the customer. Be the champion and voice of customers. Build intimate, personal customer relationships. Bring the customer's voice into the creation process.</li>
	<li>Manage the roadmap. Make tough tactical prioritization decisions while helping the company think long-term. Build trust with stakeholders by maintaining an understandable, accurate roadmap.</li>
	<li>Author use cases and prioritize requirements. Translate market observations and customer feedback into a prioritized product backlog. Author use cases based on specific real-world product applications and extrapolate detailed product requirements for the scenarios.</li>
	<li>Collaborate across teams. We win or lose as a team. Product managers play a critical role in creating alignment between engineering teams and other stakeholders. A collaborative attitude is essential to the job.</li>
	<li>Measure success. Own the measures used to define success for your product. Success measures must be defined at the inception of a product and tracked throughout its lifecycle. Make measures visible to all stakeholders and interpret them into actionable conclusions and new hypotheses.</li>
	<li>Develop new opportunities. With your finger on the pulse of the market, the customers and the engineering teams, you are uniquely positioned to bring new products to market that solve real customer problems.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
