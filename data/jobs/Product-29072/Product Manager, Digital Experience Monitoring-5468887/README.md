<h4>About the Role</h4>
<p>Cloudflare helps build the future of the Internet. We started Cloudflare to solve one of the largest challenges facing any organization: how do you keep your websites, APIs, services, and infrastructure safe from attack without compromising on performance or reliability? Our customers relied on legacy, painful hardware to solve this challenge. They wanted a scalable service that would work around the world.</p>
<p>To deliver that, we built one of the world's largest networks. Today our network spans more than 250 cities worldwide and is within milliseconds of nearly everyone connected to the Internet. We have built the capacity to stand up to nation-state scale cyberattacks and a threat intelligence system powered by the immense amount of Internet traffic that we see.</p>
<p>In the last five years, Cloudflare has built the next phase of our product journey, <strong>Cloudflare Zero Trust</strong>, on top of that network to solve another challenge: ensuring the people and teams within an organization can access the tools they need to do their jobs and are safe from data loss and threats.</p>
