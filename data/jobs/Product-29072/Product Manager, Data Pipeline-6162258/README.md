<h2>About Product Management at Cloudflare</h2>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you will be responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, collaborate with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Data product team is a growing, tight-knit team of empowered PMs with deep technical knowledge about data, analytics, and logs. We are a highly empathetic team who care deeply about our business, our customers, and our team members.</p>
<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>As the Product Manager for the Data Pipeline, your primary goal is to support and grow the backend data platform at Cloudflare, which allows us to expose powerful Analytics and Logs products to customers. You’ll work closely with a strong team of Engineers on data problems at unparalleled scale. In short, this job is about understanding the data needs of our internal and external customers and the business, and partnering with your team to deliver solutions that are valuable and viable.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Among other things you’ll be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The resilience of our data infrastructure, ensuring that our data systems scale reliably with the growth of our data volume.</li>
	<li>The quality of the data that flows through our systems, ensuring good governance and hygiene across all systems.</li>
	<li>Working cross-functionally to understand the data growth needs of our internal customers, and collaborate with our engineering team on the best ways to meet those needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Competencies</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Deep technical expertise with data products at scale: For this role we need someone who has a technical background in data warehousing and data pipelines at scale. You are comfortable with accessing and querying large data sets directly. You have built and grown pipelines where data throughput growth is upwards of 70% YoY.</li>
	<li>Customer Engagement: Engage directly with customers (internal and external) to deeply understand their needs. You will be the voice of the customer within Cloudflare, ensuring that our data and analytics products are continuously evolving to meet their needs.</li>
	<li>Market Understanding: Keep up to date on industry trends and competitor activities to ensure Cloudflare remains a leader in cloud connectivity and security.</li>
	<li>Product Strategy and Vision: Define and drive the strategic direction for Cloudflare's data pipeline products, aligning with broader company objectives and customer needs.</li>
	<li>Cross-Functional Partnership: Collaborate with engineering, design, marketing, sales, and support teams to understand user and business needs, and deliver a product experience that is valuable and viable.</li>
	<li>Data-Informed Decision Making: Use data analytics to inform product decisions and measure the impact of new features and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Bonus Points</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Understanding the modern UX stack with enough fidelity to hold your own with engineers will be highly beneficial. An engineering background would be helpful. An alternate source of credibility on this front might come from having developed a web property yourself.</li>
	<li>Data-fluency. Can you work directly with data yourself to build confidence in your views and can you use that same data to persuade others?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
