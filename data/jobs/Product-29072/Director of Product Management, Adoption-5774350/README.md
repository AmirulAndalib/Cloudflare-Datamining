		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Available Locations: </strong>Hybrid -<strong> </strong><span class="collapsed-field-text">Austin, San Francisco,</span>&nbsp;Remote - US</p>
<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>As the product leader of the Adoption team you will take ownership of the Cloudflare dashboard and cloudflare.com. You will measure and grow the engagement of customers and prospects with our products and with Cloudflare itself. Problems you may face:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>How can cloudflare.com do better at educating prospects about Cloudflare products and our mission to build a better Internet? How do we measure progress?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>How can the dashboard provide individual product teams a powerful canvas on which to deliver world-class experiences? Can we maintain a tech stack and common design language that empowers individual teams to build great experiences rather than constrain them?</li>
	<li>Can we simultaneously educate customers about our products, convince them to pay, then onboard and upsell them to new offerings as well as encourage them to onboard their colleagues and friends?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Can we manage adjacent cost drivers like customer support and outbound sales? Can we be confident that moving the needle on these fronts is doing more good than harm? Can we leverage adjacent channels like cloudflare.tv and social media?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Many customers interact with Cloudflare predominantly through APIs or Terraform. How can these properties serve the needs of those customers as well while maintaining velocity of innovation?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>As Director of Product Management, Adoption, you’ll be responsible for leading a small team of PMs who partner with a committed set of engineering, design, and go-to-market teams as well as product teams from around the company to meet these challenges. At the same time, you’ll be expected to establish and maintain a high performance culture in your team and contribute to citizenship at Cloudflare - promoting excellence and elevation of the craft of Product Management across the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key Competencies</strong></p>
<p>In this role, you’ll be responsible for building and iterating existing products and delivering brand-new. We want to find someone who is curious, can learn quickly, think creatively, and work cross-functionally with engineering, design and other teams. A few key competencies:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Demonstrated excellence building public facing UX in an Enterprise setting. Be prepared to show examples of your work, ideally live.</li>
	<li>A history of building and managing teams where people deliver the best work of their lives in a dynamic environment where goals can conflict and desires always exceed resources</li>
	<li>First-class execution - we want to understand the system by which you manage competing priorities, progress never stops and the right things get done.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Excellent synthesis abilities - you will not be handed a graph to move. You will be asked to talk to numerous constituents and then define the graph that needs to move, convince everyone else it is the right graph, then move it - iteratively, continuously, tirelessly.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Influence through persuasion - you need to convince teams that do not work for you to see things your way. Your communication skills and EQ will need to be excellent.&nbsp; You’re able to speak with ease to customers, engineers, colleagues and executives</li>
	<li>A track-record of driving excellence throughout the organizations you serve. We want to hear not just about the things you shipped but the difficult cases where you had to say no.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Understanding the modern UX stack with enough fidelity to hold your own with engineers will be highly beneficial. An engineering background would be helpful. An alternate source of credibility on this front might come from having developed a web property yourself.</li>
	<li>Data-fluency - there is no team of analysts at Cloudflare. Can you work directly with data yourself to build confidence in your views and can you use that same data to persuade others?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Compensation may be adjusted depending on work location.</p>
