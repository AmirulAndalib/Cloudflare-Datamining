		<p>At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

<h2>About Product Management at Cloudflare</h2>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you will be responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, collaborate with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation.</p>
<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>As the Product Manager for Logs, your primary responsibility is to support and grow the Logs Platform at Cloudflare, which allows us to expose powerful Logs products to customers. You’ll work closely with a strong team of Engineers on data problems at unparalleled scale. In short, this job is about understanding the data &amp; logs needs of our internal and external customers and the business, and partnering with your team to deliver solutions that are valuable and viable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Among other things you’ll be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The reliability of log data flowing out of the Cloudflare system into customer owned data buckets and SIEMs.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The scalability of our data infrastructure, ensuring that our logs systems scale reliably with the growth of our logs volume.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The coverage and accuracy of our customer facing Audit Logs system, ensuring that it complies with industry standards.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Enabling internal teams to easily integrate with our logs products to power a variety of logs experiences for our customers, in order to reduce the developmental burden on other teams.</li>
	<li>Having strong, informed opinions and suggestions about <em>how</em> internal teams can best use our data infrastructure to power customer-facing logs products.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Competencies</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Customer Engagement: Engage directly with customers (internal and external) to deeply understand their needs. You will be the voice of the customer within Cloudflare, ensuring that our logs products are continuously evolving to meet their needs.</li>
	<li>Market Understanding: Keep up to date on industry trends and competitor activities to ensure Cloudflare remains a leader in cloud connectivity and security.</li>
	<li>Product Strategy and Vision: Define and drive the strategic direction for Cloudflare's logs products, aligning with broader company objectives and customer needs.</li>
	<li>Cross-Functional Partnership: Collaborate with engineering, design, marketing, sales, and support teams to understand user and business needs, and deliver a product experience that is valuable and viable.</li>
	<li>Data-Informed Decision Making: Use data analytics to inform product decisions and measure the impact of new features and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Points</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Understanding the modern UX stack with enough fidelity to hold your own with engineers will be highly beneficial. An engineering background would be helpful. An alternate source of credibility on this front might come from having developed a web property yourself.</li>
	<li>Data-fluency - there is no team of analysts at Cloudflare. Can you work directly with data yourself to build confidence in your views and can you use that same data to persuade others?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
