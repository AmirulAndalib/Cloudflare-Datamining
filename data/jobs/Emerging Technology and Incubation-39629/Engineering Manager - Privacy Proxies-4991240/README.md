	<div>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>About the department</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging Technologies &amp; Incubation (ETI) is where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a massively successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare’s edge and network make it possible to solve problems at massive scale and efficiency which would be impossible for almost any other organization.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What you'll do</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for an Engineering Manager to join our team. You will lead a team of passionate, talented engineers that are building innovative products that bring privacy, security and speed to millions of internet users each day. You will play an active part in shaping product strategy based on what’s technically possible. You will make sure our company hits our ambitious goals from an engineering standpoint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team you will lead currently works on a </span><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-oxy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">next-generation proxy framework</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> written in Rust. The framework is the foundation for mission-critical products at Cloudflare, such as the </span><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Trust Gateway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and our </span><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-servers-dont-own-ips-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">egress routing service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and for a collection of</span><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Privacy proxies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the team develops and operates. There is also collaboration with our research team in, for example, building privacy-preserving measurement and analytics systems based on emerging cryptographic standards.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this role, you will manage and lead those projects, working directly with internal teams or external partners such as browser and operating system vendors, </span><strong>with a mission to improve the state of privacy and security on the web</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You will manage multiple services at scale, ensuring that the team is capable of responding to or preventing incidents in a timely manner, with the right alerts and metrics in place. You will lead the implementation of new feature requests with often competing priorities coming from our internal and external partners alike, while maintaining clear and proactive communication of progress, changes, and blockers to all internal and external stakeholders.</span></p>
