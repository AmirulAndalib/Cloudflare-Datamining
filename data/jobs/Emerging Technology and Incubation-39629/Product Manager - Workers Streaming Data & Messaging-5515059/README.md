We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that.

<p><strong>About The Role</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be responsible for driving the future of streaming data, ingestion and messaging as part of the <a href="https://workers.dev/">Cloudflare Workers</a> platform, which enables developers to build reliable, highly distributed services without having to be distributed systems experts themselves.</p>
<p>This includes helping define new products that allow developers to more easily ingest and transform data into <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/">R2</a>, our object storage service; as well as grow <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/">Queues</a>, our globally distributed, async task processing service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key part of this role is exploring (and shipping) the future products developers need to operate on data coming into and out of our storage products.</p>
<p>You’ll be singularly responsible for the future direction of our data ingestion products, including engaging with developers from companies of all sizes to ensure we’re building accessible products with an approachable developer experience.</p>
<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>
<p>We announced Cloudflare Workers in 2017&nbsp; — since then it’s played a key role in Cloudflare’s strategy for entering the compute market. Until the launch of Workers, as Cloudflare was ramping up its capabilities in the performance and security spaces, it became clear that developers needed more ways to control the edge than rules engines could support.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Workers has grown from a simple functions-as-a-service option into a fully blown full-stack platform. With any application, however, in addition to serverless compute, you need to be able to manage state and connect to data you already have.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Drive the strategy, roadmap &amp; represent your products across the organization</li>
	<li>Lead projects from ideation through launch, and continuing through ongoing maintenance and support</li>
	<li>Develop and nurture relationships with engineering and coordinate closely to ensure successful delivery of product</li>
	<li>Partner with other departments such as Product Marketing, Marketing, Community &amp; developer advocacy, Sales, and Customer Support to drive adoption and gather feedback from customers and prospects</li>
	<li>Ruthlessly prioritize across a complex environment of diverse customers, stakeholders and objectives</li>
	<li>Represent the company externally as needed, including meetings with customers and prospects and analysis</li>
	<li>Delve into market research to drive new investments opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples Of Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience</strong></p>
<p>The ideal candidate is entrepreneurial-minded and thrives in a fast-paced and goal-driven environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have outstanding communication and collaboration skills and are able to work with a diverse group, get alignment, and drive the product forward. You are execution focused and emphasize getting things done while paying attention to important details.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Proven track record of shipping developer-facing products from ideation to launch</li>
	<li>Experience distilling complex topics into easily understood written documents for stakeholders across levels and functions.</li>
	<li>Experience with streaming data services and/or data workflow products, such as Kafka, Apache Beam or Pulsar, Temporal, or AWS Kinesis Firehose.</li>
	<li>Developer focus — you’ll be working directly, and often be a part of the customers team in helping them get their initial implementation off the ground</li>
	<li>BS/MS in a technology field.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Professional product management experience (3 - 5 years)</li>
	<li>Strong technical abilities. You are intimately familiar with modern software development practices used to build and deploy applications. You are capable of wading into the details &amp; understanding engineering decisions’ impact on the product, but can also drive 30k foot view</li>
	<li>A desire to sweat the details and ship great developer experiences</li>
	<li>Experience using developer tools (such as source-control management tools, CLIs, etc)</li>
	<li>A love for talking to developers at organizations both large and small on a daily basis so that you can build and ship products that solve real problems.</li>
	<li>Scripting/programming experience (Javascript, Rust, Go, etc.) and/or experience with using Cloudflare Workers or other serverless runtimes are considered a significant bonus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compensation may be adjusted depending on work location.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For Colorado-based hires and Washington hires: Estimated annual salary of $168,000 - $206,000.<br>For New York City-based and California (excluding Bay Area): Estimated annual salary of $187,000 - $229,000.<br>For Bay Area-based hires: Estimated annual salary of $196,000 - $224,000</li>
