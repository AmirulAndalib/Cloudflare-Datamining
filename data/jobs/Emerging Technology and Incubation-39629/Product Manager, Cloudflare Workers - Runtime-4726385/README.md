<p><strong>About The Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We announced Cloudflare Workers in 2017&nbsp; —&nbsp;since then it’s played a key role in Cloudflare’s strategy for entering the compute market. Until the launch of Workers, as Cloudflare was ramping up its capabilities in the performance and security spaces, it became clear that developers needed more ways to control the edge than rules engines could support. Workers has allowed Cloudflare to add programmability to the edge such that developers could have access to writing logic on the edge in their preferred way — through code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, Workers has grown from a simple functions-as-a-service option into a fully blown full-stack platform, with storage options (KV, Durable Objects), and a rich suite of tools to support it. However, we believe we’re still just getting started. The foundation of everything we build is the Workers runtime. It’s what we build so many of our own products on. It’s also what we view as the future of JavaScript runtimes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this role, you’ll be helping define the future of the runtime, making sure we’re focused on the highest priority projects.</span></p>
