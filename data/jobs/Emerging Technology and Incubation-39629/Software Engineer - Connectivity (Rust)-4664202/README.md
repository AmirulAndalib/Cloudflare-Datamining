	<div>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging Technologies &amp; Incubation (ETI) is where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a massively successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><strong>About The Team</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Connectivity team is launching the Zero Trust SIM and the Internet of Things platform. The Internet of Things (IoT) devices represent somewhere in the order of double the number of smartphones connected to the Internet today — and unlike smartphones, this number is expected to continue to grow tremendously, since they aren’t bound to the number of humans that can carry them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This exponential growth in devices has brought with it an explosion in risk. We’ve been defending against DDoS attacks from Internet of Things (IoT) driven botnets like </span><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/mirai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/meris-botnet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for years now. They keep </span><a href="https://www.securityweek.com/cloudflare-mitigates-2-tbps-ddos-attack-launched-mirai-botnet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because securing IoT devices still remains challenging, and manufacturers are often not incentivized to secure them. In true Cloudflare fashion, we think that combining the software layer and the network layer enables better security, performance, and reliability. By targeting a foundational piece of technology that underpins every mobile device — the (not so) humble </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIM card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — we’re aiming to bring an unprecedented level of security (and performance) to the mobile world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our opportunity is both huge and unique. This team will have a say in the roadmap and design of our product, which is still in its early days, help with research and build the necessary software to run it.</span></p>
