	<div>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Position Location: Austin, TX | Lisbon, Portugal | London, UK</strong></p>
<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>Our team’s core mission is to enable developers to do what they do best — build powerful applications.&nbsp; We believe they should be able to do this without having to think or worry about infrastructure, scaling, or performance. While Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare’s solution to serverless computing, handles the infrastructure part, there’s so much more that goes into enabling developers to do their jobs. In this role you will work on a wide range of projects that enable our platform to integrate seamlessly with the existing Web development ecosystem, including developing and improving integration with full stack web frameworks, developer tools for bundling, transpiling, and performance optimizations. You’ll also be exposed to JS API design and standardization work, and development or integration of backwards/forwards compatibility API layers for Web and Node.js APIs. If this excites you, come join our team of talented engineers that enables developers all around the world to build low-latency planet-scale applications for the Internet and the Web!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About the Department</strong></p>
<p>Our team Frameworks and ecosystem is part of Cloudflare's Emerging Technology and Incubation (ETI) team where new, bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a successful business, ETI leverages our network to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Our most successful endeavors include the Cloudflare development platform, which is composed of Cloudflare Workers, Pages, R2, D1, and many other developer products.</p>
<p><strong>What you'll do</strong></p>
<p>As a member of the Frameworks &amp; JS APIs team, you will put yourself in the shoes of developers using our development platform and make them successful in building their applications and deploying them on to our platform by creating and improving integrations with popular web frameworks, libraries, and tools. Along the way you’ll influence the JavaScript ecosystem by participating in designing JavaScript APIs, defining design patterns and architectures, as well as surfacing optimizations, that allow developers to build applications that take full advantage of our globally distributed, low latency network.</p>
<p><strong>To this end, you will:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Collaborate closely with JavaScript web frameworks teams and tooling teams across the industry to ensure smooth development and production interoperability with our platform. Examples include Angular, Astro, Next, Nuxt, Qwik, Remix, Solid, SvelteKit, as well as Vite, Rollup, and many others.</li>
	<li>Surface requirements and collaborate with internal teams to build features to support ecosystem integrations.</li>
	<li>Contribute to open source projects across the web ecosystem in order to add features, fix issues, and improve integrations.</li>
	<li>Build and improve libraries, and tools that improve ecosystem compatibility, and the getting started experience, like C3 (create-cloudflare CLI) and next-on-pages CLI.</li>
	<li>Build demo applications, starter kits, and templates that enable developers to learn about our platform and get started using frameworks and libraries they are familiar with.</li>
	<li>Participate in JavaScript API design efforts evolving our platform, as well as JavaScript standards.</li>
	<li>Evaluate compatibility gaps between our workerd JavaScript runtime and Node.js, implement compatibility layers and polyfills to reduce developer friction when using existing libraries with our platform.</li>
	<li>Contribute to internal and public-facing technical documentation, and author blog posts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If applicable to ongoing projects, support the health and availability of services by being part of an on-call rotation.</li>
	<li>Collaborate with engineers across Cloudflare, and contribute at many layers of the stack.</li>
	<li>Leverage your creativity and developer prowess to seek out new ways to improve the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About you</strong></p>
<p><strong>We want you to love it here! This role is a good fit for you if you are:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Excited by the idea of helping application developers be successful.</li>
	<li>Experienced with and passionate about development tools, libraries, frameworks, and workflows.</li>
	<li>Experienced in web application development, but attracted to digging a layer or two below to work on libraries, frameworks, and tools that power web application development.</li>
	<li>Very experienced with JavaScript and TypeScript, web standards, JavaScript module systems, module resolution, code transformation, ASTs, and more.</li>
	<li>Able to get familiar with internal architecture and workings of libraries and tools quickly, in order to propose integration strategies, or architectural adjustments.</li>
	<li>Energized by mind-bending debugging sessions often involving unfamiliar code bases, complex build toolchains, and exotic bugs.</li>
	<li>Excited to own your work from early discussions on.</li>
	<li>Naturally curious and eager to take a step to learn something new, and share your learnings with others.</li>
	<li>Above all, a collaborator and effective communicator. You want to join a team that upholds a culture of support, open and honest communication, and vulnerability, and that values collaboration over heroism. We celebrate our achievements, support each other when we make mistakes, and hold each other and our work to the highest standard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You’ll really feel right at home if you have:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Experience using the Cloudflare Workers development platform</li>
	<li>Experience contributing to OSS software development or maintaining OSS projects</li>
	<li>Public speaking or developer relations skills</li>
</ul>
