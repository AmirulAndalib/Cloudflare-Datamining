	<div>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>About The Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We announced Cloudflare Workers in 2017&nbsp; — since then it’s played a key role in Cloudflare’s strategy for entering the compute market. Until the launch of Workers, as Cloudflare was ramping up its capabilities in the performance and security spaces, it became clear that developers needed more ways to control the edge than rules engines could support. Workers has allowed Cloudflare to add programmability to the edge such that developers could have access to writing logic on the edge in their preferred way — through code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, Workers has grown from a simple functions-as-a-service option into a fully blown full-stack platform. With any application, however, in addition to serverless compute, you need to be able to manage state. =</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Cloudflare released D1 — built on Durable Objects, D1 is Cloudflare’s first foray into providing a managed database solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this role, you’ll be helping define and build the future of D1, making sure we’re focused on the highest priority projects to enable developers to build full stack applications.&nbsp;</span></p>
