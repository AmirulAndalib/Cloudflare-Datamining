								"shortDescription": "Using Cloudflare as a single network entry point for its global operations, Delivery Hero reduced complexity, enhanced global network performance, and secured its international workforce and websites",
								"longDescription": "## __Delivery Hero secures its global workforce in 70+ countries with Cloudflare__\n\n[Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com/) is on a mission \"to deliver anything, straight to customers' doors.\" Today, the company is the world's leading local delivery platform, connecting customers in over 70 countries across four continents with an ecosystem of restaurants, shops, retail partners, and 'Dmarts,' its self-branded, delivery-only supermarkets. \n\nThe company manages a portfolio of international and regional brands like [efood](https://www.e-food.gr/), [foodora](https://www.foodora.com/), [foodpanda](https://www.foodpanda.com/), [foody](https://www.foody.com.cy), [Glovo](https://glovoapp.com/), [HungerStation](https://hungerstation.com/), [PedidosYa](https://www.pedidosya.com/), [talabat](https://www.talabat.com/) and [Yemeksepeti](https://www.yemeksepeti.com/), and is also a global pioneer of q-commerce — online sales and ultra-fast logistics services that deliver goods in under an hour.  \n\nFounded in 2011 in Berlin with an initial team of 10, Delivery Hero now hires employees across 4 continents, in over 70+ countries and has been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 2017.\n\n### __Challenge: Rising IT & security complexity driven by rapid growth__\n\nFor Delivery Hero, rapid growth had introduced complexities and challenges for its IT and security approach. Between 2016 and 2020, the company grew its workforce from ~9,000 to ~30,000 employees, and over that time, expanded their global reach through various strategic mergers and acquisitions. Keeping pace with onboarding new users and integrating new companies with different tech stacks was increasingly taxing for Delivery Hero's internal teams.\n\n\"With so many different new people and infrastructures to manage, the complexity added up,\" explains Wilson Tang, Director of Engineering, Platform Core Services at Delivery Hero. \"That limited how efficiently we could innovate. To move quickly, we needed tools to help us get that complexity under control.\" \n\nThe shift to remote work in 2020 placed even greater demands on security, forcing Delivery Hero to manage an expanded [attack surface](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-an-attack-surface/) and stay vigilant against a rise in cyber threats. Ensuring safe and productive access for employees to internal resources became a top priority.\n\n\"When we adopted work-from-home and hybrid work models around the world, we needed to protect applications designed for access only on our internal office networks,\" says Tang. \"Securing everything and giving employees access from home, or anywhere else they chose to work, became much more challenging and complex.\"\n\nTo tame this complexity, Delivery Hero has adopted [Cloudflare's connectivity cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/), which converges many services companies need to secure and protect their digital environments. Specifically, Delivery Hero has progressively consolidated more security, performance, and developer functionality, onto Cloudflare's control plane, including:\n\n- Securing access to internal resources with Zero Trust\n- Improving security and performance across public-facing apps and websites\n- Streamlining the development and configuration of apps\n\n\"Cloudflare's connectivity cloud is helping us manage complexity across our global operations and has made our lives so much easier,\" says Tang.  \n\n### __Securing internal access to support hybrid work__ \n\nDelivery Hero, which had always prioritized cloud-native security tools, first turned to Cloudflare to secure access to internal applications. Specifically, Tang and his team began evaluating Cloudflare One, a [Security Services Edge (SSE)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/security-service-edge-sse/) platform that includes a [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/) service to secure remote access. \n\nPreviously, Delivery Hero had relied on a VPN solution, but had found the technology inefficient to manage and slow for end users. In testing Cloudflare, they focused first on applying identity-based checks for web apps – a common initial use case that does not require deploying any device client software.\n\n\"From the beginning, Cloudflare impressed us with its ease and speed of deployment,\" says Tang. \"Protecting an application takes maybe five minutes, and I can skip the pain points of setting up access with traditional VPNs.\"\n\nOver time, the company has scaled its deployment across more users and more applications, including key developer tools and backend customer systems. Today, Delivery Hero uses Cloudflare to secure access for over 40,000 employees to all applications across self-hosted, SaaS, and non-web environments. Enforcing [single sign-on](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sso/) identity checks has helped Delivery Hero both improve its security posture with [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/) best practices and streamline the experience for end users.\n\n\"With Cloudflare, our employees can access the tools they need to get their jobs done without extra security hassle or connectivity issues,\" says Tang. \n\nAdopting Cloudflare has helped Delivery Hero scale more efficiently by simplifying the process of onboarding new employees and consolidating access policies on a single platform. This has freed up time and energy for Delivery Hero's technical staff to focus on innovation rather than administration.\n\n\"Being able to onboard new teams quickly and easily shift our new brands onto a consolidated, easily administered platform like Cloudflare improved our efficiency and time-to-market with new products,\" says Tang. \"Speed of innovation is everything in the tech industry, and by simplifying operations using Cloudflare we can iterate and create service and value improvements that keep our customers from turning to our competitors.\"\n\n### __Securing and improving performance of public-facing websites__ \n\nAfter simplifying its security approach for internal resources, Delivery Hero began a similar process for security across its public-facing resources, which include websites, desktop and mobile customer apps, and vendor-facing administrative portals. \n\nWith its large online footprint and high volume of transactions processed, Delivery Hero has consistently been an attractive target for attackers, particularly as the company has grown. These attacks risked eroding customer trust, and mitigating them took time and energy away from staff.\n\n\"We faced every type of attack you can imagine,\" says Tang. \"DDoS attacks and bots brute forcing our endpoints, and deliberate, for-profit credential stuffing, account takeovers, and voucher, identity, and credit card fraud attempts against our customer and vendor portals.\" \n\nTo address these risks, Delivery Hero has secured all its public-facing apps and websites with Cloudflare's [Application Services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/). Security capabilities such as [web application firewalls](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/), [DDoS mitigation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-mitigation/), [DNS management](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/), and [bot management](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-bot-management/) help Tang's staff regain visibility and protection over their expanding footprint of digital properties.\n\n\"Due to their technical advancement, you cannot stop the bot attacks without the observability of a tool like Cloudflare,\" says Tang. \"Using Cloudflare for visibility, we can query malicious traffic, identify the attack patterns, and use that intel to develop solutions to mitigate them.\" \n\nAdopting Cloudflare's Application Services has also helped Delivery Hero more efficiently manage global demand across its websites.\n\n\"We see traffic spikes year-round across regions because of different holidays, marketing activity, or annual festivals.\" says Tang. \"It is not unusual for us to see a 3x traffic surge in one country, and a 10x burst in another the following day.\" \n\nUsing Cloudflare, Delivery Hero has insulated itself against these demand spikes, whether expected or unexpected, and is able to deliver consistently high-speed experiences for their customers year-round. Tang estimates that using the Cloudflare connectivity cloud has reduced latency, slashed Delivery Hero's bandwidth costs by 90%, and helped the company achieve a cache hit rate of 98.5% for its vast library of product images and other online assets. \n\n\"Cloudflare's global network and cache reserve have reduced our infrastructure costs and improved our image and static asset delivery times,\" says Tang. \"The savings are huge, several petabytes per month.\"\n\n### __Securing and streamlining development__\n\nOne final area where consolidating onto Cloudflare's connectivity cloud has helped Delivery Hero is with making development safer and easier. \n\nFor example, Delivery Hero has mandated that all new features for websites and apps are built with Cloudflare's security protections. \n\n\"Cloudflare is so secure and so easy to use we have made it a compulsory tool for our development teams,\" says Tang. \"Whenever we develop a new API endpoint, it must be behind Cloudflare, so we can properly protect and manage it.\"\n\nDelivery Hero also uses Cloudflare Workers, a developer platform to build and deploy serverless applications and functions. By configuring changes on Workers, Tang and his team can scale those changes across Delivery Hero's application footprint with speed.\n\n\"Cloudflare Workers is so easy to deploy. In minutes, we can make changes, create third-party integrations, or onboard new technologies that would otherwise take us hundreds of hours of development and testing,\" says Tang.\n\nThroughout the years tackling various use cases with Cloudflare, Tang has had a positive experience.\n\n\"Cloudflare has supported us every step of the way. From our account managers and customer success agents to Cloudflare technical support, somebody is always on hand to help us achieve our business goals.\"  \n",

								"longDescription": "## __Porsche Informatik secures and automates \"Cloud Smart\" migration of over 3000 dealer websites with Cloudflare__ \n\nPorsche Informatik is a subsidiary of Europe's largest and most successful automotive distributor in Europe, [Porsche Holding Salzburg](https://www.porsche-holding.com/en), and develops groundbreaking software solutions for the mobility of the future. Its over 180 customized software solutions — serve users in 34 countries across four continents, and has been part of the Volkswagen Group since March 2011.\n\nVolkswagen Group owns some of the continent's most recognizable and prestigious automotive brands. These include Porsche and Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley, CUPRA, Lamborghini, SEAT, and ŠKODA.\n\n### __Challenge: Securing a global cloud migration__\n\nAs Porsche Holdings' full-service IT and technical services supplier, Porsche Informatik builds and maintains an international sales and support infrastructure that includes automobile dealership management, vehicle financing, distribution, and logistics planning systems.\n\nTo achieve a safe, seamless transition to the cloud, Porsche Informatik had a series of very specific goals. These included:\n\n- Securing web assets and customer domains against increasingly sophisticated malicious Internet activity\n- Ensuring resilience and high availability in the face of unstable international network conditions to promote and retain customer trust\n- Automating domain migration and SSL management processes\n- Complying with European and international data localization regulations and best practices\n\n\"With the inventory of legacy applications we have amassed over the last 20 years, Porsche Informatik wanted to ensure that both, our newer modern and our classic client-server applications, were cloud-ready,\" says Thomas Zangl, Head of Cloud and Virtualization service at Porsche Informatik. \"To do that, we needed a partner like Cloudflare to help us address our challenges, limit the dependencies in our legacy applications, and gain maximum benefits of migrating workloads from our data centers to managed services in the cloud.\" \n\n### __Establishing a partnership — Securing web applications and public access points against DDoS attacks__\n\nPorsche Informatik began its Cloudflare journey in 2022 with a series of smaller-scale tests and proofs of concept (POCs). However, with the outbreak of the Ukrainian conflict, it shifted from evaluating Cloudflare to implementing the [Cloudflare WAF and Application services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/) and [Advanced DDoS Protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/) across all of its public websites, endpoints, and applications.\n\n\"We experienced a marked increase in malicious traffic from what appeared to be well-financed, professional groups, but Cloudflare absorbed the attacks directed towards us,\" says Zangl. \"We easily secured our public web infrastructure behind the global network's best-in-class DDoS and zero-day exploit protection.\"\n\nPorsche Informatik and Cloudflare began their enterprise partnership based on the success of this real-world trial by fire. Porsche Informatik's goal was to leverage the connectivity cloud and Cloudflare's integrated performance, developer, and application services to streamline and simplify its full-scale cloud transformation.  \n\n\"With all our public access points already safe behind Cloudflare, we decided to make everything easier to manage by consolidating security for all of our cloud-hosted workloads in using the Cloudflare ecosystem rather than a complex web of disparate technologies,\" says Zangl.\n\n### __Enhanced resilience and high availability improve the customer experience with 40% faster page loads__\n\nBecause website and application performance are key drivers of consumer confidence, improving the customer experience topped Porsche Informatik's list of transformation priorities. \n\n\"We needed to improve our resilience — to guarantee that our platforms offered optimal performance to all our users and remained available 99+% of the time,\" asserts Zangl. \"Anything less and our reputation and user trust would suffer.\" \n\nTo bolster that customer trust, Porsche Informatik began enhancing its customer experience. By transferring its web content and assets to the Cloudflare global network and leveraging   Cloudflare's 310 data centers in over 120 countries around the world, Porsche Informatik can engage with its customers at the point of service through  13,000 ISP, cloud, and enterprise network service providers.   \n\n\"Cloudflare gave us next-level content delivery services that addressed our performance issues,\" says Zangl. \"The Cloudflare network puts us closer to our customers, and provides them with the best website and customer service performance possible.\" \n\nFor Porsche Informatik's international network of customers, dealers, and service technicians the improvements were unmistakable. Augmenting the CDN using [Cloudflare Load Balancing](https://cloudflare.com/application-services/products/load-balancing/), [Argo Smart Routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/argo-smart-routing/), [Cloudflare R2 Distributed Object Storage](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/), and [Workers from the Cloudflare developer platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers/) to build and run applications near the end-user reduced bandwidth costs and provided massive performance and usability improvements to Porsche Informatik's online car configurator, ordering software and service queues. \n\n\"We were a global company challenged by performance bottlenecks, especially outside Europe, because we were streaming from a European server,\" says Günter Schulmeister, Porsche Informatik's Cloud Transformation Lead. \"Using Cloudflare to store and stream content on the global network, our partners in countries like Chile, Malaysia, and Japan enjoy the greatest gains — not only do they see far better website performance, they are better protected against cyber security attacks.\" \n\n\"Cloudflare reduced the loading time of our webpages by 40%,\" says Zangl. \"Having a globally distributed assets cache, using Workers to power our applications, and avoiding bottlenecks with smart routing and load balancer makes our websites faster and more reliable.\"\n\n### __Reducing bandwidth consumption by 95% and improving server performance on the global network__ \n\nCloudflare's connectivity cloud also reduces the load on Porsche Informatik's core data centers, both in the cloud and on-premises. According to Zangl, the global network now handles 95% of Porsche Informatik's public traffic. Besides the cost savings, Cloudflare frees up enough headroom on Porsche Informatik's local servers to efficiently fulfill other business objectives. \n\n\"By caching our public access content on Cloudflare we have gained the capacity to onboard new services and tolerate greater loads without over-provisioning costly bandwidth,\" says Daniel Ivanovski, Systems Engineer, Porsche Informatik. \"That improves the performance of our internal and back office applications and allows us to manage our cloud services more cost-effectively.\" \n\n### __Automating customer domain management and migration for 3000+ websites__\n\nWith all of the Porsche Holding's and the Volkswagen Group's dealer, financing, and brand websites under its care, Porsche Informatik needed to find an efficient method of maintaining DNS, managing security certificates, and migrating customer website sites into the cloud. It was a daunting task, exacerbated by the fact that most of the domains were independently owned by subsidiaries. Using Cloudflare [SSL for SaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/ssl-for-saas-providers/) and the Cloudflare API, Zangl's team has streamlined the cumbersome process.\n\n\"We automate the website migration and SSL certificate maintenance process — I love it,\" says Zangl. \"Using Cloudflare API integration and an Everything as Code (EaC) approach to manage infrastructures, GitLab, and merge requests to define and delegate which websites need moving and provisioning, we have shared the burden, moving 3000 websites using customer-facing teams across the organization. Beyond making sure that changes are correct and well-documented, my people are free to focus on exploring other technologies.\"\n\nWith the sites live in the cloud, SSL for SaaS automates the certificate management lifecycle and simplifies site maintenance and configuration, ensuring the web portfolio remains secure and up-to-date.   \n\n### __Meeting data localization and international regulatory requirements__\n\nAs an automotive commerce industry institution that both sells vehicles and provides banking services, Porsche Holding Salzburg operates in a highly regulated environment. As a result, the company's Cloud migration presented Porsche Informatik with challenges specific to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other regulatory bodies. \n\n\"We are a European company and most of our customers are in Europe, so the GDPR dictates very specifically where and how we can store corporate and user data,\" explains Schulmeister. \"Cloudflare provides its enterprise partners with the right toolset to promote GDPR compliance.\"  \n\nUsing the [Cloudflare Data Localization Suite](https://www.cloudflare.com/data-localization/), Porsche Informatik maintains rigorous, auditable control over its data, determining precisely how and where it stores, transports, and encrypts information. Cloudflare also empowers the company to establish business rules for deploying region-specific Workers to execute its serverless applications and specify the location of data centers with authorization to inspect data for threats or anomalies.   \n\n### __The Cloudflare experience__\n\nAfter working closely with Cloudflare throughout the transformation, Schulmeister expresses confidence in the partnership between the Cloudflare and Porsche Informatik teams.   \n\n\"It was like receiving first-class, white-glove service. Our enterprise partnership with Cloudflare gave us access to localization features and services, dedicated account and support teams, and Cloudflare's great solution architects,\" he says \"From the beginning, Cloudflare understood that cloud transformation is about more than simply deploying cloud services, it's also about adapting to new challenges.\" \n\n### __Moving forward__\n\nPorsche Informatik plans to continue driving innovation toward a holistic online buying and automobile ownership experience. As it advances the automotive commerce sector to align with its vision, it recognizes Cloudflare as a pivotal component of its roadmap. \n\n\"The car dealership of the future will be completely digital,\" says Zangl. \"Soon, websites or online applications will support most, if not all, of the processes in our industry. As those applications become the heart of the business, customer trust and our success depend on innovation, security, availability, scalability, and performance. Cloudflare is the partner that allows us to focus on developing those applications without worrying about outside influences.\"\nAs Porsche Informatik and its clients continue to explore use cases for enhancing their products and services with emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the company sees Cloudflare playing a pivotal role, providing solutions where cyber security and AI intersect.\n\n\"Cloudflare is an industry leader in connectivity — it already monitors and secures a very large portion of the world's Internet traffic and few other platforms can make sense of what is happening online on such a grand scale,\" says Schulmeister. \"As we continue to innovate, Cloudflare is uniquely equipped to meet the challenge that AI presents in a way that is secure, scalable, and easily managed from a single access point.\"\n",

								"longDescription": "## __Improving PhonePe — Accelerating and securing over 3.6 billion monthly mobile payment transactions with Cloudflare__\n\nMobile payment systems are changing how the world transacts, and no country has adopted digital payments more rapidly  and on a larger scale than India. PhonePe leads that paradigm shift. \n\nWith a user base of nearly one in every four Indian citizens, PhonePe is a clear leader in the Indian digital payment space and in India's premier mobile payment platform [in every metric](https://inc42.com/buzz/phonepe-maintains-lead-in-upi-with-49-market-share-in-jan-2022-whatsapp-at-0-02/), consistently outperforming competitors. \n\n### __The Challenge: Ensuring compliant, secure, and low-latency financial transactions during daily high-traffic clusters__  \n\nScaling to meet their rapid growth — PhonePe has over 435 million registered users and processes over 3.6 billion transactions monthly. Given the scale the  company operates at, PhonePe was under pressure to provide secure, frictionless and quick service. \n\nWith their peak periods defining their network requirements, PhonePe sought a content delivery network (CDN) with the elasticity to absorb every daily traffic surge. More importantly, that solution had to handle dynamic traffic without introducing any latency that might undermine the user experience.\n\n\"Each transaction should take three seconds to complete — as that time increases, people lose patience. Once a transaction reaches 12 seconds, our users assume we are having problems, and volumes drop to zero as they turn to our competitors,\" says Burzin Engineer, PhonePe Co-founder and Chief Reliability Officer. \n\nBecause the quality of their customer experience is so significant to customer retention, PhonePe also needed a way to manage and efficiently deliver their static image and video content. \n\nNext, as a fintech platform partnering with banks, PhonePe wanted a single solution to provide real-time protection against threats like DDoS, malicious bots, and SQL injections. It also had to ensure instantaneous financial transactions on a massive scale.  \n\n\"Over 33 million merchants depend on PhonePe to fulfill their transactions, and we are under attack 24/7, 365 days a year,\" says Engineer. \"We needed the right partner and security tooling to thrive.\"\n\n### __Blocking malicious international traffic and promoting regulatory compliance with the Cloudflare WAF__  \n\nPhonePe selected Cloudflare as their [security solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) and content delivery partner based on a shared commitment to providing modern solutions and exceptional customer service. \n\n\"The Cloudflare tech stack interested us. Compared to the other vendors, it wasn't carrying the baggage of 20-year-old technologies,\" says Engineer. \"Cloudflare was newer and had a modern API-driven CDN purpose-built from the ground up.\"       \n\nThe company leadership was also banking on Cloudflare's commitment to developing relationships in India and improving the topology of its content delivery infrastructure nationwide.\n\nPhonePe began with the Cloudflare core security portfolio. With all of PhonePe's business conducted domestically, the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), managed rulesets, and the ability to geo-block traffic resulted in immediate security benefits. \n\n\"Using the Cloudflare WAF, we cut off more than 90% of malicious attacks by restricting traffic to sources within India,\" says Engineer. \"It gives us peace of mind to know that because everything flows through Cloudflare, we can protect our ingress and egress and keep our customers' data and money safe.\"\n\nCloudflare plays a key role in ensuring PhonePe maintains that critical uptime. Monthly, it detected and neutralized 180 million threats to the PhonePe application layer.   \n\nIn addition to protecting PhonePe's applications, Cloudflare simplifies the security auditing process and helps the platform meet its compliance requirements. The announcement that Cloudflare will [comply fully](https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/will-become-data-localization-compliant-in-india-by-decend-11661716747206.html) with India's incoming data localization and data residency requirements by the end of 2022 further eased PhonePe's regulatory needs. \n\n### __Cloudflare Workers and Stream: serverless image resizing and adaptive bitrate video delivery for a smooth, responsive user experience__\n\nWith their security and compliance concerns addressed and their applications and networks protected, PhonePe concentrated on further enhancing their user experience using Workers and the API-first Cloudflare global network.\n\nInitially, PhonePe optimized their millions of source images locally to ensure they were responsive on any device and to improve performance at the point of service. The resizing process required over 50 bare-metal origin servers — Cloudflare Workers eliminated the need for those machines. \n\n\"Once we offloaded the dynamic resizing and delivery of images for over 200 devices to Workers, all we needed to provide was a single high-resolution source image,\" explains Engineer. \"Workers resize, cache, and serve those images for us. It saves PhonePe resources, space and power. It also improves the user experience because it's faster.\"\n\nWith support from the Cloudflare engineering team, PhonePe conceived and implemented the change in under two months.\n\nAfter the success of offloading their responsive image processing to the edge, PhonePe moved on to optimizing their video content delivery. They chose Stream, the [live](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/live-streaming/) and on-demand Cloudflare video service that dynamically adapts each stream to network conditions. The Stream service proved ideal for mitigating video delivery issues caused by inconsistent mobile internet performance.\n\n\"Stream changes bitrate based on available bandwidth,\" says Engineer. \"Before we could choose from three bitrates but it was a one-time decision. Now, Stream changes rate dynamically and eliminates stall and jitter and improves our customer experience.\" \n\nUsing Workers and the Cloudflare global network, PhonePe now offloads an average of 80% of the traffic from their origin servers and enjoys corresponding savings in bandwidth and a 10x reduction in infrastructure costs. In a month, Cloudflare serves 775 billion requests for PhonePe — over 289,000 requests per second and their merchant notifications and image resizing use cases trigger 50 billion Workers requests.\n\nFor PhonePe, where network and security issues directly affect their customers and merchant partners, proactive Cloudflare support translates to peace of mind. \n\n\"It is comforting to have Cloudflare to tell us exactly what is happening, why it happened, and how the support team is coming together to fix it,\" says Engineer. \"While no company can guarantee perfection, how they react to problems shows you their true character, and Cloudflare's character is impeccable.\"\n",
