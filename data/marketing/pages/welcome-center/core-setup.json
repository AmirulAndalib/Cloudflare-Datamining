Purging all cached resources may temporarily degrade your web performance and increase bandwidth and CPU, as it forces Cloudflare to retrieve a new version of these files from your origin server. Cloudflare recommendation: Custom Purge.\n\n\n- __Caching Level__ tells Cloudflare how much of your website’s static content needs to be cached. Typically, the more content you cache, the faster your web pages load. Cloudflare recommendation: Standard Caching Level.\n\n\n- __Browser Cache TTL__ tells Cloudflare how long to cache files in a visitor’s browser. The expiration time can be set to respect existing headers, or set for an amount of time that ranges from 30 minutes to 1 year. Be aware that while longer expiration times ensure faster load times for repeat visitors, they can subsequently trigger slower update times when these files are modified. You may also use Page Rules to allow a different cache expiration time for a specific path or resource.\n\n![Caching settings copy](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/Na9PjLCjlMxa81dMJ7vd2/8ba4c1cac6fc1442b85699a764e2056f/Caching_settings_copy.png)"

There are five primary types of attacks Cloudflare helps mitigate: HTTP flood attacks, UDP flood attacks, SYN flood attacks, ACK flood attacks, and QUIC flood attacks. To learn how these attacks work, visit our [DDoS Learning Center](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/). Under attack? Learn how to [respond to a DDoS attack](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170196).\n\n__Opportunistic Encryption:__\nOpportunistic Encryption adds a layer of security to websites that have not migrated to HTTPS. When this feature is enabled, users will be able to access sites over an encrypted connection, but will continue to see “http” in the address bar. Opportunistic Encryption is not a substitute for HTTPS, which should be used when strong encryption and authentication are required.\n\n__TLS 1.3:__\nTLS 1.3 is the latest version of the TLS protocol, which uses HTTPS to encrypt communications between a client and web server. TLS 1.3 offers several significant security and performance advantages over previous versions of TLS, including security patches for known vulnerabilities and decreased latency and load times.\n\n__Automatic HTTPS Rewrites:__\nWhen you connect to your site over HTTPS, but see an information or warning icon in the URL instead of a lock icon, your site may be experiencing an issue with mixed content. With Automatic HTTPS Rewrites, Cloudflare can help keep your site secure by rewriting insecure HTTP resources and links as HTTPS resources and links. To learn more about the limitations of this feature, see [Understanding Automatic HTTPS Rewrites](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/227227647-Understanding-Automatic-HTTPS-rewrites).\n\n__Email Address Obfuscation:__\nScrape Shield is a free app that protects your domain from email spam and bandwidth abuse, while automatically hiding specific content on your site from suspicious visitors. Email Address Obfuscation is automatically enabled for your site under the Scrape Shield tab of your Dashboard."
