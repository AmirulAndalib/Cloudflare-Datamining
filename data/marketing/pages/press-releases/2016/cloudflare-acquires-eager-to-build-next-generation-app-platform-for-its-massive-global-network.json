				"body": "<p>December 13, 2016\t(Press Release) - SAN FRANCISCO, CA - <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com\">Cloudflare</a>, the leading Internet performance and security company, today announced it has acquired Eager Platform Co., an app platform for web property owners. The acquisition joins Cloudflare's extensive global network with Eager's platform to create a next-generation app platform experience that is secure, seamless, and easy to use for customers of all technical backgrounds.</p>\n <p>The platform will enable Cloudflare customers to install tools to make their Internet properties more attractive, powerful, and revenue generating. It will also let app developers reach a new audience of customers who would not typically have access, or the ability, to easily implement third party plugins.</p>\n <p>\"Eager has built a high-quality product for both developers and web property owners, that, when integrated with Cloudflare's vast network, will make adding applications drag-and-drop simple,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. \"Together we're democratizing access to Internet tools to help our users accomplish things that were impossible before.\"</p>\n <p>In the last year, Cloudflare has expanded its global presence to 101 data centers in 49 countries, and now has more than 5 million customers. The next-generation app platform will further broaden the company's reach and enable site owners and developers to enhance web properties in a simple and secure way.</p>\n <p><strong>Cloudflare Apps: The App Platform for Everyone</strong><br>\n The Eager App Platform will be integrated into Cloudflare's existing infrastructure, offering a single, streamlined marketplace for customers and developers.</p>\n <p><strong>For Customers (and anyone online):</strong> Users will be able to install plugins within seconds, without the need to hire a developer or handle code, while ensuring powerful functionality on top of the performance, security, and reliability benefits already enjoyed by Cloudflare's customers. The enhanced platform will be accessible to all Cloudflare customers, with plans to develop an enterprise-specific app experience in the near future.</p>\n <p><strong>For Developers:</strong> Developers will benefit from the seamless installation process, best-in-class documentation, and powerful app creation flow. Rather than having to invest in sales and marketing initiatives, developers can focus on improving their tools and leveraging the Cloudflare platform to grow their user base and revenue.</p>\n <p>\"Apps and tools have been installed the same way for the last 20 years and now that we're part of the Cloudflare team, we have an opportunity to make the web a lot easier for every user,\" said Zack Bloom, co-founder of Eager. \"This acquisition also signals a tremendous opportunity for web developers, who will be able to release and even sell tools to millions of devoted Cloudflare customers.\"</p>\n <p>The next-generation Cloudflare Apps platform will be available in mid-2017. Starting today, Eager will begin to sunset its current platform, but apps previously installed on customer sites will continue to function indefinitely. Eager's team will continue to operate out of Boston.</p>\n <p><strong>Developers, interested in learning how you can get involved?
