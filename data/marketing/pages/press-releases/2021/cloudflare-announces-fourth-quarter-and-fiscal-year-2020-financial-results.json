Reconciliations between historical GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained at the end of this press release following the accompanying financial data.\n\n__Financial Outlook__\n\nThe following forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook are subject to substantial uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect our estimates as of February 11, 2021 regarding the impact of the pandemic on our operations, and are highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including, among others: the duration, spread, and severity of the pandemic; actions taken by governments and businesses in response to the pandemic and the resulting impact on our customers, vendors, and partners; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity generally; our ability to continue operating in impacted areas; and customer demand and spending patterns.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2021, we expect: \n- Total revenue of $130 to $131 million\n- Non-GAAP loss from operations of $9 to $8 million\n- Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.03 to $0.02, utilizing weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 306 million\n\nFor the full year 2021, we expect:\n- Total revenue of $589 to $593 million\n- Non-GAAP loss from operations of $25 to $21 million\n- Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.09 to $0.08, utilizing weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 309 million\n\n__Conference Call Information__\n\nCloudflare will host an investor conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 earnings results today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern time).

Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we have transitioned the method for calculating our key business metrics from a billings-based methodology to a revenue-based methodology. We believe the change in methodology to GAAP-based metrics provides improved disclosures for our investors by better aligning our key business metrics with GAAP and our financial statements and will provide a better representation of these important components of our operating model and business performance as we continue to scale. We have recast these metrics for the historical period prior to March 31, 2020 to reflect this new methodology in our supplemental materials.\n\n__Non-GAAP Financial Information__\n\nCloudflare believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP are included at the end of this press release following the accompanying financial data. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty of expenses that may be incurred in the future. For further information regarding why Cloudflare believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors, the specific manner in which management uses these measures, and some of the limitations associated with the use of these measures, please refer to the “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section at the end of this press release.\n\n__Available Information__\n\nCloudflare intends to use its press releases, website, investor relations website, news site, blog, Twitter account, and Instagram account, in addition to filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and public conference calls, as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. \n\n__Forward-Looking Statements__ \n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
