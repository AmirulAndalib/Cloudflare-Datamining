The Cloudflare Workers Developer Platform was ranked as differentiated in eight criteria, including developer experience, programming model, integrations, and roadmap. \n\n\"With Cloudflare's Workers platform, we hope to empower the next billion dollar enterprise to be built entirely on Cloudflare,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. \"Whether you are an individual developer, a small business, or large enterprise, it's truly powerful to build apps that can solve real-world problems and can run in seconds, globally, all with less code and faster.\"\n\nIn the Forrester New Wave™: Edge Development Platforms, Forrester notes, \"Cloudflare has an intuitive developer experience, fast, global deployment of updated code, and minimal cold start times.\" The report continues, \"the global reach and breadth of Cloudflare's edge development platform makes it a good solution for development teams that want to build high-performance web sites, support personalized content, and defend against malicious attacks.\"\n\nLaunched in 2017, the Cloudflare Workers edge-based serverless platform helps developers to deploy code instantly across the globe for exceptional performance, reliability, and scale. Workers runs at global scale by default because it automatically routes traffic across Cloudflare's network of more than 250 cities in over 100 countries. Since its launch, Cloudflare has increased the speed of Cloudflare Workers  by 30 percent, [eliminated cold starts](https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-cold-starts-with-cloudflare-workers/), and expanded the platform to include solutions across compute, storage, and front end services that transform what's possible to build at the edge. Today, more than a hundred thousand developers worldwide use Cloudflare Workers to: \n\n- __Release Code Instantly Worldwide:__ Developers can update their code and have it live globally in 15 seconds, compared with the minutes it can take to update on other serverless platforms.\n- __Get Security and Reliability Out-of-the-Box:__  Workers is built to withstand the latest security threats and offers Cloudflare's DDoS protection and more by default.\n- __Integrate Smoothly with Other Tools:__ With integrations to a wide range of storage providers, databases, public clouds, and APIs, developers can build exactly what they want with tools they already have in place.\n\nForrester evaluated nine participating vendors based on 10 criteria including developer experience, platform execution model, workload breadth, security, integrations and more.
