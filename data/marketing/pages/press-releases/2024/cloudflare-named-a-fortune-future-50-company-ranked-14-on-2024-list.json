This recognition comes at the end of a groundbreaking year for the company in which it blocked on average 165 billion cyber threats per day during the third quarter, including [the largest DDoS attack in the world](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q3/?utm_campaign=cf_blog&utm_content=20241030&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_source=twitter), launched new tools to help websites of any size [control how their content is used by AI bots](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2024/cloudflare-helps-content-creators-regain-control-of-content-from-ai/), and helped to secure presidential campaigns and local governments during the US elections. \n\n\"From global elections to the explosion of AI, 2024 has been a year of rapid change in which we have all relied on the Internet more than ever before. I am proud of how our team continues to rise to the occasion to help our customers solve some of the hardest problems they face when modernizing, transforming, and securing their businesses,\" said Matthew Prince, Co-founder and CEO at Cloudflare. \"The recognition on the Fortune Future 50 for another year only further underscores how we're continuing to deliver more value to organizations with the power of our connectivity cloud.\"\n\nToday [about 20% of the web](https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/proxy/all) runs through Cloudflare's network, in addition to Internet properties like mobile apps, APIs, AI workflows, and corporate networks. Cloudflare has millions of customers, of which more than 221,000 are paying customers including 35 percent of the Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare's rapid product expansion has enabled the company to penetrate adjacent markets, fueling its [total addressable market growth](https://cloudflare.net/files/doc_downloads/Presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-Investor-Presentation_v3.pdf) from $176 billion in 2024 to $222 billion by 2027.  \n\nFortune and Boston Consulting Group examined nearly 3,000 companies globally, ranking the top 50 based on an assessment of their long-term growth prospects. The Fortune Future 50 index complements traditional performance metrics with an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of the world's publicly traded companies with more than $5 billion in market value and privately held firms with at least $1 billion in funding. The ranked companies were selected for their ability to predict long-term sales growth and evaluated on business dimensions across Strategy, Technology, Talent, and Culture. \n\nAlongside its consecutive Fortune Future 50 accolades in [2024](https://fortune.com/ranking/future-50/2024/) and [2023](https://fortune.com/2023/12/04/fortune-future-50-index-2023-vitality-growth-china-mercadolibre-doordash-spotify/), Cloudflare has received a number of other industry and editorial recognitions for its business, culture, leadership, and innovation in the last year, including:  \n\n- Fortune [Change the World](https://fortune.com/ranking/change-the-world/) 2024\n- CNBC [Changemakers](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/michelle-zatlyn-cnbc-changemakers.html) 2024\n- Fast Company [Most Innovative Companies](https://www.fastcompany.com/91035538/cloudflare-most-innovative-companies-2024) 2024\n- Deloitte [Technology Fast 500](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/fast500-winners.html) 2024\n- Newsweek [Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/rankings/most-loved-workplaces-2024) 2024\n- Reuters Events [Sustainable Business Awards Finalist](https://events.reutersevents.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-awards/winners) 2024\n- Inc.
