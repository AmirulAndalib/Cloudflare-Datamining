Now combining cloud-native, market-leading Zero Trust protection and connectivity from [Cloudflare One™](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/) with best-in-class AI-native cybersecurity from CrowdStrike Falcon® Next-Gen SIEM on the [CrowdStrike Falcon® cybersecurity platform](https://www.crowdstrike.com/platform/endpoint-security/), joint channel partners can drive vendor consolidation while reducing cost and operational complexity for customers worldwide.\n\nToday's adversaries are moving faster than ever across growing threat vectors. Organizations are attempting to manage an array of cybersecurity tools and alerts, and as a result are facing complex, if not already compromised, internal networks. According to Gartner®, \"The challenge is intensified by the growing arsenal of security tools designed to address individual security threats in isolation. This drives up the complexity of evaluating, managing and integrating these tools as part of a coherent security strategy.\"  It's critical for organizations across all sectors to have an AI-powered cybersecurity platform that connects remote users, offices, and data centers to converge data, security, and IT, with workflow automation to stop adversaries from moving laterally and further into systems.\n\nCrowdStrike and Cloudflare are leveraging channel partnerships to deliver a fully integrated solution to global customers from a single API. The powerful combination of cybersecurity from the Falcon platform with Zero Trust protection from Cloudflare delivers the full-scope capabilities SOC teams need to detect and respond to attacks across network, devices, endpoints, cloud, identity, data, and applications. \n\n\"CrowdStrike revolutionized cybersecurity with a modern, AI-native platform focused on stopping the breach. Our ability to execute on this mission and continually innovate across critical areas of enterprise risk is why we're recognized as cybersecurity's born in the cloud leader by industry analysts and customers,\" said Daniel Bernard, Chief Business Officer at CrowdStrike. \"The rich dataset from our Falcon platform paired with Cloudflare's robust Zero Trust capabilities provides unprecedented value for global customers. Together, we are converging two of the most critical pieces of the risk management puzzle that organizations of every size must address in order to combat today's growing threats.\"\n\n\"It's becoming too complex for enterprises to effectively and efficiently manage risk posture with today's expanding threat landscape. There is a significant need for organizations to enforce holistic and robust protections across their networks as attack vectors are only growing in size and sophistication,\" said Grant Bourzikas, Chief Security Officer at Cloudflare. \"We have already seen organizations simultaneously adopting both Cloudflare and CrowdStrike; now, this partnership makes it simple for customers to reap the benefits of the industry's leading cybersecurity providers, to enforce best-of-breed security across organizations.\" \n\nCombining Cloudflare's [connectivity cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/) and infrastructure network, one of the largest and most interconnected in the world — alongside CrowdStrike's market-leading cybersecurity platform — organizations can now easily achieve visibility into risk signals and stop breaches.
