The market is coming to Cloudflare, and the time is now,\" said Mark Anderson, President of Revenue at Cloudflare. \"When I started to think about where I could make the most impact during the next stage of my career, I reached out to Matthew and Michelle to see if I could help lead Cloudflare's go-to-market organization to the next level. I am incredibly excited to be joining the team as we all work together to make Cloudflare one of the most iconic technology companies in the history of the industry.\"\n\nIn a natural evolution to continue to more tightly align all aspects related go-to-market strategy and operations to best scale and accelerate Cloudflare's next phase of growth, Anderson will oversee Cloudflare's sales organization as well as marketing and customer success operations.
