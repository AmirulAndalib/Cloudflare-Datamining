Boroditsky brings his 30+ years of experience scaling high performance revenue organizations at global software companies including Twilio, Authy, and Oracle to support Cloudflare on its continued path of growth. \n\n\"It's rare to join a company that is fundamentally changing an industry, and Cloudflare is truly helping to build a better Internet,\" said Marc Boroditsky, President of Revenue at Cloudflare. \"The Internet is foundational in almost everything that we do today and Cloudflare is well-positioned to help customers safely and reliably scale online. I'm thrilled to be joining Matthew, Michelle, and the entire team at Cloudflare on this journey to even greater heights.\" \n\nMarc is now overseeing Cloudflare's sales organization, which was led by Chris Merritt, Cloudflare's former President of Field Operations and Chief Revenue Officer. Joining Cloudflare nearly 10 years ago, Chris built the organization from the ground up. Chris will continue to help with the transition through the end of the year, and will serve in an advisory capacity for a period of time after that. \n\n\"Very few sales leaders can say that they built a company from $0 in revenue to $1 billion,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. \"Chris built a world-class sales organization, and thought hitting the $1 billion mark was the right point for a transition. We worked together to find the right leader to build on the success we've had, and help us achieve our goal of $5 billion over the next five years. I'm grateful for everything we have accomplished thus far, and look forward to this next leg of the journey, with Marc leading a path he has traveled before.\" \n\n__Conference Call Information__\n\nCloudflare will host an investor conference call to discuss its third quarter ended September 30, 2022 earnings results today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern time).
