(NYSE: NET), the security, performance, and reliability company helping to build a better Internet, has been positioned in the Leaders category in the [IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Commercial CDN 2022 Vendor Assessment](https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/idc-worldwide-cdn-marketscape/) (doc #US47652821, March 2022).\n\n\"We aim to be the network that any business can plug into to deliver the fastest, most reliable, and most secure experiences, without having to worry about anything else. That's why we are hyper focused on expanding our network, and building new products on top of it at a relentless pace of innovation,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. \"Whether a customer initially joins us to support their performance needs, or to adopt a Zero Trust security model, we want to solve for their business needs without the security or performance trade-offs they'd have to make with other vendors.\"\n\nThe IDC MarketScape report notes, \"[Cloudflare's] clear strategy to invest in new technology but also expand its network as well as its sales machine across these new territories has resulted in a tremendous growth curve in the past years.\"\n\nBy continuously expanding and optimizing its network, Cloudflare is able to deliver a faster and more reliable Internet experience to users and businesses anywhere in the world. Cloudflare's global network spans more than 250 cities in over 100 countries and interconnects with over 10,000 networks globally, including major ISPs, cloud services, and enterprises. In 2021, the company [announced](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-grows-its-network-to-speed-up-and-secure-the-internet/) it grew its network by 25 percent and doubled its overall network capacity to 121Tbps in the last two years alone.   \n\nThe company also launched its Zero Trust suite of products called Cloudflare One in 2020 as businesses were experiencing a drastic shift in the workplace—and how to protect it. Those changes have only accelerated since then, and Cloudflare has continued to invest and innovate to equip organizations with the Zero Trust tools they need. The IDC MarketScape notes in the report that, \"Cloudflare's enterprise security Zero Trust services stack is extensive and meets secure access requirements of the distributed workforce.\"\n\nIDC MarketScape: Worldwide Commercial CDN 2022 Vendor Assessment evaluates 10 CDN vendors based on their current capabilities and future strategies for delivering Commercial CDN services.
