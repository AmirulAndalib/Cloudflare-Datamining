Cloudflare is also introducing the first cohort of startups participating in the program, featuring 25 companies from 10 countries.\n\n\"When we set out to debut the Workers Launchpad, we were aiming for $250 million and surpassed that goal by a mile when we hit $1.25 billion. To reach $2 billion is a big deal, and one that proves the industry trusts in the potential of our global network\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO, Cloudflare. \"As we hit 1 million developers building and maintaining applications with Cloudflare, there's no better time to continue investing in the developers using Cloudflare.\" \n\nThe [Cloudflare Workers Launchpad funding program](https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/workers-launchpad/) initially launched in September 2022 to provide up to $1.25 billion of financing to startups building applications on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), a highly-scalable serverless computing platform that allows developers to build or augment apps without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. In the days and weeks following, Cloudflare received a surge in interest globally from venture capitalists interested in joining the program.
