				"body": "San Francisco, CA, April 1, 2022 — [Cloudflare, Inc.](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (NYSE: NET), the security, performance, and reliability company helping to build a better Internet, today announced it has completed its acquisition of Area 1 Security. \n\nEmail is both one of the largest cloud applications for any business, and the biggest security threats that organizations of all sizes face. Yet legacy email security solutions are often expensive, overly complex, and disjointed from an organization's holistic security strategy. Further, malicious phishing and business email compromise campaigns are incredibly costly—with U.S. businesses losing more than $2.4 billion a year according to data from the [FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center 2021 Internet Crime Report](https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2021_IC3Report.pdf). With the acquisition of Area 1 Security, Cloudflare will provide organizations an easy way to block phishing, malware, business email compromise and other advanced threats as part of an integrated, Zero Trust approach to securing all of their organizations' applications.\n\n\"Cloudflare's mission is to help build a better Internet, and we've invested heavily in building the world's most powerful cloud network to deliver a faster, safer, and more reliable Internet for our users. Now we're officially able to welcome the Area 1 team to Cloudflare and enhance our ability to secure the number one place where security threats come from, email,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder & CEO of Cloudflare. \"To us, Zero Trust security without email built in is worth nearly zero. By bringing email security and Zero Trust together with Area 1 Security, we believe that we will give customers the most complete Zero Trust security platform available.\"\n\nArea 1 Security's cloud native platform, which works seamlessly with any email offering, stops phishing and other advanced email attacks by preemptively discovering and eliminating them before they can inflict damage in a corporate environment. By combining Area 1 Security's highly scalable technology and years of experience in email protection with Cloudflare's global network, the two companies will provide a holistic Zero Trust solution that customers can enable through Cloudflare's global network. Area 1 Security's email security capabilities will be available for purchase for all enterprise plan customers today, and will be available to customers on all other paid plans in the months to come.  \n\n\"Cloudflare delivers one of the world's leading Zero Trust networks, and we're excited about what we'll be able to build together for our customers and channel partners,\" said Patrick Sweeney, CEO and President of Area 1 Security. \"By joining forces, Area 1's technology and Cloudflare's global network will give customers the most complete Zero Trust security platform available, inclusive of securing the most critical of today's business applications – your email.\"\n\nTo learn more, please check out the resources below:\n- Overview: [Cloudflare Area 1 Email Security](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/email-security/) \n- [Complimentary Phishing Risk Assessment](https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/emailsecurity/)\n- Cloudflare Blog: [Why We're Acquiring Area 1 Security](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-are-acquiring-area-1)\n- Cloudflare Blog: [Democratizing email security: protecting individuals and businesses of all sizes from phishing and malware attacks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/democratizing-email-security/)\n\n__About Cloudflare__ \nCloudflare, Inc.
