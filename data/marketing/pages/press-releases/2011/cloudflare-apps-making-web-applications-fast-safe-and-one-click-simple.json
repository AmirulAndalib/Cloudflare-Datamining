Cloudflare works with the\napplication providers to ensure apps perform as well as\npossible and do not create conflicts with other code.\nApps are automatically updated to the latest version\nwithout the website owner needing to make a change.\n</p>\n<p>\n“With apps, site owners can now focus on adding new features\nwithout needing additional development time or worrying\nabout security and performance,” said Matthew Prince, CEO\nand co-founder of Cloudflare. “We’re excited to be working\nwith leading web application providers to create a marketplace\nwhere apps can be installed with ease and confidence.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnnounced today at TechCrunch Disrupt New York City, apps\n(<a href=\"/apps/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cloudflare.com/apps</a>)\nwill roll out starting June 1 with applications from:\n</p><ul>\n<li>VigLink (affiliate links)</li>\n<li>Clicky (real-time website analytics)</li>\n<li>Apture (contextual search)</li>\n<li>Smartling (language translation)</li>\n<li>Monitis (site and server monitoring)</li>\n<li>UserVoice (customer engagement tools)</li>\n<li>Pingdom (website uptime monitoring)</li>\n<li>SnapEngage (live chat)</li>\n<li>ExceptionHub (JavaScript error tracking)</li>\n<li>Zoompf (web performance scanning)</li>\n<li>Typekit (web fonts)</li>\n<li>GlobalSign HackAlert (malware detection)</li>\n<li>WatchMouse (site performance monitoring)</li>\n<li>TRUSTe (privacy seal)</li>\n<li>Haileo (video and image advertising)</li>\n<li>Skimlinks (affiliate links)</li>\n<li>StopTheHacker (malware detection)</li>\n<li>Google Analytics (website analytics)</li>\n<li>Google Webmaster Central (website validation)</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCloudflare began testing the apps concept more than a year ago\nby allowing web administrators to install Google Analytics with\na single click.
