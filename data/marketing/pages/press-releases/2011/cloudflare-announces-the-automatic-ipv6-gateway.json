				"body": "<strong>San Francisco, CA, September 27, 2011</strong>\n<p>\nCloudflare, the web performance and security company, today\nlaunched its Automatic IPv6 Gateway. The Gateway allows any\nwebsite to have a presence on the IPv6 Internet without\nchanging their legacy IPv4 infrastructure.\n</p>\n<p>\n“People have been talking about the challenges of moving from\nIPv4 to IPv6 for more than a decade,” said Matthew Prince,\nco-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. “With Cloudflare’s global\nnetwork, we realized we could provide the first viable service\nthat would allow any website to join the modern Internet\nwithout the pain and expense of upgrading their infrastructure.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of the Internet currently runs on Internet Protocol\nVersion 4 (IPv4) which was originally developed in the\n1970s. This protocol limits the public Internet to around\n4 billion devices. With the Internet’s explosive growth,\nthe number of on-net devices is closing in on IPv4’s maximum\ncapacity. IPv6, the next Internet protocol, with its capacity\nto allow up to 340 undecillion devices, more devices than\nthere are atoms on the surface of the Earth, will allow\ncontinued Internet growth.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately, IPv6 is not compatible with IPv4. As a result,\nvisitors using one protocol cannot connect to websites using\nthe other without a gateway bridging the two networks. The\nprevious and most common gateway solutions are hardware based\nand cost tens of thousands of dollars per website.\nCloudflare’s Automatic IPv6 Gateway seamlessly bridges\nthe IPv4 and IPv6 networks without requiring any hardware\nor other infrastructure changes. Cloudflare is providing\nthe Automatic IPv6 Gateway for free to all its customers.\n</p>\n<p>\n“While companies will still eventually upgrade their\ninfrastructure to support IPv6, Cloudflare now allows them\nto do so on their own schedule and as their budgets allow,”\nsaid David Conrad, former head of IANA and now part of\nCloudflare’s IPv6 technical team. “Cloudflare is providing\nthe first easy-to-implement solution that will lead to a\nmass increase in the IPv6 web.”\n</p>\n<p>\nPrior to Cloudflare’s Automatic IPv6 Gateway, estimates of\naround 10,000 websites were available via IPv6. More than\n10,000 sites participated in the private beta of the\nGateway—effectively doubling the size of the IPv6 web.\nCloudflare anticipates with the public release of the Automatic\nIPv6 Gateway, the number of websites now on the IPv6 web will\nincrease by nearly ten fold.\n</p>",
