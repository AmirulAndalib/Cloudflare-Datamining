The Journal\nrecognized Cloudflare's innovative technology that improves\nany website's performance and protects it from a wide\nrange of cyber attacks.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The Cloudflare team is honored to receive the Wall Street\nJournal's Innovation Award,\" said Matthew Prince,\nco-founder &amp; CEO of Cloudflare. \"Cloudflare is helping\nimprove the performance and security of all types of\nwebsites, ranging from individual blogs to Fortune 500\ncompanies to national governments. Our goal is nothing\nshort of building a faster, safer Internet for everyone.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBased in San Francisco, Cloudflare launched in September\n2010, and in the last year has grown to accelerate and\nprotect more than 100,000 websites worldwide. Through a\nglobal network of 14 data centers, Cloudflare delivers 15\nbillion page views per monthâ€”more than Amazon, Wikipedia,\nand Twitter combined.\n</p>\n<p>\nKey to Cloudflare's innovation is that the service gets\nsmarter with each website that joins the network. Cloudflare\nlearns about attacks directed at one site and automatically\napplies that knowledge to protect other sites on the network.\nSince its launch, Cloudflare has stopped more than 100\nbillion attacks directed at its customers' websites.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Providing effective web security requires having insight\ninto the changing landscape of cyber attacks,\" explained\nMr. Prince. \"The diversity of websites on the Cloudflare\nnetwork means we have a real-time understanding of web\nthreats. This allows us to provide comprehensive web\nsecurity not possible from a traditional hardware- or\nsoftware-based approach.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile traditional security and performance solutions require\ninstalling hardware or software, Cloudflare is provisioned\nthough a simple change to a website's domain settings. This\nmeans that a company can add Cloudflare to its existing\ninfrastructure and begin seeing benefits in minutes.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce setup, a website's traffic is routed through Cloudflare's\nglobal network where it is cleaned of threats and optimized\nfor maximum performance. Every month, Cloudflare saves more\nthan 50 lives worth of time that would have otherwise been\nwasted waiting for websites to load.\n</p>",
