				"body": "__San Francisco, CA, and Brussels, Belgium, [March 30, 2023]__ — [Cloudflare, Inc.](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (NYSE: NET), the security, performance, and reliability company helping to build a better Internet, today announced it has successfully demonstrated compliance with the EU Cloud Code of Conduct, a code officially approved under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), providing tailored guidance for GDPR implementation. The EU Cloud Code of Conduct covers all cloud service layers, and compliance is validated by accredited monitoring body SCOPE Europe. Cloudflare's global network and strong commitment to upholding the very highest data protection standards will encourage the adoption of privacy-protecting cloud services across the continent by reinforcing for end users the importance of data protection.\n\nThe [EU Cloud Code of Conduct](https://eucoc.cloud/en/home) brings trust and transparency to the European cloud computing market, helping organizations to source cloud services from GDPR-compliant providers hence boosting adoption of this key innovation-friendly initiative across the EU and beyond. Commenting on the milestone Cloudflare's Chief Privacy Officer, Emily Hancock, said \"The question of how personal data is handled by cloud services and how these services comply with the GDPR remains a key concern that we hear every day when we talk with CIOs and Data Protection Officers, whether in the private or public sector.  This is why Cloudflare joined the EU Cloud Code of Conduct last May, and alongside our existing privacy certifications ISO 27701 and ISO 27018, demonstrates our commitment to the highest standards of data protection globally. Today we are proud to successfully complete our assessment journey by receiving the EU Cloud Code of Conduct compliance mark as it demonstrates our compliance with the GDPR and is an important milestone in our mission to help to build a better Internet.\"\n\nCloudflare has been audited by a 3rd-party privacy specialist as meeting this important standard. The independent auditor validated over 80 controls and their public validation report will be available shortly from the Cloudflare Trust Hub for customers, partners, and other stakeholders to download and review. The report details 47 Cloudflare products across Application and Network services, Cloudflare's developer platform Workers, Cloudflare One Zero Trust Services, Analytics, and the Cloudflare privacy and compliance portfolio including the Data Localization Suite (DLS).\n\nTo learn more about Cloudflare and its commitments to data protection and privacy in Europe, check out the resources below:\n\n- [Blog Post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-official-gdpr-code-of-conduct/)\n- [Cloudflare Trust Hub](https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/compliance-resources/)\n- [How to access compliance documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/access-compliance-docs/)\n\n__About the EU Cloud Code of Conduct__\n\nFollowing a positive opinion by the European Data Protection Board, the EU Cloud Code of Conduct was fully approved by the Belgian Data Protection Authority and is therefore a legally-operational Code of Conduct pursuant to Article 40 of the GDPR. Defining clear requirements for Cloud Service Providers to implement Article 28 GDPR, the Code covers all cloud service layers (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), has its compliance overseen by an accredited monitoring body, and represents the vast majority of the European cloud industry market share.\n\n__About Cloudflare__\n\nCloudflare, Inc.
