In this evaluation, Cloudflare received the highest scores possible in 24 criteria, including pricing flexibility and transparency. \n\nIn the Q4 2023 report, Forrester Research, Inc. evaluated 12 of the most significant vendors in the Edge Development Platform market based on 33-criteria across current offering, strategy, and market presence. Cloudflare received the highest score in the strategy category and is one of only two leaders.\n\n\"Cloudflare's global network and developer platform can provide the fastest route to innovation and the most frictionless developer experience out there. In a landscape full of vendors that lock in customers and charge outrageous egress fees, we believe that customers and analysts alike recognize us as a powerful, affordable alternative to the restrictive public cloud hyperscalers,\" said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO, Cloudflare. \"And with our recent launch of solutions to build and deploy AI-powered apps, our platform is ready to power the next generation of AI applications. We're making sure anyone around the world building AI applications has privacy, observability, and security built in.\"\n\nThe Forrester report shares: \"Cloudflare's renewed focus on unlocking a distributed cloud for development enterprises has paid off, which its industry-leading market presence reflects, with more than one million developers using the platform to deliver enterprise grade distributed applications. Several competitors building their platforms on top of Cloudflare's globally distributed cloud highlights this fact. Its superior vision refuses to limit the future footprint to the edge, and its purposeful approach to building out capabilities on the roadmap suggests that it will be increasingly well positioned to take on public cloud hyperscalers for workloads.\" \n\nMore than one million developers are building applications on Cloudflare, deploying serverless code instantly across the globe with exceptional performance, reliability, and scale. Cloudflare's Workers platform enables every developer, from enterprise companies to startups, to:\n- __Effortlessly scale:__ Developers no longer need to configure auto-scaling, load balancers, or pay for unused capacity.
