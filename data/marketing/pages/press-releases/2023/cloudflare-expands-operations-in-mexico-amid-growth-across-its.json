Mexico represents a growing Cloudflare team presence, investment in Mexican infrastructure, and focus on customers and partners in the region. Cloudflare's Mexico-based team will help the company acquire and support customers, grow brand awareness, and recruit new talent. The company first invested in Mexico when it expanded its network into Latin America in 2014 and has since been strategically placing its infrastructure close to users in the region.\n\n\"Latin American countries are some of the [largest digital populations in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262966/number-of-internet-users-in-selected-countries/) and we have seen significant innovation and business coming from Mexico. For nearly a decade, Cloudflare has been investing in Latin America, deploying our infrastructure in the region,\" said Michelle Zatlyn, Co-founder, President & COO of Cloudflare. \"Across sectors, cybersecurity and scaling operations are at the forefront. With our leading cloud connectivity services, our growing team in Mexico is committed to equipping our customers and deepening our partnerships locally.\"\n\nWith [nearly 20 percent](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/proxy) of the web running through Cloudflare's network today, the company has identified and mitigated attacks across Mexico while ensuring these Internet properties remain accessible and operate fast even amid attacks. Cybersecurity threats across the board, from phishing to DDoS attacks, are targeting businesses of all types and sizes. In the third quarter of 2023, Cloudflare blocked on average 115 million cyber threats every single day in Mexico. Analyzing sectors across the region, the top targeted industries include Telecommunications, Apparel & Fashion, Consumer Goods, Cryptocurrency, and Staffing and Recruiting. \n\nToday, Cloudflare's global network spans more than 300 cities in more than 100 countries, including more than 45 cities across Latin America and the Caribbean, like Mexico City and Queretaro, with further expansion plans.

Cloudflare has been securing, connecting, and scaling organizations across Latin America, unveiling the benefits of consolidated cloud services,\" said Carlos Torales, Head of Latin America Sales at Cloudflare. \"We are committing to Mexico's market and talent, expanding our operations amid a growing business need for Cloudflare's all-in-one solution. Organizations are operating with an increased number of applications that need to be fast and secure, regardless of where their users or employees are globally.\"\n\nMexico has one of the largest per country GDPs in Latin America and is supported by a network of international treaties such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
