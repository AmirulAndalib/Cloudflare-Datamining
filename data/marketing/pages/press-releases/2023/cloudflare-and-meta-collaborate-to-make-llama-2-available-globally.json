				"body": "__San Francisco, CA, September 26, 2023__ – [Cloudflare, Inc.](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, today announced a partnership with Meta to make the Llama 2 open source large language model (LLM) available to developers building AI applications on Cloudflare's developer platform, [Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers/). \n\nUntil recently, the only way to have access to an LLM was through calls to proprietary models. Training LLMs is a serious investment — in time, computing, and financial resources — and thus not something that's accessible to most developers. Meta's release of Llama 2, a publicly available LLM, has presented a major shift, allowing developers to run and deploy their own LLMs. However, this still requires access to, and managing, the infrastructure to run the LLM. \n\nNow, more than a million developers already building on Cloudflare have access to a leading LLM to enrich their applications. Cloudflare's hyper-distributed edge network will enable developers anywhere to build applications with Llama 2. And with Cloudflare's Data Localization Suite, they will be able to do this while controlling where their data is handled. Cloudflare's privacy-first approach to application development can help companies earn trust with their customers by ensuring data used for inference is not used for training or improving the LLM.\n\n\"Giving every developer access to Llama 2, one of the most robust LLMs to date, no configuration required, is going to propel generative AI forward in ways we've only imagined so far,\" said Matthew Prince, CEO and co-founder, Cloudflare. \"Meta has been a great contributor to the open source community, and bringing that same approach to AI is going to help ensure that powerful AI is accessible to all developers, and their communities, around the world, with data localization built in.\"\n\n__About Cloudflare__ \n\nCloudflare, Inc.
