By bringing the performance and security tools\npreviously available only to the Internet giants to anyone\nwith a website, Cloudflare is disrupting the very way in\nwhich content is made available online.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCloudflare is provisioned as a service through a simple\nchange to a website's domain settings. Cloudflare works on\nany platform, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.\nIt does not require any hardware, software, or changes to\nexisting code. Websites keep their existing hosting provider\nand infrastructure stack. Setup typically takes less than 5\n minutes. Once on the Cloudflare network, sites see an average\n30% improvement in page load times, a 60% decrease in\nbandwidth usage, and a 65% decrease in load on their server.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloudflare's core service is free. Additional services,\nsuch as SSL, realtime reports, and advanced security are\navailable for a fee beginning at $20/month. Cloudflare has\nbeen running a private beta since June and currently powers\nmore than 1,000 websites. Cloudflare's network has served\nmore than 50 million page views since the beginning of the\nprivate beta.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It is rewarding to have built a service that our users\nare already telling us they can't live without,\" said\nMichelle Zatlyn, co-founder and head of user experience.\n\"What our team is most proud about is that we have built\na service that anyone with a website can use, regardless\nof technical ability.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCloudflare's founding team originally started Project\nHoney Pot, the largest open source community tracking\nonline fraud and abuse. Cloudflare was selected from over\n1,000 promising startups that applied to launch on-stage\nat TechCrunch Disrupt. Cloudflare is based in Palo Alto,\nCalifornia and backed by leading security and networking\ninvestors from Venrock and Pelion Venture Partners.\n</p>\n<hr>\n",
