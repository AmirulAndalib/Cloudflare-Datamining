Reconciliations between historical GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained at the end of this press release following the accompanying financial data.\n\n__Financial Outlook__\n\nThe following forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook are subject to substantial uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect our estimates as of November 5, 2020 regarding the impact of the pandemic on our operations, and are highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including, among others: the duration, spread, and severity of the pandemic; actions taken by governments and businesses in response to the pandemic and the resulting impact on our customers, vendors, and partners; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity generally; our ability to continue operating in impacted areas; and customer demand and spending patterns. \n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect: \n\n- Total revenue of $117.5 to $118.5 million\n- Non-GAAP loss from operations of $10 to $9 million\n- Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.04 to $0.03, utilizing weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 304 million\n\nFor the full year fiscal 2020, we expect:\n\n- Total revenue of $422.5 to $423.5 million\n- Non-GAAP loss from operations of $38 to $37 million\n- Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.13 to $0.12, utilizing weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 300 million\n\n__Conference Call Information__\n\nCloudflare will host an investor conference call to discuss its third quarter ended September 30, 2020 earnings results today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern time). Interested parties can access the call by dialing (866) 211-4146 from the United States or (647) 689-6734 internationally with conference ID 6459727.

Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we have transitioned the method for calculating our key business metrics from a billings-based methodology to a revenue-based methodology. We believe the change in methodology to GAAP-based metrics provides improved disclosures for our investors by better aligning our key business metrics with GAAP and our financial statements and will provide a better representation of these important components of our operating model and business performance as we continue to scale. We have recast these metrics for the eight trailing quarters to reflect this new methodology in our supplemental materials.\n\n__Non-GAAP Financial Information __\n\nCloudflare believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP are included at the end of this press release following the accompanying financial data. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty of expenses that may be incurred in the future.
