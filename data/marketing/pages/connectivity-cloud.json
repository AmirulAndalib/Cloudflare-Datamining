								"shortDescription": "Leveraging unified Cloudflare services in a connectivity cloud, leading global investment and private equity firm EQT improves security, performance, accessibility, and reliability",
								"longDescription": "## __EQT reduces administrative complexity, boosts security, and streamlines development productivity with Cloudflare's connectivity cloud__\n\nFounded in 1994, and publicly listed since 2019, [EQT](https://eqtgroup.com/) is a global investment company headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. With over €100 billion in assets under management, EQT's business lines cover private equity, venture capital, infrastructure, real estate, and other sectors.  \n\nEQT's investment strategy combines sector-specific expertise (e.g. healthcare, technology, services) with thematic focuses on macro challenges, which today include climate and nature, health and wellbeing, inclusion and equality, and urbanization. Over the past five years, [EQT has continued its strong historic performance — its portfolio companies grew revenue by 17%, EBITDA by 18%, and employee count by 7% on average annually](https://eqtgroup.com/about/business-model/). In particular, its private equity business is one of the largest in the world, ranking third in Private Equity International's PEI 300 in 2023 based on capital raised over the past five years.\n\nIn 2022, EQT grew its Asian presence by acquiring Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA).  As a result of the expansion, EQT now operates in countries representing [80% of the global GDP](https://eqtgroup.com/news/2022/eqt-combines-with-bpea-to-capture-growth-opportunities-in-asia/) across Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific.\n\n### __Challenge: Securing growth — A rapidly expanding global footprint__ \n\nIn addition to expanding its global and regional presence, over the past few years, EQT completed a major cloud migration and rapidly scaled its workforce. The combined changes and growth raised the stakes for its central IT and security team, which is responsible for both protecting its employees and investors and supporting security for its portfolio companies.\n\nTo prepare for its expansion, in 2017, EQT began migrating all of its on-prem infrastructure and applications to a 100% multi-cloud architecture. To aid in scaling its [broader digital transformation goals](https://eqtgroup.com/digitalization/), EQT began to explore cloud-based security vendors. \n\nMore recently, with the 2022 BPEA EQT merger, the company's global headcount jumped from roughly 800 employees to more than 1800. In response, EQT has focused on scaling protections for EQT workers and strengthening cybersecurity across its new portfolio companies. EQT also continues to grow as a public company, increasing investor attention and regulatory scrutiny. \n\n\"The cloud migration and global expansion compelled us to reimagine our technology stack and strengthen our security posture,\" says João Pedro Gonçalves, EQT's Global Chief Information Security Officer.  \"We wanted to bring on a cloud-native security like Cloudflare that could support us on a global scale into the future.\"\n\n### __Protecting public resources and streamlining configuration__   \n\nEQT's first challenge is a common starting point for Cloudflare customers: protecting its public websites with a [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/). Gonçalves was aware of Cloudflare's strong reputation in this area and, in fact, had direct positive experiences setting up Cloudflare in prior companies and for his personal use. \n\n\"Cloudflare was the first solution we turned to. We set it up, and it worked wonderfully,\" he says. \"As engineers, we like the fact that we could just sign up and start using and testing the service without the weeks of negotiation we have experienced with other vendors.\"   \n\nThe ease of the initial WAF rollout motivated EQT to displace its incumbent vendor for [DNS record management](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/) with Cloudflare. \n\n\"We weren't looking for a new DNS management solution,\" says Kristian Petersen, EQT Group SRE Team lead, \"But we quickly recognized that we could reduce our operational complexity with Cloudflare. By putting everything in Cloudflare's connectivity cloud, we streamlined service management and improved our security by limiting the potential for human error.\"\n\nToday, Cloudflare manages 5 primary and 70 secondary domains for EQT, improves the performance of those websites with caching and dynamic content delivery via a [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/), and protects them from threats like [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/). \n\n\"Cloudflare WAF, DDoS, and DNS Management are more robust, reliable, easier to use, and throw fewer false positives than any solution I have experienced,\" says Petersen. \"Because of that, we depend more and more on Cloudflare.\"  \n\nImpressed by its early results, EQT continues to expand its use of Cloudflare applications. To transform the user experience and improve application security across its operations in China, EQT adopted the newly introduced Cloudflare China Zero Trust/WARP solution. This provides  EQT users behind the Great Firewall with protection and performant, reliable network access consistent with the rest of the company's global workforce — all on the Cloudflare platform.    \n\nEQT also leveraged the Cloudflare Developer Platform, specifically Workers, to manage caching and dynamic content delivery and further improve the performance of its public websites. In addition to providing performance benefits, the Workers configuration allows EQT to completely isolate its public websites from its cloud-hosted applications, protecting critical internal systems from potential threats.    \n\n### __Securing and scaling access to self-hosted cloud applications__\n\nEQT's cloud migration in 2017 set in motion efforts to reimagine how employees accessed internal resources.\n\nPreviously, EQT relied on traditional tools like Microsoft's on-premises Active Directory to set access policies for its on-prem apps. Complicating matters, briefly after its cloud migration, EQT relied on a mix of its own custom proxies and on-premise VPN, which were, according to Petersen, \"a lot of pain to maintain\" and \"not always secure.\" \n\nAt the same time, EQT was focusing on building its own internal applications to drive business growth, and in turn, hiring more developers who needed safe, streamlined access. One of EQT's major internal projects is [Motherbrain](https://eqtgroup.com/motherbrain/), a proprietary AI language model for identifying and analyzing investment opportunities.  \n\n\"The custom solutions we developed were fine when we had one or two local applications to protect,\" says Petersen. \"But we soon had over 20 proprietary web applications that were used every day for important work by a growing number of users. When Cloudflare showed us its portfolio of Zero Trust security services, it was exactly what we needed.\"\n\nToday, EQT protects access to all self-hosted applications for all employees and contractors using Cloudflare Access, a [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/) service. Using a secure access service edge (SASE) and secure service edge (SSE) approach, Cloudflare authenticates a request to an application only after verifying a user's identity – in this case, based on integration with EQT's identity provider, Okta. \n\nEQT's security teams value that they can strengthen security with default-deny, least-privilege policies that are consistent with [Zero Trust best practices](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/), while still streamlining the experience for their employees. \n\n\"The experience for end users is very smooth, and using a centralized service like Cloudflare to manage application access policies makes it easier for our IT and security teams,\" says Gonçalves. \"Plus, we now have visibility into who is using each of our services, which helps us improve our security holistically.\"\n\nEQT has also been able to automate the vast majority of the policy configuration process via Cloudflare [integration with Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/), the infrastructure-as-code tool. Before Cloudflare, changing or creating application access policies could take up to a full week, now the process takes five minutes.\n\n\"The time saved is a radical shift for us and allows our teams to focus on more strategic efforts,\" says Gonçalves.\n\nEQT's positive experiences with Cloudflare have encouraged the company to continue growing the partnership. The manageability, ease of implementation, user-friendly interface, and extensive functionality of the Cloudflare platform have led the company to reconsider its attitude toward consolidation. The unified Cloudflare ecosystem with its core Application Services — WAF, DDoS Protection, and DNS and Bot Management solutions — alongside the Cloudflare Developer Platform and Cloudflare Zero Trust, SASE/SSE network security have become the foundations of EQT's connectivity cloud. \n\n\"We have always taken a best-of-breed approach to our IT and security stack,\" says Gonçalves. \"We are not afraid of killing security services that don't work, but, with everything Cloudflare offers and the positive experiences we've had, we keep increasing our adoption of a unified solution.

Its technology automates accounting, payroll and payment practices. \n\nSupporting millions of businesses across 21 countries, Sage helps SMBs thrive in a complex digital landscape. The Sage ecosystem allows entrepreneurs to offload their administrative processes and free up time and resources to focus on core business objectives. Sage's purpose is to knock down barriers so everyone can thrive and good security built into the products from the outset is the foundation of this. \n\n### __Challenge: Securing business application access to millions of users__\n\nAs providers of cloud-based financial and business management tools, Sage is responsible for the security of their clients' financial information. It is a charge they take seriously, especially as online threats become more sophisticated and automated threats increase in frequency.\n\n\"A key cybersecurity focus is the rise of criminal groups that try to hold companies to ransom by making data unavailable or simply by profiting from stolen data,\" says Sage  Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Gustavo Zeidan. \"Our challenge is to protect our customers' data, as well as their own customers' data, by staying ahead in technology evolution and anticipating changes in the threat landscape — always monitoring the environment and ensuring that Sage and our customers' data stay secure.\"\n\nAs Sage's product portfolio grew, so did their need to secure and integrate their new offerings without hindering development efforts or user access to financial tools and information. \n\n\"We are constantly evolving our business processes and technology, and a significant part of that initiative involved a strong push towards a Zero Trust network architecture,\" Zeidan explains. \"We have been consistently and relentlessly decommissioning legacy ways of working and old technologies such as VPN and modernising how our business colleagues and development teams use technology to deliver their work.\" \n\nLooking for a like-minded partner dedicated to innovation, Sage chose Cloudflare to help them achieve their security and development goals.   \n\n### __Solution: Mitigating automated threats and reducing network complexity with Cloudflare integrated security and analysis tools__\n\nUsing Cloudflare, Sage was able to reduce maintenance costs and streamline their digital footprint.\n\n\"The amount of insight we gained from Cloudflare's integrated solutions such as DNS Analytics is impressive,\" says Zeidan. \"With that added visibility, we could build an understanding of our footprint at the host level and make data driven business decisions on what to keep and what to decommission, enabling us to greatly simplify our external presence.\"  \n\nSage initially had adopted the core Cloudflare application services like the Web Application Firewall (WAF) and global Content Delivery Network (CDN) to bolster product performance and secure their websites and APIs. Based on their early successes, Sage began onboarding additional Cloudflare tools — like Bot Management and DDoS mitigation — to proactively defend against threats using behavioral analysis, fingerprinting, and machine learning to monitor traffic.\n\n\"Cloudflare gives us the ability to identify what is human and what is automated traffic,\" says Zeidan. \"That helps protect our websites from automated attacks and filter out traffic when they are attempting to use our platform in a different way it was designed for.\"\n\n### __Simplifying application security and development with Cloudflare Workers__\n\nWith its comprehensive set of enterprise management tools, ensuring effortless access while maintaining stringent application security and protecting data for a user base of millions was critical to Sage's success. \n\nToday, the Cloudflare-Sage partnership extends beyond security — the Cloudflare Workers development platform gives Sage DevOps an environment in which they can innovate and safely test and deploy additional layers of code straight from the network edge.\n\n\"Cloudflare Workers has brought immense flexibility to our engineering teams,\" says Zeidan. \"This solution alone enabled operations teams to provide fast response to various architecture challenges without having to go anywhere near application code or making changes to core infrastructure.\" \n\nSage's and Cloudflare share a focus on innovation and creating solutions that bring clear benefits to their end users.\n\n\"Sage has the ambition to knock down barriers and transform the way people think and work, enabling their organisations to thrive.\" \n",

								"longDescription": "## __Polestar drives Chinese consumer confidence and scores a Super Bowl win with Cloudflare__\n\nPolestar has always focused on performance and innovation. From its roots as an automotive racing team, the organization evolved to become Volvo's performance tuning arm. Under the Volvo brand, the Polestar badge became synonymous with the Swedish manufacturer's more sporty offerings. \n\nToday, as an independent electric car manufacturer, Polestar applies its talent toward the development and manufacture of design-forward, performance-oriented luxury electric vehicles (EVs). The company's ethos— Pure Progressive Performance — is at the heart of its approach to all aspects of the business, from the cars it designs to the end-to-end customer experience it provides.\n\n### __The Challenge: Improving Chinese customer confidence, finding a strategic development partner, and ensuring highly-performant content delivery__\n\nFor automobile manufacturers, an effective digital infrastructure is central to both product performance and how customers perceive and interact with the manufacturer. Within the performance EV sector, Polestar has the mechanical pedigree, but wants to take its digital experience to the next level.   \n\n\"Polestar has a unique take on how to buy a car and it's very important to us to deliver on those expectations,\" explains Mikael Vesavuori, Cloud Software Architect and Technical Standards Lead at Polestar. \"Whether you purchase our cars online or visit one of the Polestar spaces, we tie together the physical and digital dimensions to provide a much richer retail and automotive encounter.\"\n\nOne way they achieve this is the Polestar Configurator, a central feature of Polestar's distinctive physical spaces. It is a media-rich digital and physical touchpoint that familiarizes buyers with vehicle configurations, options, and interior and exterior materials and trim. \n\nUnfortunately, the Polestar Configurator experienced performance and availability issues in China — a lucrative market where one in every five cars sold is an EV (1).\n\nAt the heart of the problem was Polestar's CDN provider, which had issues with the restrictive Chinese Internet infrastructure and connectivity problems with its global AWS network. The only solution was a partner that could overcome the latency, congestion and peering, and DNS issues that negatively affected customer perceptions of Polestar technology and the cars themselves.         \n\nIn addition to solving these issues, Polestar wanted a strategic partnership to aid along its software development roadmap. The company was developing a micro-front end architecture for its web presence that relied on multiple applications. These applications needed to interact seamlessly to provide a user experience that aligned with Polestar's brand objectives. \n\n\"We were looking for a proactive partner with developer experience, but we were sitting in meetings with vendors simply handing us documentation and saying, 'Here's how you can deal with the challenges you are facing,'\" says Johan Larsson, Technical Lead for the Polestar Platform Team.    \n\nFinally, as Polestar scaled its online and physical spaces internationally and began more proactively marketing its products, they wanted enterprise-class security and content delivery to ensure they remained performant in every imaginable scenario and market.\n\n### __The Cloudflare China Network provides world-class performance and reliability__\n\n\"It was a matter of perfect timing in a very poor situation,\" says Vesavuori, explaining Polestar's move to Cloudflare. With the current CDN partnership up for contract renewal and Chinese connectivity lagging, Polestar began researching to find the ideal solution partner. \n\n\"The list went from many names to very few,\" he explains. \"Only Cloudflare ticked all the boxes and met all of our absolute requirements for a dedicated China network — brand stability, proven reliability, and a very DevOps-oriented approach.\"\n\nAfter the switch, Polestar saw an immediate improvement in the performance of its on-site Configurator and web properties due to the Cloudflare China Network's partnership with China's largest Internet and cloud services provider, JD Cloud. The partnership provides Cloudflare clients with a geographically dispersed network presence in major cities across China to serve their static and dynamic content, and unrestricted access to Cloudflare serverless computing. \n\n\"With our previous vendor, everything was difficult to configure and troubleshoot,\" says Larsson. \"With Cloudflare, it just worked like magic. We instantly saw performance — our Chinese pages were as accessible as any other page, anywhere in the world.\"  \n\n\"Our most important gain in the move to Cloudflare China was the improvement across the board in predictability and stability. It always works,\" Vesavuori adds. \"On the customer side, that ability to deliver reliable technology ensures trust.\"\n\n### __A Super Bowl performant win with Workers and the Cloudflare global network__   \n\nIn addition to adopting the Cloudflare China Network, Polestar moved away from its underperforming cloud services and CDN  provider, switched to the Cloudflare global network for content delivery worldwide, and began web development using Cloudflare Workers serverless edge computing services.\n\nWhen it came to development, Polestar was able to rapidly migrate its entire micro-front-end architecture and applications to Workers, the Cloudflare serverless platform for running applications and code on the network edge. Cloudflare documentation, in addition to its strong online community and consultations, demos, and walkthroughs from proactive Cloudflare support teams further accelerated the transition. \n\nAnother win for the company was the ability to easily test its releases using Workers, a process Polestar previously found tedious and time-consuming. The time saved freed up Polestar's technical teams to focus on core business goals.   \n\n\"Workers was the most compatible with the tech we use to develop our applications — other vendor's solutions were abstracted in a way that made it difficult to get a sense of what would happen when we made changes,\" Larsson explains. \"Using Workers, we have granular control of everything and we can easily test to ensure our setup is correct before we release anything.\" \n\nOn the content delivery side, Polestar put the Cloudflare global network to the test when it aired the ['No Compromises'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QI0VzbkHk) commercial during Super Bowl 2022. The advertisement resulted in over 150,000 website visits — a traffic increase of almost 500 percent — in the two minutes after it aired. The site also saw an increase in long-tail traffic of around 15% for weeks following the tv commercial. \n\n\"Immediately after airing the Super Bowl commercial, viewers completed over 2000 configurations. We also saw a sales record for cars sold post event without fatal errors or us even flinching,\" says Vesavuori. \"Without Cloudflare as part of our core infrastructure, that could not have happened.\" \n\nWith 99.7% of its traffic served from the Cloudflare cache — up from a maximum of 80% percent with its previous providers — the Polestar network is faster and more resilient than ever. Cloudflare image resizing and optimization further lighten Polestar's bandwidth requirements, increase performance, and render its graphically-intensive website responsive on any device. \n\nLooking forward, Polestar intends to strengthen its partnership with Cloudflare and explore new services. The company is looking into [Cloudflare Stream](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/) for its video storage, encoding, and adaptive bitrate playback, in addition to digging deeper into Workers KV, the Cloudflare edge key-value-data storage solution.\n\n\"Cloudflare is taking steps that disrupt the traditional marketplace. It's very interesting to follow their emerging services and figure out how they will improve our next generation of applications on the edge,\" says Larsson.\n\n\"Cloudflare is Polestar's twin in the sense they are innovating and disrupting classic software development, I think our continued relationship will be one of the keys to Polestar's success,\" adds Vesavuori.   \n\n---\n[1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2021/11/13/ev-share-of-china-passenger-car-market-more-than-tripled-to-nearly-19-in-october/?sh%3D104ff31b2c21&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1652516160991840&usg=AOvVaw2g4ebZTrSyGO52TpPwqGiK)\n",
