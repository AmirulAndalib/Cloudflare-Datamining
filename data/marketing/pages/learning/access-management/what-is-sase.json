To access those\n                resources, users, branch offices, and applications connect to the data center from within a localized\n                private network or a secondary network (which typically connects to the primary one through a secure\n                leased line or <a href='/learning/access-management/what-is-a-vpn/'>VPN</a>).</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>However, this model is ill-equipped to handle the complexities introduced by new cloud-based services and the rise of\n    distributed workforces. It is impractical, for example, to reroute all traffic through a centralized data center if\n    an organization hosts <a href='/learning/cloud/what-is-saas/'>SaaS applications</a> and data in the cloud.</p>\n<p>By contrast, SASE places network controls on the cloud <a\n        href='/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-edge-computing/'>edge</a> — not the corporate data center. Instead\n    of layering services that require separate configuration and management, SASE converges network and security\n    services using one control plane. It implements identity-based, <a\n            href='/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/'>Zero Trust security</a> policies on the edge network,\n    which allows enterprises to expand network access to any remote user, branch office, device, or application.</p>\n\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Question\">\n    <h2 itemprop=\"name\">What capabilities does SASE deliver?</h2>\n    <div itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Answer\">\n        <div itemprop=\"text\">\n            <p>SASE platforms combine <a href='/learning/network-layer/network-as-a-service-naas/'>network-as-a-service\n                (NaaS)</a> capabilities with a number of security functions managed from one interface and delivered\n                from one control plane.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>These services include:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"learning-list\">\n    <li><strong>Network services that simplify connectivity</strong>, such as <a\n            href='/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-sd-wan/'>software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN)</a> or\n        WAN-as-a-service (WANaaS), to connect a variety of networks together into a single corporate network\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Security services</strong> applied to traffic flowing in and out of the network to help secure user and\n        device access, defend against threats, and protect sensitive data\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Operational services</strong> that provide platform-wide capabilities, such as network monitoring and\n        logging\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>A policy engine</strong> that underpins all contextual attributes and security rules, then applies those\n        policies across all connected services\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>By merging these services into a unified architecture, SASE simplifies network infrastructure.</p>\n\n<a id='SASEcomponents'><h2 class=\"learning-content-h2\" itemprop=\"headline\">What are the technology components of a SASE\n    platform?</h2></a>\n\n<p>Because secure access service edge involves converging a number of traditionally disparate services, organizations\n    may move towards a SASE architecture progressively, instead of all at once. Organizations can first implement the\n    components that fulfill their highest-priority <a href='#SASEusecases'>use cases</a>, before moving all networking\n    and security services to a single platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SASE platforms typically include the following technology components:</strong></p>\n\n<ul class=\"learning-list\">\n    <li><strong>Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA):</strong> The Zero Trust security model assumes threats are present\n        both inside and outside a network; therefore, strict contextual verification is required every time a person,\n        app, or device tries to access resources on a corporate network. <a\n                href='/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/'>Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)</a> is the technology\n        that makes the Zero Trust approach possible — it sets up one-to-one connections between users and the resources\n        they need, and requires periodic reverification and recreation of those connections.\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Secure web gateway (SWG):</strong> A (<a\n            href='/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/'>SWG</a>) prevents cyber threats and\n        protects data by filtering unwanted web traffic content and blocking risky or unauthorized user behavior online.\n        SWGs can be deployed anywhere, making them ideal for securing hybrid work.\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Cloud access security broker (CASB):</strong> Using the cloud and SaaS apps makes it harder to ensure\n        that data stays private and secure. A <a href='/learning/access-management/what-is-a-casb/'>CASB</a> is one\n        solution to this challenge: it provides data security controls over (and visibility into) an organization's\n        cloud-hosted services and applications.\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) or WANaaS:</strong> In a SASE architecture, organizations adopt either\n        SD-WAN or WAN-as-a-Service (WANaaS) to connect and scale operations (e.g., offices, retail stores, data centers)\n        across large distances. SD-WAN and WANaaS use different approaches:\n        <ul>\n            <li><em>SD-WAN</em> technology uses software at enterprise sites and a centralized controller to overcome\n                some of the limitations of traditional WAN architectures, simplifying operations and traffic steering\n                decisions.\n            </li>\n            <li><em>WANaaS</em> builds on the benefits of SD-WAN by taking a \"light branch, heavy cloud\" approach that\n                deploys the minimum required hardware within physical locations and uses low-cost Internet connectivity\n                to reach the nearest \"service edge\" location. This can reduce total costs, offer more integrated\n                security, improve middle mile performance, and better serve cloud infrastructure.\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    <li><strong>Next-generation firewall (NGFW)</strong> An <a\n            href='/learning/security/what-is-next-generation-firewall-ngfw/'>NGFW</a> inspects data on a deeper level\n        than a traditional firewall. For instance, NGFWs can offer application awareness and control, intrusion\n        prevention, and threat intelligence — which allows them to identify and block threats that may be hidden in\n        normal-seeming traffic. NGFWs that can be deployed in the cloud are called cloud firewalls or <a\n                href='/learning/cloud/what-is-a-cloud-firewall/'>firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS)</a>.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Depending on the vendor's capabilities, SASE components above may also be bundled with <a\n        href='/learning/email-security/what-is-email-security/'>cloud email security</a>, <a\n        href='https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-waap-named-leader-gartner-magic-quadrant-2022/'>web application and\n    API protection (WAAP)</a>, <a href='/learning/dns/dns-security/'>DNS\n    security</a>, and/or security service edge (SSE) <a\n        href='#SSEcapabilities'>capabilities</a> described further below.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"learning-content-h2\" itemprop=\"headline\">What are the key benefits of SASE?</h2>\n\n<p>SASE offers several benefits compared to a traditional, data center-based network security model.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduced risk through Zero Trust principles:</strong> SASE leans heavily on the Zero Trust security model,\n    which does not grant a user access to applications and data until their identity has been verified — even if they\n    are already inside the <a href='/learning/access-management/what-is-the-network-perimeter/'>perimeter</a> of a\n    private network. When establishing access policies, a SASE approach takes more than an entity's identity into\n    account; it can also consider factors like geolocation, device posture, enterprise security standards, and a\n    continuous evaluation of risk/trust.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduced costs through platform consolidation:</strong> SASE converges single-point security solutions into\n    one cloud-based service, freeing enterprises to interact with fewer vendors and to spend less time, money, and\n    internal resources trying to force disparate products to integrate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Operational efficiency and agility:</strong> Instead of juggling point solutions that were not designed to\n    work together, SASE enables organizations to set, adjust, and enforce security policies across all locations, users,\n    devices, and applications from a single interface. IT teams can troubleshoot more effectively and spend less time\n    resolving simple issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Improved user experience for hybrid work:</strong> Network routing optimizations can help determine the\n    fastest network path based on network congestion and other factors. SASE helps reduce end user <a\n            href='/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-latency/'>latency</a> by securely routing traffic across a\n    global edge network in which traffic is processed as close to the user as possible.</p>\n\n<a id=\"SASEusecases\"><h2 class=\"learning-content-h2\" itemprop=\"headline\">What are common SASE use cases?</h2></a>\n\n<p><strong>Augmenting or replacing VPNs for modernized secure access</strong></p>\n<p>One common driver for moving to a SASE architecture is to improve resource access and connectivity. Routing and\n    processing network traffic across a global cloud network as close to the user as possible — instead of through VPNs\n    — reduces end user friction, while eliminating the risk of <a\n            href='/learning/security/glossary/what-is-lateral-movement/'>lateral movement</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Simplifying contractor (third-party) access</strong></p>\n<p>Secure access service edge extends secure access beyond internal employees to third-parties like contractors,\n    partners, and other temporary or independent workers. With resource-based access, organizations mitigate the risk of\n    overprovisioning contractors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Threat defense for distributed offices and remote workers</strong></p>\n<p>SASE allows organizations to apply consistent IT security policies across all users, irrespective of their location.\n    By filtering and inspecting all outgoing and incoming network traffic, SASE can help prevent threats such as <a\n            href='/learning/ddos/glossary/malware/'>malware-based attacks</a>, multi-channel <a\n            href='/learning/access-management/phishing-attack/'>phishing</a> (attacks that span multiple communication\n    channels), <a href='/learning/access-management/what-is-an-insider-threat/'>insider threats</a>, data exfiltration,\n    and more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data protection for regulatory compliance</strong></p>\n<p>Because SASE provides visibility over every network request, organizations can apply policies to the data in each\n    request. These policies help ensure compliance with <a href='/learning/privacy/what-is-data-privacy/'>data\n        privacy</a> laws that require organizations to process sensitive data in certain ways.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Simplify branch connectivity</strong></p>\n<p>A SASE architecture can help augment or replace a patchwork of <a href='/learning/network-layer/what-is-mpls/'>multiprotocol\n    label switching (MPLS)</a> circuits and network appliances to more easily route traffic between branch offices, and\n    to facilitate site-to-site connectivity across locations.</p>\n\n<a id='SSEcapabilities'><h2 class=\"learning-content-h2\" itemprop=\"headline\">How are SASE and SSE (security service edge)\n    different?</h2></a>\n\n<p>Industry analyst firm Gartner defines secure access service edge as including SD-WAN, SWG, CASB, NGFW, and ZTNA to\n    \"enable zero trust access based on the identity of the device or entity, combined with real-time context and\n    security and compliance policies.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>In other words, SASE incorporates a user's secure access as part of the network architecture.</strong> <em>(It\n    is worth noting here that industry analyst firm Forrester categorizes the SASE model as \"Zero Trust Edge,\" or\n    ZTE).</em></p>\n\n<p>But not all organizations have a cohesive approach across IT, network security, and networking teams. Therefore, they\n    may prioritize <a href='/learning/access-management/security-service-edge-sse/'>security service edge (SSE)</a> — a\n    subset of SASE functionality primarily focused on securing access to the web, cloud services, and private\n    applications.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, while most SASE platforms include the <a href='#SASEcomponents'>core capabilities</a> noted earlier,\n    some include additional SSE capabilities, such as:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"learning-list\">\n    <li><a href='/learning/access-management/what-is-browser-isolation/'>Remote browser isolation (RBI):</a> RBI applies\n        the Zero Trust principle to web browsing by assuming no website code (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript) should be\n        trusted to run by default.

This separation helps prevent malware downloads, minimizes the risk of <a\n                href='/learning/security/threats/zero-day-exploit/'>zero-day</a> browser vulnerabilities, and defends\n        against other browser-borne threats\n    </li>\n    <li><a href='/learning/access-management/what-is-dlp/'>Data loss prevention (DLP):</a> To prevent data from being\n        stolen or destroyed without permission, DLP technologies detect the presence of sensitive data in web, SaaS, and\n        private applications.

This helps to pinpoint network issues and identify the root causes of connectivity anomalies\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>SSE is a common stepping stone to a full SASE deployment. However, some organizations (particularly those with mature\n    SD-WAN deployments) may not be looking to fully consolidate to a single SASE vendor. Those organizations can deploy\n    individual SASE components to address their immediate use cases, with the option to expand their platform\n    consolidation efforts over time.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"learning-content-h2\" itemprop=\"headline\">How Cloudflare enables SASE</h2>\n\n<p><a href='/cloudflare-one/' target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare One</a> is Cloudflare's SASE platform for securing enterprise\n    applications, users, devices, and networks.
