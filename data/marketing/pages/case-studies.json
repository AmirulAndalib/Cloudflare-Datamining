						"shortDescription": "Using Cloudflare as a single network entry point for its global operations, Delivery Hero reduced complexity, enhanced global network performance, and secured its international workforce and websites",
						"longDescription": "## __Delivery Hero secures its global workforce in 70+ countries with Cloudflare__\n\n[Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com/) is on a mission \"to deliver anything, straight to customers' doors.\" Today, the company is the world's leading local delivery platform, connecting customers in over 70 countries across four continents with an ecosystem of restaurants, shops, retail partners, and 'Dmarts,' its self-branded, delivery-only supermarkets. \n\nThe company manages a portfolio of international and regional brands like [efood](https://www.e-food.gr/), [foodora](https://www.foodora.com/), [foodpanda](https://www.foodpanda.com/), [foody](https://www.foody.com.cy), [Glovo](https://glovoapp.com/), [HungerStation](https://hungerstation.com/), [PedidosYa](https://www.pedidosya.com/), [talabat](https://www.talabat.com/) and [Yemeksepeti](https://www.yemeksepeti.com/), and is also a global pioneer of q-commerce — online sales and ultra-fast logistics services that deliver goods in under an hour.  \n\nFounded in 2011 in Berlin with an initial team of 10, Delivery Hero now hires employees across 4 continents, in over 70+ countries and has been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 2017.\n\n### __Challenge: Rising IT & security complexity driven by rapid growth__\n\nFor Delivery Hero, rapid growth had introduced complexities and challenges for its IT and security approach. Between 2016 and 2020, the company grew its workforce from ~9,000 to ~30,000 employees, and over that time, expanded their global reach through various strategic mergers and acquisitions. Keeping pace with onboarding new users and integrating new companies with different tech stacks was increasingly taxing for Delivery Hero's internal teams.\n\n\"With so many different new people and infrastructures to manage, the complexity added up,\" explains Wilson Tang, Director of Engineering, Platform Core Services at Delivery Hero. \"That limited how efficiently we could innovate. To move quickly, we needed tools to help us get that complexity under control.\" \n\nThe shift to remote work in 2020 placed even greater demands on security, forcing Delivery Hero to manage an expanded attack surface and stay vigilant against a rise in cyber threats. Ensuring safe and productive access for employees to internal resources became a top priority.\n\n\"When we adopted work-from-home and hybrid work models around the world, we needed to protect applications designed for access only on our internal office networks,\" says Tang. \"Securing everything and giving employees access from home, or anywhere else they chose to work, became much more challenging and complex.\"\n\nTo tame this complexity, Delivery Hero has adopted [Cloudflare's connectivity cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/), which converges many services companies need to secure and protect their digital environments. Specifically, Delivery Hero has progressively consolidated more security, performance, and developer functionality, onto Cloudflare's control plane, including:\n\n- Securing access to internal resources with Zero Trust\n- Improving security and performance across public-facing apps and websites\n- Streamlining the development and configuration of apps\n\n\"Cloudflare's connectivity cloud is helping us manage complexity across our global operations and has made our lives so much easier,\" says Tang.  \n\n### __Securing internal access to support hybrid work__ \n\nDelivery Hero, which had always prioritized cloud-native security tools, first turned to Cloudflare to secure access to internal applications. Specifically, Tang and his team began evaluating Cloudflare One, a [Security Services Edge (SSE)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/security-service-edge-sse/) platform that includes a [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/) service to secure remote access. \n\nPreviously, Delivery Hero had relied on a VPN solution, but had found the technology inefficient to manage and slow for end users. In testing Cloudflare, they focused first on applying identity-based checks for web apps – a common initial use case that does not require deploying any device client software.\n\n\"From the beginning, Cloudflare impressed us with its ease and speed of deployment,\" says Tang. \"Protecting an application takes maybe five minutes, and I can skip the pain points of setting up access with traditional VPNs.\"\n\nOver time, the company has scaled its deployment across more users and more applications, including key developer tools and backend customer systems. Today, Delivery Hero uses Cloudflare to secure access for over 40,000 employees to all applications across self-hosted, SaaS, and non-web environments. Enforcing [single sign-on](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sso/) identity checks has helped Delivery Hero both improve its security posture with [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/) best practices and streamline the experience for end users.\n\n\"With Cloudflare, our employees can access the tools they need to get their jobs done without extra security hassle or connectivity issues,\" says Tang. \n\nAdopting Cloudflare has helped Delivery Hero scale more efficiently by simplifying the process of onboarding new employees and consolidating access policies on a single platform. This has freed up time and energy for Delivery Hero's technical staff to focus on innovation rather than administration.\n\n\"Being able to onboard new teams quickly and easily shift our new brands onto a consolidated, easily administered platform like Cloudflare improved our efficiency and time-to-market with new products,\" says Tang. \"Speed of innovation is everything in the tech industry, and by simplifying operations using Cloudflare we can iterate and create service and value improvements that keep our customers from turning to our competitors.\"\n\n### __Securing and improving performance of public-facing websites__ \n\nAfter simplifying its security approach for internal resources, Delivery Hero began a similar process for security across its public-facing resources, which include websites, desktop and mobile customer apps, and vendor-facing administrative portals. \n\nWith its large online footprint and high volume of transactions processed, Delivery Hero has consistently been an attractive target for attackers, particularly as the company has grown. These attacks risked eroding customer trust, and mitigating them took time and energy away from staff.\n\n\"We faced every type of attack you can imagine,\" says Tang. \"DDoS attacks and bots brute forcing our endpoints, and deliberate, for-profit credential stuffing, account takeovers, and voucher, identity, and credit card fraud attempts against our customer and vendor portals.\" \n\nTo address these risks, Delivery Hero has secured all its public-facing apps and websites with Cloudflare's [Application Services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/). Security capabilities such as [web application firewalls](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/), [DDoS mitigation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-mitigation/), [DNS management](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/), and [bot management](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-bot-management/) help Tang's staff regain visibility and protection over their expanding footprint of digital properties.\n\n\"Due to their technical advancement, you cannot stop the bot attacks without the observability of a tool like Cloudflare,\" says Tang. \"Using Cloudflare for visibility, we can query malicious traffic, identify the attack patterns, and use that intel to develop solutions to mitigate them.\" \n\nAdopting Cloudflare's Application Services has also helped Delivery Hero more efficiently manage global demand across its websites.\n\n\"We see traffic spikes year-round across regions because of different holidays, marketing activity, or annual festivals.\" says Tang. \"It is not unusual for us to see a 3x traffic surge in one country, and a 10x burst in another the following day.\" \n\nUsing Cloudflare, Delivery Hero has insulated itself against these demand spikes, whether expected or unexpected, and is able to deliver consistently high-speed experiences for their customers year-round. Tang estimates that using the Cloudflare connectivity cloud has reduced latency, slashed Delivery Heroes' bandwidth costs by 90%, and helped the company achieve a cache hit rate of 98.5% for its vast library of product images and other online assets. \n\n\"Cloudflare's global network and cache reserve have reduced our infrastructure costs and improved our image and static asset delivery times,\" says Tang. \"The savings are huge, several petabytes per month.\"\n\n### __Securing and streamlining development__\n\nOne final area where consolidating onto Cloudflare's connectivity cloud has helped Delivery Hero is with making development safer and easier. \n\nFor example, Delivery Hero has mandated that all new features for websites and apps are built with Cloudflare's security protections. \n\n\"Cloudflare is so secure and so easy to use we have made it a compulsory tool for our development teams,\" says Tang. \"Whenever we develop a new API endpoint, it must be behind Cloudflare, so we can properly protect and manage it.\"\n\nDelivery Hero also uses Cloudflare Workers, a developer platform to build and deploy serverless applications and functions. By configuring changes on Workers, Tang and his team can scale those changes across Delivery Hero's application footprint with speed.\n\n\"Cloudflare Workers is so easy to deploy. In minutes, we can make changes, create third-party integrations, or onboard new technologies that would otherwise take us hundreds of hours of development and testing,\" says Tang.\n\nThroughout the years tackling various use cases with Cloudflare, Tang has had a positive experience.\n\n\"Cloudflare has supported us every step of the way. From our account managers and customer success agents to Cloudflare technical support, somebody is always on hand to help us achieve our business goals.\"  \n",

EPAM delivers globally, but engages locally with their expert teams of consultants, architects, designers and engineers, making the future real for their clients, their partners and their people around the world. They believe the right solutions are the ones that improve people's lives and fuel competitive advantage for their clients across diverse industries. \n\n\"Our Digital Platform enhances the agility within our business divisions, facilitating swift adoption and adjustment to the ever-changing business landscape. It's designed to improve comprehensive business procedures across EPAM within days, not months,\" said Valerii Nikitin, Senior Director of Delivery Management at EPAM. \n\nEPAM wanted their experienced and skilled development teams to be flexible in their technical decisions, while ensuring high security and seamlessly integrating cutting-edge, off-the-shelf solutions, irrespective of the particular hyperscale platforms utilized.\n\n### __Challenge: Enhance the performance and security of EPAM's digital ecosystem to keep pace with rapidly expanding global user base__\n\nEPAM strives to ensure that all users, regardless of where they are, receive services of the same high quality and speed. Considering all the complexity EPAM wanted to unify and strengthen the connectivity and security of its Digital Platform by leveraging Cloudflare's connectivity cloud.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide the best possible user experience to every end-user — an experience unaffected by geography or other factors,\" said Dzmitry Naskou, CTO, Digital Platform, EPAM. \"We always look ahead to tomorrow's challenges, so as our user base became more globally distributed and more demanding, we decided to meet their expectations head-on by aligning ourselves with the latest advancements of the Cloudflare connectivity cloud and its global network.\"\n\n### __Solution: Enabling CDN and security on a connectivity cloud__\n\nBased on positive industry feedback, available capabilities and in-depth interactions with the Cloudflare team, EPAM selected the Cloudflare connectivity cloud to consolidate and securely expose their applications ecosystem.\n\n\"We began with the Cloudflare CDN and Cloudflare WAF, as well as Cloudflare Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection to enhance our user experience and overall application performance,\" said Naskou. \"Now the Cloudflare connectivity cloud covers our entire internal ecosystem — almost 200 applications and services with users worldwide — 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\"\n\nBy enabling Cloudflare, EPAM saw page load times improve by 20%, however the improvement was more significant for the users located in more distant regions from EPAM's collocated infrastructure.\n\n\"Our users across the Americas, EMEA and APAC saw the largest improvements with a cache hit ratio of over 45%,\" said Naskou.\n\nUsing Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) to connect and secure its internal services EPAM has also simplified the administration and maintenance of EPAM's Digital Platform under a centralized platform.\n\n\"We wanted a solution where a dedicated security team could manage, monitor, and analyze all our applications without embedding an expert into each of our development teams,\" said Naskou. \"The Cloudflare connectivity cloud allowed us to build a secure environment we can control from a single window.\"\n\nThe Cloudflare platform allowed EPAM to expose applications and manage Web Application Firewall in one place, despite operating within a complex development ecosystem that spans all major cloud platforms as well as private cloud infrastructure.\n\nAfter addressing that challenge, EPAM set its sights on further enhancing its digital platform's performance, security and functionality.\n\n### __Challenge: Provide secure access and the best user experience for all users regardless of their permissions, geographical location, and other factors__\n\nEPAM's user base is diverse: employees, clients, business partners have access to EPAM digital ecosystem, as well as community members, students, public users. These users are part of EPAM business processes and thus they have fine-grained access to applications according to their roles.\n\n### __Solution: Unified authentication gateway using Cloudflare Workers__\n\n\"We see authentication service as microservice of each application that should run as close to the end user as possible to enhance our user experience regardless of the cloud provider, application platform or technology in use,\" said Naskou.\n\nCloudflare developer platform provides flexibility to build custom solutions on top of Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, and Workers KV. With their help, EPAM has built a custom authentication gateway service and seamlessly integrated it with existing access management capabilities. It allows EPAM to enforce user authentication when necessary; manage, verify, refresh, and exchange JWT tokens; enhance user session management; control every single request to apps and between apps in a multi-cloud setup.\n\nWith all that said, using a built-with-Cloudflare solution, EPAM can now  manage policies for all types of users, applications and services in one place, supporting formerly difficult hybrid user access models that provide appropriate levels of application security to its public and authenticated internal users alike.\n\n### __Challenge: Enhance the performance of API calls__\n\nThe majority of EPAM services are corporate business applications that provide highly personalized content, business and operational data to the served users. 85% of user requests are API calls with dynamic data that depends on user context such as roles, permissions, and other factors.\n\n### __Solution: Application gateway with advanced caching capabilities__\n\n\"Leveraging Workers and the Cloudflare cache API, we created a gateway that further improves the performance of our web applications,\" said Naskou. \"By utilizing Cloudflare Workers and the Cloudflare Cache API, we're able to constantly evaluate user requests and their specific contexts to anticipate subsequent queries. This predictive approach allows us to pre-fetch data and establish a private, user-specific cache and store dynamic data close to the user's location for optimal performance.\"\n\nEPAM boosted the performance of dynamic requests by an additional 15% by implementing API call prefetching, which anticipates and prepares responses for the subsequent API calls in advance.\n\n### __Conclusion__\n\n\"Engineering is at the core of what we do. By leveraging technology transformation, we guide our customers through successive waves of innovation, helping them thrive in the marketplace amid ongoing technological and social changes,\" said Nikitin. \"We partnered with Cloudflare not just for the high-quality services and robust capabilities it offers, but also because it gives us an excellent platform flexible for innovation and transformation.\"\n\nAs an organization that strives to redefine technology and give its customers a technological advantage, EPAM expects the same drive from the solutions it partners with. EPAM and Cloudflare share a passion for innovation that works to their mutual benefit.\n",

						"shortDescription": "Loyalty Status Co accelerates international growth and adapts to the dynamic market demands of the international travel loyalty industry with Cloudflare",
						"longDescription": "## __Accelerating growth — Loyalty Status Co scales and secures its international client base with the Cloudflare connectivity cloud, saving up to $18 for every dollar spent__\n\nFounded by a trio of former airline executives, Loyalty Status Co is revolutionizing how the airline, hospitality, and loyalty industries engage and retain customers. Since its inception in 2020, the company has forged an extensive network of partnerships with the world's most recognizable airline, hotel, and retail brands.\n\nAs the creators of [powerful customer acquisition tools](https://www.loyaltystatus.com/#solutions) like the [StatusMatch](https://www.statusmatch.com), StatusBooster subscription, StatusLift, and GetStatus card-match platforms, Loyalty Status Co has been featured in major media like the New York Times, Condé Nast, WSJ, and CNN Travel. The company has also received industry-based recognition as the [World Aviation Festival](https://worldaviationfestival.com/) Start-Up winner and [Loyalty and Awards](https://www.loyalty-and-awards.com/) Innovation Supplier of the Year finalist.\n\n### __Building a robust, scalable, user-friendly, and centrally managed global infrastructure__\n\nIn three short years, Loyalty Status Co transitioned from a startup into the preferred loyalty and rewards program partner for major international airlines and hotel chains. Operating in a highly regulated industry reliant on consumer data and personally identifiable information (PII) to deliver services, the company's rapid growth created a host of challenges for its IT and security teams. These challenges focused on ensuring a secure and responsive user experience for its expanding roster of partners and their program members.\n\n\"As our company expanded and we partnered with some globally recognizable airlines, our network, infrastructure, and performance capabilities had to grow, and fast,\" explains Mark Sly, Loyalty Status Co's CTO. \"Data security was our paramount concern. We needed to secure user information, automate complex security tasks, and optimize our services while aligning with stringent industry security standards, including ISO 27001 certification.\"\n\nAfter an unsuccessful experiment using an AWS solution and custom code to achieve its goals, Loyalty Status Co turned to Cloudflare to secure and protect its digital environments. Unlike its prior attempts, [Cloudflare's connectivity cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/) offered the company a consolidated solution with a single control plane to help it accomplish the following objectives:\n\n- Align with the international security standards governing its airline and travel industry partners.\n- Mitigate evolving online security threats to secure application and customer data.\n- Ensure the reliability and speed of customer applications.\n- Adapt to the diverse technology stacks and requirements of its international client base.\n\n\"All of our early approaches lacked scalability and were a challenge to manage globally. They didn't have the comprehensive features we needed, and that increased our development overheads,\" says Sly. \"With the airline and travel industry facing daily data security and privacy threats, our need for a scalable, user-friendly alternative with robust features and centralized management drove our transition to Cloudflare.\"\n\n### __Solution: Securing and scaling digital environments with Cloudflare__\n\nLoyalty Status Co immediately recognized the benefits of using Cloudflare to protect both its clients' and its own public infrastructure. Transitioning to Cloudflare, the company was able to support rapid business growth, seamlessly securing the loyalty program domain and applications of Frontier Airlines, its first major airline partner.\n\n\"From the beginning, Cloudflare's user-friendly interface and built-in features streamlined the adoption process,\" says Sly. \"As we increased in size, revenue, and value to our clients, our requirements changed and our infrastructure matured. Cloudflare became a critical infrastructure partner by enabling that growth.\"\n\n### __Aligning with international security standards and securing customer confidence__\n\nProviding software as a service (SaaS) in the data-sensitive loyalty services and consumer travel space, Loyalty Status Co relies on the trust of its airline partners. Obtaining [ISO/IEC 27001 Certification](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001), the global standard for information security management, was pivotal in building that trust and driving the company's growth within the travel industry. Cloudflare played a key role in identifying and addressing security risks and weaknesses within Loyalty Status Co's infrastructure, aligning with the rigorous requirements for certification.\n\"Cloudflare has helped both directly and indirectly with our ISO 27001 journey, especially the process of educating our organization and bringing our network up to industry standards,\" says Sly. \"Our partnership with Cloudflare increases our airline clients' confidence. They understand the level of security Cloudflare delivers, and that saves us time on reviews and audits.\"\n\n### __Adapting to diverse technology requirements across a diverse international client base__\n\n[Cloudflare for SaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/saas/) has allowed Loyalty Status Co to leverage the entire suite of performance and security tools in the connectivity cloud to deliver fast, secure, centrally managed, and reliable experiences to its clients and their end users on a global scale. Alongside a fortified security position and immediate scalability, Cloudflare also enables Loyalty Status Co to offer customized tech stacks and adapt to regional differences — all without diluting performance and security or adding to development and administrative overheads.\n\n\"As a centralized, intuitive platform for testing and deploying solutions, Cloudflare saves us time and money,\" says Sly. \"Cloudflare's user-friendly interface and pre-built features streamline our processes, eliminating the need for extensive custom development. This agility allows us to deploy effective solutions quickly, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing associated costs.\"\n\nSly estimates that for every dollar Loyalty Status Co spends on Cloudflare services, it saves $18 through automation and resource allocation improvements — a very significant ROI of 1800%.\n\n\"Because all of Cloudflare's products are easy to use, vendor management was much less of a burden, especially in our startup phase,\" he says. \"All Cloudflare products are vertically integrated in a single place, so stuff just works.\"\n\n### __Mitigating evolving online security threats to secure application and customer data__\n\nLeveraging Cloudflare for SaaS across its entire customer base, Loyalty Status Co secures customer applications and [APIs](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/api-security/) across multiple threat scenarios using the [Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/), [Advanced Rate Limiting](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/rate-limiting/), and [DDoS protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/) from a single control plane.

						"longDescription": "## __SHOPLINE maintains merchant website security and ensures site performance for global merchants with Cloudflare__\n\nFounded in 2013, SHOPLINE is one of Asia's largest and fastest growing commerce Software-as-a-service and solution providers. The SHOPLINE platform offers a rich ecosystem of technologies, resources and partners that empowers merchants to succeed. Merchants leverage SHOPLINE's omnichannel solutions for e-commerce, social commerce and point-of-sales to sell their products and services around the world.\nSHOPLINE is headquartered in Singapore with about 2000 employees operating globally.\n\n### __Challenge: Bolstering intentional network performance and security while managing client SSL certificates at scale__\n\nAs an international ecommerce platform operating under a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, providing a top-notch user experience for its merchants at both the business (B2B) and merchant (B2C) levels is crucial to SHOPLINE's success. \n\nFor its merchants, this means guaranteeing secure, fast-performing services across nearly unlimited custom domains. As SHOPLINE grew, the logistics of administering and maintaining a rapidly growing number of white-label private websites — each requiring its own security certificate — became a logistical challenge.\n\n\"As we took on more merchant clients, we exposed the shortcomings of our original technical DNS and SSL management implementation,\" says George Wu, SHOPLINE's Operations Manager. \"The cost and sheer effort involved in maintaining tens of thousands of SSL certificates for our business' domains skyrocketed, making it difficult to focus on product growth.\"  \n\nOn the merchant side, performance was at the top of SHOPLINE's list of concerns. With merchant users distributed globally, the merchant sites SHOPLINE hosted frequently experienced location-based performance issues.\n\n\"To provide our international merchants with a stable user experience and a frictionless onboarding process, we needed an access layer network with the widest possible coverage area,\" explains Wu. \"In the early stages of our growth, creating a reliable performance solution on our own was an unrealistic technical and financial challenge.\"\nThe sheer scope of SHOPLINE's international operations is at the heart of the platform's other core challenge — securing merchants, merchants, and its data centers against online threats like DDoS attacks, SQL injections, credential stuffing, and inventory hoarding bots. [Stopping these threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) was critical to avoiding data leaks and service disruptions while maintaining merchant trust.\n\n\"Cyber security has been a constant battle between attackers and our safety teams,\" says Wu. \"To maintain an effective security barrier against sophisticated threats on the public Internet, we needed to dedicate significant time and keep costly resources on alert against unexpected attacks.\"\n\n### __Frictionless merchant onboarding and SSL certificate maintenance with Cloudflare SSL for SaaS__\n\nEvaluating the alternatives, only Cloudflare offered the balance of efficacy and affordability SHOPLINE was looking for. SHOPLINE turned to the Cloudflare connectivity cloud, a single-vendor solution that offered [performance and security](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) while simplifying SSL management issues. \n\n\"Cloudflare and its security teams have proven their expertise time and time again, most recently by thwarting [HTTP/2 Rapid Reset](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2023/cloudflare-helps-discover-new-online-threat-that-led-to-largest-attack-in/),  the world's largest global cybersecurity attack to date,\" says Wu. \"Because Cloudflare only charges us for our traffic and we don't need to invest in additional hardware or personnel, it is our ideal security partner.\"\n\nWith customizable domain configurations, rapid global SSL deployments, and SSL lifecycle management features, Cloudflare SSL for SaaS was practically tailor-made for SHOPLINE's needs. SSL for SaaS simplified SHOPLINE's merchant onboarding and enhanced the platform's ability to provide the branded visitor experiences its merchants demanded.\n\n\"Cloudflare removed the friction from our merchant intake process,\" says Wu. \"Our in-house solution took a vendor at least seven steps to link and provision a store. Integrating SSL for SaaS reduced that to three.\"\n\nBesides streamlining its merchant-facing onboarding process, SSL for SaaS' automated SSL lifecycle management reduces SHOPLINE's administrative workloads, minimizes operational costs, and ensures expired security certificates do not catch the company by surprise. The company also uses SSL for SaaS to guarantee its own domains — like [shopline.com](http://shopline.com), [myshopline.com](http://myshopline.com), [oneship.io](http://oneship.io) and regional variants like [shopline.hk](http://shopline.hk), and [shopline.my](http://shopline.my), — are always secure and up to date.   \n\n### __Raising the bar on public Internet threat management with the Cloudflare WAF__\nUsing Cloudflare application services, specifically threat intelligence provided by the easy-to-deploy [Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/), SHOPLINE secures its visitors, merchants, websites, [APIs](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/api-security/), and data centers against automated threats on the public Internet. Blocking nearly 80 million monthly threats across SHOPLINE's corporate and merchant-branded sites, Cloudflare gives the platform the performance and resiliency to withstand sophisticated and brute-force bot attacks.   \n\n\"Cloudflare has raised the bar on how much malicious traffic our sites can withstand,\" says Wu. \"No matter how severe the attack is, Cloudflare identifies the source and automatically implements measures to protect our back-end services — after that it is business as usual, we don't need to do anything.\"\n\nPreviously, the company had a paid emergency team on standby. Using Cloudflare, SHOPLINE has re-assigned those resources to feature creation and business development roles.\n\n\"Cloudflare saves us time and money, and we are more protected against unexpected incidents than ever before,\" says Wu.\n\n### __Improving the end-user experience in the connectivity cloud__\n\nBecause online merchants are becoming increasingly intolerant of performance delays and poor page load times, SHOPLINE needed a network infrastructure and content delivery partner that could offer a consistent user experience to all website visitors, anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Cloudflare global network — offering 310 points of presence across 120 countries and connections to 13,000 major service and cloud providers worldwide — was the solution the company needed. Using the Cloudflare connectivity cloud to cache static content and circumvent congestion by avoiding network hops and optimizing traffic paths, SHOPLINE has drastically reduced latency and improved its application performance and end-user experience.\n\n\"With the Cloudflare global network's edge nodes in every country and territory our vendors do business, the unparalleled level of coverage guarantees that our merchants in every corner of the globe receive 'last mile' quality site performance,\" says Wu.\n\n### __Accelerated page load and rendering times with the Cloudflare developer platform__\nWorkers, Workers KV, and the Cloudflare Developer Platform are the last pieces of the performance improvement puzzle for SHOPLINE, its merchants, and the merchants who shop using its sites. By allowing SHOPLINE to deploy serverless applications that run on the point of presence nearest the merchant, Workers and Workers KV are invaluable for speeding up the delivery of dynamic and regional-specific content, and improving page load and rendering times. \n\n\"Workers enhance the browsing, shopping, and checkout experience by accelerating how we present content and perform on-page calculations like shopping cart totals, local taxes, and currency conversions,\" says Wu. \"The time savings and performance improvements we see using Cloudflare help to keep merchants engaged and reduce instances of page and cart abandonment.\"      \n\nSummarizing SHOPLINE's three-year engagement with Cloudflare, Wu concludes:  \n\n\"Since day one, we have received so much assistance and support from Cloudflare. It is a partnership that provides better, safer, and more simplified service for every SHOPLINE user.\" \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Automating security — GMO Internet Group mitigates DDoS threats and malicious bot attacks with Cloudflare__\nThe GMO Internet Group provides customers with a broad variety of services, ranging from Internet infrastructure, SSL management, web hosting, and domain registration to advertising and media, crypto assets and finance. Since 1995, the company has grown exponentially — encompassing over 103 companies and providing contracted services to over 15 million clients in 20 countries worldwide\n\nBecause of its rapid growth, the GMO Internet Group is a mainstay of the Japanese Internet and communications ecosystem, providing, according to its slogan, \"Internet for All.\" The company has also formed a series of international subsidiaries like [Z.com](https://z.com/) and [GMO GlobalSign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlobalSign) that extend its operations to Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Korea, and Vietnam.\n\n### __Challenge: Addressing increasingly sophisticated, large-scale Internet threats__\n\nWith a highly diverse portfolio of products and services, data security and customer trust are central to GMO Internet Group's success. As the company and its subsidiaries grew, however, finding an efficient, cost-effective way to secure its public-facing websites, [APIs](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/api-security/), endpoints, and data centers became problematic, especially with Internet-borne attacks increasing in both scale and sophistication. Performance drops and potential service outages due to DDoS threats, bots, and attackers jeopardized the company's ability to provide a frictionless customer experience.  \n\n\"Our existing WAF solution was cumbersome — updating and propagating new WAF rules required substantial operational time and effort while offering limited protection,\" explains Rei Hasegawa, Executive Lead, Project Management Team, Infrastructure and Operation Division, System Division, GMO Internet Group. \"We realized that for truly responsive, real-time protection against Internet-based threats, we needed the advanced countermeasures only a cloud-based WAF could provide.\"\n\n### __Solution: Enhanced security and a seamless implementation process__\n\nThe GMO Internet Group conducted extensive research, establishing proofs of concept (POCs) to evaluate WAF solutions from the top vendors in the cyber security and content delivery marketplace. After multiple trials, the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall stood out above the alternatives. \n\nThe cornerstone of Cloudflare's [application services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/), the [Cloudflare WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/), provides GMO Internet Group with comprehensive website, API, and [application security](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) on the global network. Cloudflare gives GMO Internet Group granular control over its web security and allows it to thwart malicious bot, DDoS, and zero-day attacks on the network edge without requiring expensive and difficult-to-maintain on-site hardware.\n\nThe Cloudflare WAF provides machine learning, threat intelligence insights, and central security management for all GMO Internet Group's international subsidiary domains. It is also able to fine-tune security with Cloudflare's managed rules, Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) rule sets, and powerful manual response options. \n\n\"We can control web traffic site by site, and evaluate the efficacy of our WAF rules in real time,\" says Hasegawa. \"Cloudflare's detailed logging and security analytics gave us the insights and confidence we needed to take the WAF live at scale, and our deployment went seamlessly, with no problems.\"  \n\n### __Automated threat detection and mitigation reduces operational burdens__\n\nThe low-maintenance, centrally-administered Cloudflare WAF substantially decreased the workload of GMO Internet Group engineers, IT technicians, and support desk staff, eliminating the need for third-party WAF maintenance. \n\n\"Even though we outsourced management responsibilities for our legacy WAF, we still needed to dedicate significant internal resources daily to scrutinize security events, and deal with each new incident case-by-case,\" says Hasegawa. \"Using Cloudflare, we have automated and improved our threat detection accuracy. Managing security for each site internally from a single control plane minimizes the operational burdens on our support staff, reducing problem reports and freeing our technical teams to focus on service improvements rather than fighting fires.\" \n\nWith Cloudflare effortlessly [mitigating threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) to the company's websites, endpoints, and applications, GMO Internet Group enjoys reduced bandwidth costs and improved server availability.\n\n### __Enhancing network performance with Workers and the Cloudflare developer platform__\n\nThe GMO Internet Group achieves additional security and performance gains using the Cloudflare developer platform. With [Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/), Cloudlfare's highly configurable, edge-based application development platform, The GMO Internet Group can run its domestic Japanese and international products near the customer on Cloudflare's global network. This reduces latency and page load times, enhancing the customer experience. \n\nCloudflare's extensive network of data centers throughout Asia — including four prominent locations in Japan — helped drive GMO Internet Group's partnership decision.\n\n\"Workers gives us flexible control over our web applications and allows us to leverage open technologies like JavaScript/Typescript on the global network,\" says Hasegawa. \"Cloudflare points of presence in Japan and around the world are so well-developed, Cloudflare was the obvious choice.\"  \n\n### __Exceptional customer service and future plans__\nGMO Internet Group is an organization that provides top-notch customer service to companies around the world. In Cloudflare, it found a service partner who shared its customer-first priorities — and exceeded its high expectations. \n\n\"Cloudflare provides us with a level of support we have experienced nowhere else,\" says Hasegawa, \"It always responds immediately to difficult technical inquiries and arranges regular meetings to follow up on the performance of our Cloudflare services.\"  \n\nBased on positive outcomes, GMO Internet Group plans to onboard more Cloudflare solutions, enhancing its current DDoS protection with Cloudflare [Magic Transit](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/) and securing employees and internal resources with the Cloudflare [Zero Trust and the SASE and SSE Platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/). \n",

						"shortDescription": "Konoike Transport uses Cloudflare to secure its international staff and customer communications against viruses and socially engineered, email-borne threats.",
						"longDescription": "## __Konoike Transport secures international inboxes and reduces operational and administrative  burdens with Cloudflare__\n\nFormed in 1880 and incorporated in 1945, the KONOIKE Group is a professional organization that continually challenges itself to solve society's problems and innovate, going beyond the boundaries of logistics and expanding into manufacturing, medical, airport operations,\nand more.\n\nThe company has approximately 14,000 employees (24,000 on a consolidated basis as of March 31, 2023), 186 offices in Japan and 33 overseas. They have defined their medium-term business plan between FY23 and FY25 as \"Pursue Innovation\", and they engage to solving social problems through utilizing technology, DX, and collaborative business.\n\n### __A rising tide of sophisticated email-borne threats__\n\nWith a widely distributed global footprint, Konoike Transport relies heavily on email to exchange important information. Despite the efficacy of email for company communications, Konoike Transport experienced an increase in hostile parties using the medium as an attack vector to distribute malware and ransomware, phish for user credentials, or exploit employee inboxes for fraudulent purposes.  In a month they would receive about 30 internal inquiries that would take an excessive amount of time to respond and resolve.\n\nTo mitigate these risks while upgrading its existing email infrastructure under the Overseas Email Environment Integration Project, Konoike Transport began an internal security review. The company's goal was to secure its communications, particularly as new variants of the [Emotet Trojan](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-280a) malware campaign and a rising number of [Business Email Compromise (BEC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) attacks began appearing frequently in Konoike Group employees' inboxes.\n\n\"Although we were using a well-known email security software for protection, emails containing viruses, socially engineered content, and malicious code were slipping through the cracks regularly,\" explains Masaya Sato, General Manager of the Digital Transformation Promotion Department, ICT Promotion at Konoike Transport. \"As the emails became increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, the fear of intrusion and a heightened awareness of the importance of email security within the company led to a sharp increase in reports of suspicious emails to our help desk.\" \n\n### __Cloud Email Security for global high-accuracy, low-touch employee and customer protection__\n\nEvaluating best-in-breed email solutions from established cyber security vendors, Konoike Transport was unable to find a solution that matched its requirements — until Cloudflare.\n\n\"Only Cloudflare offered an easy-to-install and configure solution while providing advanced functionality to analyze, identify, and accurately protect us against threats,\" says Satoshi Tomatsu, Digital Transformation Promotion Department, ICT Promotion Division at Konoike Transport. \n\nBuilding upon the Cloudflare [SSE and SASE platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/), [Cloudflare's Cloud Email Security](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/) provided Konoike Transport with the low-touch, high-efficacy threat detection solution it needed to isolate malicious content. A Cloudflare Zero Trust product, Cloud Email Security secured the Konoike Group against sophisticated BEC, phishing and credential harvesting, and ransom and malware threats designed to evade traditional detection techniques.\n\n\"After a painless implementation, Cloudflare secured the Konoike Group, blocking over 80,000 malicious emails monthly — it accurately detects and quarantines threats before they become a problem,\" says Tomatsu. \"With Cloudflare protecting our inboxes, the number of email-related problem reports and support requests our IT department receives has dropped to one or less from over 30 per month — a 97% decrease.\"\n\n### __Distributing the administrative burden of multi-language, multi-domain threat detection__\n\nFor the Konoike Group, the Overseas Email Environment Integration Project was a massive undertaking affecting every department and employee in the organization. With Cloudflare's assistance, the company completed the project in two phases. For Phase 1, the company deployed Cloudflare Email Security as a single tenant for the entire group companies' email. This provided email transport and security services for all the company's subsidiaries and overseas entities. \n\nWith its core email infrastructure complete, the Konoike Group then provided each entity with [email services](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/email-security-services/) under its own domain. Upon evaluation of it being successful, they split \nthe single tenant to multi-tenants.By using Cloudflare's highly configurable Cloud Email Security and managing its domains in the connectivity cloud, Konoike Group easily secures and administers an otherwise complex deployment.\n\n\"Cloudflare gives us consistent, unified email security while allowing us to decentralize our operational burden. It provides each subsidiary with its own administrative console to add or remove users, adjust permissions, and establish policies within our central email infrastructure,\" says Tomatsu. \"One advantage of using Cloudflare is that no matter what language a subsidiary uses — Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Tagalog, or any other — it detects and quarantines suspicious emails without fail. Around the world, Cloudflare analysis and aggregation functions reduce the time required to analyze trends, and visualize and neutralize threats.\"\n\n### __Partnering for success__\n\nDespite its misgivings about entering a new, untested partnership when it embarked Overseas Email Environment Integration Project, Cloudflare delivered beyond the company's expectations. \n\n\"Given the global stakes and the number of people our email integration affected, we had some concerns about onboarding a new solutions partner,\" says Sato. \"Cloudflare put an end to our fears by providing top-notch support from the day we began the project until everything was up and running smoothly.\"  \"We also contact the support desk when we have discussions about possible product malfunctions, and the customer success team is able to provide us with more in-depth answers in those discussions, which we feel leads to the expected results.\" says Tomatsu. \"We really value Cloudflare's Premium Success  instruction on product functionality, support for our functional improvement requests, and interest in our input on its product roadmaps.\"",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare protects and optimizes applications for iGaming brands on the SOFTSWISS platform",
						"longDescription": "## __SOFTSWISS secures and optimizes industry-leading iGaming platform with support from Cloudflare__\n\n[SOFTSWISS](https://www.softswiss.com/?utm_medium=cloudflare&utm_campaign=case-study) creates software for over 860 iGaming companies around the world. The company offers everything organizations need to launch an iGaming brand, including games, payments, licensing, player account management, engagement and retention tools, marketing and intelligence solutions, and more.\n\nAmong other achievements, SOFTSWISS was the first iGaming software company to support crypto gambling and gaming and has propelled many of their clients to win industry awards.\n\n### __Challenge: Defending against DDoS and malicious bots__\n\nThe gambling and iGaming industry is a frequent target of cyberattacks. Some of these attacks target the financial data and other personally identifiable information (PII) held by these platforms.\n\nHowever, DDoS attacks stand alone as the most significant threat to SOFTSWISS and its clients. For some time, SOFTSWISS' systems were targeted by multiple daily attacks designed to disrupt betting transactions. \n\nBefore switching to Cloudflare, SOFTSWISS managed their own DDoS protection. However, as the company and their customer base grew, the cost of maintaining these protections in-house became infeasible. They realized ensuring business continuity and application performance required a third-party solution.\n\n### __Managing the DDoS Threat__\n\nSOFTSWISS relies on Cloudflare to protect their infrastructure from a wide range of attacks. According to Sergey Kastukevich, SOFTSWISS' Deputy CTO, \"Cloudflare acts as the sole entry point to our network infrastructure. This protects us from a range of attacks, especially at the network and transport layers.\"\n\nRouting traffic through Cloudflare's global network dramatically reduces SOFTSWISS' exposure to DDoS attacks. In the past, they experienced multiple DDoS attacks per week; however, after deploying Cloudflare DDoS Protection, the attacks that actually reached SOFTSWISS' systems dropped to a few per month.\n\nThe combination of reduced attack volumes and the Cloudflare dashboard simplifies security efforts for SOFTSWISS. According to Kastukevich, \"Cloudflare's protection allows us to concentrate our security efforts on a few attack vectors, freeing up resources to improve our services for clients.\"\n\n### __Enhancing efficiency and application performance__\n\nSomething else that attracted SOFTSWISS to Cloudflare was the latter's SSL for SaaS offering, which simplifies certificate management for secure SSL connections. SOFTSWISS currently manages about 1,000 domains, including 300 custom hostnames. SSL for SaaS eliminates wasted time SOFTSWISS employees would otherwise have to spend configuring and managing domains.\n\nMany of SOFTSWISS' clients have graphics-heavy webpages, which can cause latency and generate significant load on the company's servers. To address these issues, SOFTSWISS also uses the Cloudflare global network to host static content. On average, about 200 terabytes of data per month is now served from cache — a 90% cache hit rate.\n\nSOFTSWISS also uses Cloudflare Argo Smart Routing to improve the performance of their clients' applications. With the Cloudflare global network, the company has seen a 10-20% performance improvement for traffic from their EU-based data center to remote regions such as Southeast Asia and South America.\n\n### __Adapting to evolving business needs__\n\nThe iGaming industry is evolving rapidly, putting pressure on SOFTSWISS to scale and deliver the solutions and capabilities that their clients need. According to Kastukevich, \"As the market changes, we need to rapidly change our roadmaps and products accordingly. The flexibility that Cloudflare provides us is extremely helpful since it enables us to adapt to and anticipate our clients' needs.\"\n\nHe also commented that his Cloudflare team's deep knowledge of the iGaming industry was essential for their success. He says, \"This competence in the gambling sector and great products saves us a lot of time, energy, and money. It's vital for our time-to-market and our clients' success.\"\n\n### __Finding the Right Fit__\n\nBeyond the technical capabilities, Kastukevich was also impressed by the customer service that he received as part of the Cloudflare experience. He commented, \"Something I noticed immediately was that I was interacting with real people, without a script. Cloudflare puts the client first, and you can feel it.\"\n\nBased on these conversations and recommendations, he's confident that SOFTSWISS has the solutions that they need to deliver a positive experience for their clients.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Hyperconnect provides secure, seamless live video streaming and real-time communications to millions worldwide using Cloudflare__\n\nSeoul-based Hyperconnect is a video streaming innovator. [Azar](https://hyperconnect.com/en/business#azar) — Hyperconnect's real-time video communication and multi-language social discovery platform with over 540 million downloads — enables communication across cultures by instantly translating its users' voice, video, and text communications. With an established membership primarily worldwide, Azar has already facilitated over 100 billion matches in 21 languages.  \n\nHyperconnect's real-time streaming and live video-sharing platform, [Hakuna Live](https://hyperconnect.com/en/business#hakuna), creates a more public and interactive experience. Popular in Korea and Japan, Hakuna Live provides over 23 million Hakuna users with broadcast capabilities that connect group chats of up to six hosts with unlimited audiences of public users.\n\nAcquired for $1.72 billion in 2021 by Match Group — home of online dating services like Match, Tinder, and Hinge — Hyperconnect and its portfolio of cutting-edge, real-time video, AI, and augmented reality avatar technologies are now being applied and showcased across Match Group's subsidiaries.\n\n### __Challenge: Accelerating international growth without compromising performance or user satisfaction__\n\nAs a provider of live streaming and video communications intent on expanding its international footprint, solid network performance is high on Hyperconnect's list of priorities. When the platform approached half a billion users, however, maintaining high-quality service became problematic. As the company's user base increased, each new bottleneck on the Internet further compromised the Hyperconnect user experience. \n\n\"Even a small amount of latency caused our users significant delays,\" explains Roa Park, engineer at Hyperconnect. \"Because those delays interrupted real-time communications, it was a major issue for us. It demanded immediate attention as global interest in our services increased.\" \n\nHyperconnect's security concerns also grew alongside its applications' global reach and popularity. As more people around the globe embraced the platform, Hyperconnect experienced a surge in unwanted online attention. This included DDoS attacks, as well as heightened exposure to zero-day exploits and other Internet-borne threats. \n\nFaced with Hyperconnect's rapid expansion, its existing network and hosting provider could not cope with either its international bandwidth requirements or security needs. \n\n### __Solution: Improving international customer engagement and reducing TTFB with the Cloudflare connectivity cloud__\n\nSeeking a way to improve the security and stability of its services, Hyperconnect switched to Cloudflare. To address its performance and latency issues on a global scale, Hyperconnect chose Cloudflare's connectivity cloud for application performance services. \n\nUsing the Cloudflare global network, Hyperconnect leveraged over 310 points of Cloudflare presence in 120 countries to make sure its content was always located as near to its users as possible — both in Asia and abroad. Cloudflare's network of globally distributed servers ensured that each video stream reached the end user with minimal latency or delay, even during peak use periods. Argo Smart Routing in the connectivity cloud minimized Internet slowdowns and latency between regions by detecting network issues in real time and always redirecting stream traffic along the most efficient path.   \n\nCloudflare performance services improved Hyperconnect's time to first byte (TTFB), allowing users to dive right into chat or begin streaming as soon as they connect. Faster TTFB also meant faster load times, reducing the likelihood of users abandoning Hyperconnect services due to slow performance. \n\n\"Since we started using Cloudflare, we've seen significant performance gains across the board, regardless of region,\" says Park. \"That keeps our users engaged and active online and improves conversion to our paid services.\"   \n\n![Hyperconnect social image](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4U0tKfw1Fh6S9sXVyzNfNq/9fbd663019aaf89442df80683715c6e8/hyperconnect_social_1.png)\n\nBy caching static and frequently requested content on its global network, Cloudflare also helped reduce bandwidth demands and round trips to Hyperconnect's origin servers. The reduced demand resulted in significant cuts to the company's operational costs. \n\nHyperconnect has saved even more by deploying the Cloudflare developer platform to remove processing loads from its own servers. It uses Workers to dynamically resize, optimize, and serve images and platform updates from the connectivity cloud.  \n\n### __Securing mobile applications against hostile traffic, and online threats with a single, straightforward solution__\n\nIn tandem with its adoption of Cloudflare's application performance services, the security team at Hyperconnect implemented Cloudflare's core [application security services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/). With Cloudflare in place to protect its domains, websites, and [APIs](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/api-security/), Hyperconnect mitigates the hostile traffic from DDoS attacks, and other Internet-related security threats. By reducing its attack surfaces and deflecting unwanted traffic with Cloudflare, the company achieved further bandwidth reductions and cost savings. \n\n\"Cloudflare solutions bolster our resilience against malicious threats and create a secure environment for our users,\" says Park. \"Cloudflare has proven invaluable in countering DDoS attacks and zero-day exploits, and the bandwidth we conserve plays a crucial role in the way we manage costs as we expand.\"  \n\nFor Hyperconnect, simplified maintenance and ease of use have been key benefits of the move to Cloudflare. With its straightforward, unified control interface, Cloudflare saves the company both time and effort when it comes to managing its performance and security systems across multiple territories.\n\n\"Other providers offered what appeared to be similar services, but they always came with a hidden cost — complexity,\" says Park. \"Cloudflare delivers as promised. That has allowed us to build excellent products without excessive additional effort.\"   \n\nFor a company that depends on providing reliable connectivity between geographical regions and fast, uninterrupted service to its expanding international user base, Cloudflare has proven to be the ideal partner. \n\n\"Maintaining excellence is central to ensuring positive outcomes and seamless growth for the business,\" says Park. \"Cloudflare helps us translate our technical advancements into business advantages.\"  \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Overcoming legacy challenges: Temple & Webster choose Cloudflare for a secure, performant, and compliant network transformation__\n[\nTemple & Webster](https://www.templeandwebster.com.au/) is Australia's largest online retailer in the furniture and homewares market with over 200,000 products on offer from more than 500 suppliers, including direct sourcing capabilities through a private label division. Founded in 2011, Temple & Webster has changed the way people shop for furniture and homewares. They believe everyone wants to live more beautifully, and their vision is to make the world more beautiful, one room at a time. \n\n### __Challenge: Finding a single vendor to update content delivery and application security, while providing secure Zero Trust employee access__\n\nAs an online retailer, [Temple & Webster](https://www.templeandwebster.com.au/) is always striving to improve their website to make a memorable first impression, build their brand and drive sales.\n\n\"We create beautiful solutions and depend on beautiful imagery and galleries to help our customers find their perfect product,\" says Mike Henriques, Chief Information Officer at Temple & Webster. \"To make that happen, we have a fairly large technology team to optimise the customer experience.\"\n\nAs part of Temple & Webster's ongoing website optimisation efforts, the company wanted to replace their legacy content delivery (CDN) provider, which staff found difficult to configure and lacking in critical security capabilities.\n\n\"Our first goal was front-end optimisation. We wanted a consistent toolset to accelerate HTML and image delivery, and improve our caching,\" says Henriques. \"On the security side, we wanted to improve our WAF and bot management. As the market leader, we were conscious of the potential for high volumes of unwanted traffic on the site, but we needed more clarity than we were getting from our existing solution.\"\n\nTemple & Webster also recognised the need to modernise security for their hybrid workforce. With hundreds of employees going into offices three days per week, the IT and security teams needed to ensure consistent, high-speed and reliable protections across remote and corporate settings. Moreover, embracing best practices like Zero Trust would enable Temple & Webster to get ahead of forthcoming cybersecurity guidance and regulations from the Australian government. \n\nFinally, Temple and Webster wanted to achieve the global standard for information security management best practices, [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) compliance. The company was looking for a centrally administered security and networking solution that would help simplify the certification process.\n\n\"With all the activity in the Australian cyber security space over the last 12 months, it was time to take a more mature, compliant approach to securing the business,\" says Henriques. \"The incumbent solution provided adequate functionality, but we knew it could not stand up over time. As our headcount and our applications grew, we needed to take better control.\"\n\n![TPW Social Image](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7KIjoAobUIRxJEWE5T8Vmd/260bc331a4c77201634fd08bc50f9eec/TPW_Social_2.jpeg)\n\n### __Solution: Out with the old — optimising performance, stopping bots, and maximising resources__\n\nTo optimise performance and [security](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) for their websites and web applications, Temple & Webster replaced their legacy vendor with Cloudflare's [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/) and [WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/). From the start, Cloudflare's ease of use impressed the technology team.\n\n\"Cloudflare is very intuitive — the learning curve is negligible compared to other vendor's solutions,\" says Henriques. \n\nCloudflare improved the Temple & Webster website's performance and equipped their developers with valuable insights for further optimisation. \n\n\"Cloudflare is multiple times better than our previous CDN — load times for our static assets have gone from 50-80ms to 20-50ms,\" says Henriques. \"With Cloudflare giving us more visibility than we have ever had into optimising JavaScript, load and execution times, and application response times, we can tweak and reduce the time it takes to deliver content to the customer.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare WAF and Bot Management, Temple & Webster have also seen functional and performance improvements in website security. The SecOps teams now have far more detailed information and visibility about unwanted web activity and an automated system in place to manage defences. The result is an improved online security posture.\n\n\"From the Cloudflare dashboard, it didn't take much effort to find the right balance to defend the site against unwanted traffic while optimising the experience for our customers and valid bots,\" says Henriques. \"It is a big step up from where we were.\"\n\n### __In with the new — streamlining employee access and accelerating compliance certification with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nAfter onboarding Cloudflare to protect their public-facing websites and applications, Temple & Webster saw the potential to consolidate security for their hybrid workforce on the same platform.\n\n\"We quickly discovered that Cloudflare is more of an ecosystem than a specific product set,\" says Henriques. \"The more we learn about Cloudflare capabilities, the more new use cases we plan to tackle on our roadmap.\"\n\nTemple & Webster were interested in adopting identity-based Zero Trust policies for application access and started a proof of concept with a subset of users – specifically remote employees spread across Australia, their Philippines staff, and third-party technology partners. The successful proof of concept gave Temple & Webster confidence to roll out Zero Trust access for their entire workforce. The Cloudflare platform's rapid [implementation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/how-to-implement-zero-trust/) and ease of use were the deciding factors.\n\n\"We enabled Zero Trust access to our administrative and staging environments within hours,\" says Henriques. \"From a security and performance perspective, we eliminated the risks and overheads that came with our VPN solution. That put Temple & Webster on a path to replace all our legacy access models with Cloudflare Zero Trust.\"\n\nSwitching to Cloudflare and deprecating legacy CDN, WAF, and VPN services has saved Temple & Webster significant time and resources.\n\n\"Cloudflare reduced the time our Operations and SecOps teams spent maintaining and optimising legacy software by up to  50%,\" says Henriques. \"Cloudflare self-manages. It doesn't need constant observation. I used to spend several hours each week discussing employee access and security configurations, now I spend that time on more strategic work.\"\n\nTemple & Webster find the Cloudflare platform easy to use, allowing the company to delegate ongoing administration to more junior team members. This frees up senior SecOps and Operations staff to focus on strategic priorities like strengthening regulatory compliance. \n\nCloudflare Zero Trust has had ISO/IEC 27001 certification since 2019 and the platform's robust security and data protection controls are essential to Temple & Webster's compliance strategy. \n\n\"We are on the path to compliance and, because Cloudflare Zero Trust has been so easy to implement and administer, we will achieve certification much earlier than we expected,\" says Henriques. \"Because of Cloudflare, we've shifted our thinking about network design. We're looking at unifying access management across all of our systems and applications and moving away from VPNs and entangled network rules.\"\n\nGoing forward, Temple & Webster will continue to modernise security for their hybrid workforce. The company has plans to collaborate closely with Cloudflare experts to strengthen security for their employees and customers alike.\n\n\"Cloudflare builds great products,\" says Henriques \"But, it is the support, collaboration, and deep understanding from Cloudflare's people that make things happen in hours or days rather than months.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Jin Air blocks malicious bot traffic, accelerates performance, and improves online sales revenue with the Cloudflare connectivity cloud__\n\nFounded in 2008, Jin Air is one of South Korea's largest low-cost passenger airlines. It moves around 6 million passengers annually and offers its customers the greatest selection of domestic destinations of any Korean carrier. With four Boeing 777s in its fleet, Jin Air is also the only Korean low-cost carrier with widebody aircraft on its international routes.\n\nIn addition to its extensive domestic services, Jin Air's 26-aircraft fleet serves an expanding list of international destinations. These include China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam.   \n\n### __Challenge: Stopping bot attacks, SQL injection attempts, and fake bookings__\n\nAs air travel to and from Korea returned to pre-pandemic levels, Jin Air saw a strong uptick in demand for its domestic and international flights and services. With the welcome increase in sales and traffic to its websites, the company, however, also experienced a rise in unwanted online attention.\n\n\"We faced an increasing series of attacks — external bots and various other cyber threats were on the rise,\" explains Mr Park, Manager of Jin Air's Strategic Digital Transformation Group. \"Alongside DDoS attacks, SQL injection incidents, and excessive access attempts, we also experienced third-party web scraping agents impersonating Google bots and a spike in fake bookings.\"\n\nThe SQL injection and automated credential stuffing attempts attacks posed a potential threat to the airline's data centers and sensitive passenger information. Likewise, the fake bookings created by automated inventory-hoarding bots blocked genuine customers from reserving flights online. In addition to the disruptions to their website and customer services, the costly bandwidth consumed by the malicious traffic increased the airline's operating expenses and negatively affected its bottom line. \n\nFaced with increasingly sophisticated attacks, Jin Air's online security partner at the time, an internationally recognized early entrant into the cyber security and content delivery space, failed to address the problems, despite the high cost of its pay-per-use services.\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare Application Services to secure and enhance the Jin Air customer experience__  \n\nIn search of a cost-effective solution that delivers on its promises, Jin Air turned to Cloudflare. Working with Cloudflare and [Megazone Cloud Corporation](https://www.megazone.com/) — Cloudflare's 2022 Services Partner of the Year and [2022 Korean Most Valuable Player award winner](https://blog.cloudflare.com/partner-award-winners-2022/) — Jin Air began a proof of concept (POC) to evaluate Cloudflare services against those of their incumbent vendor. \n\nThroughout the POC and implementation, Megazone provided a local, Korean-language liaison between the airline and the Cloudflare team. The Korean systems integrator offered technical consulting, implementation services, and fast, accurate on-site technical support. This ensured the smooth migration of the airline's custom security settings to the new Cloudflare solution. \n\nCompleting the POC, Cloudflare and the Korean systems integrator began implementing Cloudflare Application services, installing the Cloudflare WAF, Bot Management, DDoS Protection, and Rate Limiting to secure Jin Air's web domains. With Cloudflare's core [security services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) protecting all of its online applications, Jin Air saw an immediate reduction in malicious traffic.    \n\n\"Using Cloudflare, we mitigated our external web threats overnight,\" says Park. \"We eliminated 99.96% of our problem bot traffic and secured our site against fake bookings.\"\n\nAs a result of its success using Cloudflare to block malicious bots from accessing its web properties, Jin Air also cut its bandwidth consumption a reduction that translates directly into operational savings for the airline. A combination of moving away from its previous vendor's pay-per-use pricing structure and the efficiency gained from Cloudflare's automated managed WAF rulesets instead of time-consuming manual WAF updates contribute further to the airline's savings.  \n\n\"Overall, Cloudflare reduced our traffic consumption by 51% with managed rules for WAF, DDoS mitigation, and dynamic bot challenges,\" says Park. \"Cloudflare's automatic updates, managed rulesets, and dynamic challenges secure us against zero-day exploits and other new threats in seconds rather than the minutes it took our previous vendor.\"     \n\n### __Cloudflare application performance services in the connectivity cloud accelerate the international customer experience__  \n\nWith its websites, applications, and services secure, Jin Air began a campaign to enhance its online customer experience. The airline expanded its collaboration with Cloudflare and Megazone to include Cloudflare application performance services — the Cloudflare CDN, Tunnel, and Smart Routing. The goal was to support further development of its Japanese, Chinese, Southeast Asian, and Oceanian customer bases.\n\nLeveraging Cloudflare's global points of presence — more than 310 cities in over 120 countries including mainland China — Jin Air optimized the performance and speed of its web properties. It reduced latency and shortened processing times for searches and ticket purchases. \n\nCaching content in the connectivity cloud, Jin Air also optimized its ability to update its international web services. Cloudflare pushed the airline's global cache purge times and distribution of new cache rules to below five seconds — it took the previous vendor 10 minutes. A similar reduction in real-time event confirmations — from 10 minutes to under 30 seconds — ensures the airline's worldwide customers securely receive up-to-the-minute information about seat availability, special offers, and time-sensitive promotions. \n\n\"The connectivity cloud has improved our connection speeds, especially to China, Japan, and the US — which are important growth markets,\" says Park. Our Cloudflare-enhanced web performance and accessibility in those countries helps increase our international ticket sales.\"\n\nBased on its experience working with Cloudflare and Megazone to secure its web applications and accelerate ticket purchases for its customers abroad, Jin Air has plans to extend the partnership. The airline is currently exploring additional services in Cloudflare's connectivity cloud, specifically the[ Cloudflare Zero Trust services](https://www.cloudflare.com/enterprise/) that could dynamically connect its international workforces to company resources using identity-based security controls.

						"longDescription": "## __SYBO's Subway Surfers reaches a global audience with help from Cloudflare R2 and Argo Smart Routing__\n\nSYBO is a Copenhagen-based gaming company that has developed several hit games over the past 11 years. Best known for the hit mobile game Subway Surfers, an endless runner game beloved by players around the world. Within a week of its release in 2012, Subway Surfers was the most downloaded game in 20 countries, a number that quickly increased to 50. In 2023, the game achieved over 4 billion total downloads and over 150 million monthly active users.\n\n### __Challenge:__ \n\nSYBO's games are played around the world, however before using Cloudflare, adoption and reach were constrained by its infrastructure. Originally, the company selected cloud regions based on its location in Copenhagen, Denmark. However, as its user base expanded, some players had difficulty connecting from their mobile ISP to the corporate servers. SYBO needed network infrastructure capable of connecting mobile ISPs' networks around the world to the company's cloud services while minimizing network latency and mobile disconnects.\n\n### __Argo Smart Routing provides affordable global reach__\n\nAs a mobile game company, SYBO works with a patchwork of mobile ISPs located all around the world. While games can be played offline, certain key features, such as leaderboards and advertising, require an active internet connection.\n\nCloudflare Argo Smart Routing eliminates the challenges of routing traffic between a global user base and SYBO's servers. According to Mathew Duggan, Principal Security Engineer at SYBO, \"For many ISPs in India, users experience an 80% improvement in performance by routing over Cloudflare rather than a direct connection over the public Internet. This is a big market for us, so these performance improvements are critical.\"\n\n### __R2 and global caching enable creative freedom and experimentation__\n\nCloudflare's caching is critical to SYBO's ability to serve users worldwide – approximately 50% of its traffic hits the cache. Duggan says, \"With Cloudflare R2 and caching, we can now serve up to a petabyte of traffic and save around $60,000 each month. Cloudflare substantially expands our ability to experiment and enter new markets.\"\n\nSYBO has also adopted R2 to support creative assets for in-game campaigns. In the past, the company's designers would develop a range of creative assets — only for bandwidth and cost constraints to force the company to use smaller, lower-resolution versions instead.\n\nBy hosting these assets on R2, SYBO is now able to provide its designers with much more creative freedom to maintain the game's top-tier quality. According to Duggan, \"R2 has allowed us to not only build the creative campaigns that we want, but also serve them to users. With Cloudflare, we don't need to worry about compromising image resolution or breaking the bank.\"\n\nR2 has also enabled SYBO to perform experiments, including region-specific campaigns. In the past, this would have required complex reconfiguration of the company's load balancer. With Cloudflare, configuring routing for an experimental campaign is easy, and caching limits the price tag of even a failed experiment.\n\n### __Blocking near-constant DDoS attacks and malicious bot requests__\n\nIn addition to supporting a global user base, security is also of paramount importance to SYBO. Like many gaming companies, it suffers frequent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The company is also bombarded with traffic from automated bots, including from unauthorized versions of the company's games.\n\nDuggan says, DDOS attacks happen regularly, but we can count on Cloudflare as the first to notify us.\" In his experience, Cloudflare has mitigated every DDoS attack, eliminating the potential impacts of such attacks for legitimate users.\n\nThe company also receives large volumes of automated bot traffic. Cracked versions of the company's games are recompiled with new advertising or in-app purchases. On an average day, Cloudflare blocks about 10 million requests from these unauthorized games, and other malicious bot traffic.\n\n### __Unlocking new opportunities with connectivity cloud__\n\nCloudflare's connectivity cloud provides a range of flexible, integrated services that an organization can quickly roll out, customize, and scale. SYBO has taken advantage of this fact to expand and further optimize its gameplay experiences. According to Duggan, \"Cloudflare's connectivity cloud helped us to evolve our business. Switching to Argo Smart Routing saved resources that allowed us to move to R2 and explore new opportunities.\" SYBO is excited to see how other Cloudflare solutions, such as Waiting Room, could enable the company to host events or campaigns that would have previously been impossible.",

The platform also licenses bestselling contemporary literature to enhance its collection, make popular content available to its readers, and attract new users to the platform. \n\n### __Challenge: Protecting authentic content in a threat-laden environment__\n\nFor the Nasadiya Technologies engineering team, safeguarding the Pratilipi platform presented a series of unique challenges. As India's largest digital storytelling platform and the country's foremost publisher of user-generated content, the team's focus was safeguarding Pratilipi's creators, their contributions, and their readers. \n\n\"Building and maintaining trust with our creators is central to Pratilipi's ongoing success,\" explains Gauri Kanekar, Nasadiya Technologies' Vice President of Engineering. \"That means focusing our efforts on securing the platform against activities that threaten the authenticity and originality of our platform and content.\"  \n\nBecause Pratilipi operates in a country where mobile phone traffic exceeds desktop Internet usage by nearly 300 percent, the platform's business model focuses on in-app advertisements and multi-tier subscriptions to generate revenue and compensate contributors based on the views their stories attract. As the platform scaled, however, the Nasadiya team encountered malicious bot attacks that compromised the platform's performance, skewed usage data, and threatened secure payment systems.             \n\n\"As we grew, we faced a massive influx of unwanted traffic that overwhelmed Pratilipi's legitimate visitors, affected our customers, and impeded our growth,\" says Kanekar. \"Unfortunately, our previous CDN provider could not resolve the problems. We needed to find a comprehensive solution that could tackle our issues, help us retain user confidence, and ensure a safe online environment for everyone.\"\n\n### __Solution: Maximum value with minimum effort — securing original content and streamlining mobile app development with Cloudflare__\n\nIn its quest for a highly secure solution that aligned with its development and business goals, Nasadiya Technologies turned to Cloudflare to enhance and protect Pratilipi as the platform scaled.\n\n\"Operating as a smaller team, we needed a security partner that could free us up to concentrate on our development roadmap and business expansion,\" says Kanekar. \"Cloudflare gives us precisely that. It supplies the tools we need to ensure the safety and reliability of our online services while allowing us to stay focused on long-term business objectives. \n\nUsing Cloudflare Application Security Services, specifically the Cloudflare Firewall (WAF), Rate Limiting, Bot Management, and DDoS Protection, Nasadiya Technologies mitigated the three most significant threats to its operations — DDoS attacks, malicious bots, and plagiarism.    \n\n\"Out of the box, in its default configuration, Cloudflare takes care of 95% of our issues with untrusted bots,\" he says. \"The rest we can address by creating new firewall rules and implementing small customizations to meet specific needs.\"\n\nCloudflare Bot Management secures the platform using machine learning, behavioral analysis, and threat fingerprinting to detect and neutralize malicious traffic on the Cloudflare global network. It stops threats before they endanger the integrity of Pratilipi content or payment gateways. The Cloudflare WAF, Rate Limiting and DDoS Management provide additional layers of protection to prevent service disruptions that could negatively affect the user experience.\n\n\"Cloudflare provides us maximum value with minimum effort. Implementing the solution was effortless,\" says Kanekar. \"Clear and comprehensive documentation made it easy to understand and use the system effectively, and the Cloudflare team worked with us to identify gaps in our setup and implement the solution correctly.\"\n\n### __Improved performance at home and abroad with the Cloudflare connectivity cloud__\n\nTogether with Cloudflare Application Services, the Cloudflare Global Content Delivery Network (CDN), and Argo Smart Routing form the backbone of Nasadiya Technologies' Cloudflare connectivity cloud. Leveraging the 15 Indian data centers and 310 points of presence Cloudflare maintains around the globe to cache Pratilipi content close to its users, Nasadiya Technologies ensures that the platform's readers and contributors always enjoy a highly performant experience. \n\n\"All of our feedback has been positive, both in India and internationally,\" says Kanekar. \"By substantially improving the delivery speed of our text, image, and audio assets, Cloudflare has allowed us to ensure our global users enjoy a frictionless reading experience as we expand our products into international markets.\"  \n\nIn concrete terms, Kanekar estimates Cloudflare has reduced Pratilipi's bandwidth consumption by over 50%. In some instances, the connectivity cloud increases the Pratilipi platform's efficiency and improves resource utilization by as much as 90%. \n\nUsing Argo Smart Routing, the platform also enjoys significant performance and reliability gains by circumventing Internet traffic jams and bottlenecks. For Nasadiya Technologies, this translates into maximum uptime and the fastest possible connection for all Pratilipi users, whether they are in remote communities or India's most populous urban centers. \n\n### __Cloudflare Workers and developer platform secure and streamline mobile app development and deployment__\n\nBecause mobile devices rather than traditional desktop systems dominate the Indian telecommunications ecosystem, Pratilipi is primarily a mobile platform. In this mobile-first environment, Workers, and the Cloudflare developer platform enable the Nasadiya Technologies team to safely and efficiently develop, deploy, maintain, and scale their iOS and Android applications on the Cloudflare Global Network. \n\n\"Cloudflare Workers has been critical to our mobile application development, simplifying our processes and allowing our team members to work independently without issues,\" says Kanekar. \"Interacting with our APIs, Workers lets us create custom actions to secure and modify our headers, and perform optimizations that enhance performance and the user journey.\"  \n\nBased on its successes using the developer platform, Nasadiya Technologies is exploring Cloudflare Workers to extend the company's connectivity cloud to include disaster recovery measures and ensure business continuity in the face of unforeseen disruptions. \n\nThe engineering team is also planning to implement the Cloudflare Content Malware Scanning features to add another layer of security to the platform.  \n\n\"It aligns perfectly with our use cases,\" says Kanekar.\" We will be adding Content Malware Scanning  to our connectivity cloud in the near future.\"               \n\nWorking together, the Nasadiya Technologies engineers have formed a close relationship with their Cloudflare account team. According to Kanekar, Cloudflare has always been a trusted advisor to offer whatever assistance the company requires. \n\n\"Cloudflare is remarkably supportive, and we share a similar mindset — as a partner, they consider our success their own,\" says Kanekar. \"With a single connectivity cloud platform, Cloudflare simplifies security and performance management, providing emerging startups with the time and peace of mind to concentrate on business growth.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Securing a growing hybrid workforce__\n\nSince our founding in 2010, Cloudflare has prioritized using our own services to solve our internal IT and security challenges. This approach helps us test and improve capabilities before shipping them to customers and has been foundational in how Cloudflare has secured our own workforce.\n\nAs Cloudflare's attack surfaces grow with the addition of more employees, customers, and technology, we have an obligation to further strengthen our security posture and equip our IT and security teams with strong visibility and control. In response, we've built and adopted services from [Cloudflare One](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/), our [SASE](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/) and [SSE](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/security-service-edge-sse/) platform, to secure access to applications, [defend against cyber threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/), and protect sensitive data.\n\nCloudflare spans more than 3,500 people in dozens of offices and remote locations. This case study explores how Cloudflare uses our own Cloudflare One services to keep users safe and productive across the organization.\n\n\"Securing Cloudflare with our own services is the most effective way not only to protect our business, but also to innovate for our customers,\" says Grant Bourzikas, Chief Security Officer. \"Our commitment to protecting Cloudflare with Cloudflare helps our security team and services stay ahead of the curve as our organization continues to grow in ambition and complexity.\"\n\n### __Securing access to applications__\n\nCloudflare follows [Zero Trust best practices](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/) to secure access to all self-hosted applications for all users, whether remote or in-office. Specifically, we use our own [Zero Trust Network Access ](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/)(ZTNA) service (Cloudflare Access) to verify identity, enforce [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/) with hardware keys, and evaluate device posture for every request. This posture evolved over several years and has enabled Cloudflare to better protect our growing workforce more effectively and advise customers based on our own experiences.\n\n### *Our ZTNA origin story: Replacing our VPN*\n\nCloudflare's interest in Zero Trust began with a practical problem that our engineers solved for themselves: streamlining access to developer environments without the hassle of a Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n\nIn 2015, on the rare occasions when employees worked remotely, they were forced to backhaul traffic through an [on-prem VPN appliance](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-vpn/) to reach internally-hosted applications. The VPN's latency and unresponsiveness particularly frustrated on-call engineers, who had to log in at odd hours to triage time-sensitive problems. \n\nTo solve their own pain point, our engineers built [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/access/), which started as a reverse proxy service that routed access requests through the closest Cloudflare data center, instead of backhauling through VPN hardware. For each request, Access verified users based on our [identity provider](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-an-identity-provider/) in a browser window, freeing them from the inconvenience and risks of remembering VPN client login credentials. \n\nThe smooth authentication experience drove organic adoption of Access for more apps and further reduced reliance on the VPN. Engineers started by protecting Grafana with this new authentication workflow, followed by web apps like our Atlassian suite and eventually even non-HTTP resources. \n\nThe sudden transition to remote work during the pandemic only accelerated this migration of apps behind Access. By summer 2020, Cloudflare's IT teams had achieved an ~80% reduction in the time spent servicing VPN-related tickets and a ~70% reduction in ticket volume compared to the prior year, resulting in time savings estimated at $100K annually.\n\nIn early 2021, Cloudflare's security team mandated that all internally-hosted applications move behind Access, helping us reduce our attack surface with least privilege, default-deny and identity-based controls. Later that year, Cloudflare had deprecated its VPN entirely, and we have translated our experiences into [prescriptive guidance for other organizations](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-augment-or-replace-your-vpn/).\n\nOnboarding and offboarding employees has also gotten simpler. New employees no longer have to learn to set up a VPN, saving upwards of 300 hours annually for the hundreds of new hires in 2020. Instead, configuring application access is now largely automated via Cloudflare's integration with the infrastructure-as-code tool [Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/). \n\n \"By replacing our VPN and adopting Zero Trust internally, our colleagues now have a faster, safer, and simpler way to connect to apps and stay productive, says Derek Pitts, Director of Security.  \"With our ZTNA service, Cloudflare does not have to make any trade-offs between improving security and creating an amazing user experience.\"\n\n### *Hard key MFA and thwarting a targeted phishing attack*\n\nSince rolling out ZTNA internally, Cloudflare has embraced MFA. The journey began by allowing MFA with soft keys like Time-Based One-Time passwords (TOTPs) delivered over text, email, and apps. Starting in 2018, Cloudflare's security team began distributing hard keys and allowing them as an optional form of authentication across specific applications. \n\nThe [biggest change in this MFA approach](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust/) began in February 2021, when [social engineering attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/social-engineering-attack/) against employees – including calls impersonating Cloudflare IT – became more frequent. In response, Cloudflare began requiring [FIDO2-compliant](https://www.yubico.com/resources/glossary/fido-2/) hard keys authentication for all apps and users – a more phishing-resistant approach. Whether on corporate laptops or personal mobile devices, all employees must now tap their [FIPS-validated](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/fips_validated_cryptography#:~:text=Definitions%3A,%2D3%20(as%20amended).) security key from YubiKey to reach an application, and all other forms of MFA have been disabled. This method also takes advantage of stronger cryptography via the [WebAuthn](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-now-supports-security-keys-with-web-authentication-webauthn/) standard protocol.\n\nThis hard key approach was put to the test in August 2022, when Cloudflare thwarted a [targeted phishing attack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/) that successfully breached other large enterprises. Seventy-six Cloudflare employees received legitimate-looking texts which led to a fake Okta login page. The threat actors entered any harvested credentials into the identity provider's actual login site in real-time to prompt a TOTP code back to the user. For organizations that relied on TOTP codes, once an employee entered that TOTP into the fake login page, the threat actors would initiate a phishing payload to control the employee's machine remotely. \n\nEven though a few Cloudflare employees entered their credentials, Cloudflare's approach prevented the attackers from taking over any machines. After identifying the attack, Cloudflare took several further steps to neutralize risk:\n- Blocked the phishing domain with our own [secure web gateway](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/) (SWG)\n- Isolated access to all newly registered domains with our [remote browser isolation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-browser-isolation/) (RBI) service\n- Collaborated with industry partners to shut down the attacker's infrastructure\n- Killed active sessions via ZTNA and reset compromised credentials\n- Scanned for identities and devices with unverified two factor authentication per our activity logs\n- Blocked IPs used by threat actor from accessing any Cloudflare service\n\nAltogether, Cloudflare's multiple layers of security – with strong MFA as the first line of defense – thwarted this sophisticated attack. \n\n*__To learn more about this chapter in the story, read our [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/) and [solution brief](http://cfl.re/targeted-SMS-phishing-attack-case-study) on the incident.__*\n\n### *Extending device posture checks*\n\nCloudflare has a strong focus on extending device posture checks across users and apps, using context from both first- and third-party software.\n\nToday, Cloudflare's [device client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/) forward proxies traffic via encrypted outbound connections and is rolled out [via our mobile device manager](https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/mdm/) to all corporate-issued laptops. Employees can also use personal mobile devices that meet certain security criteria, including enrolling in our endpoint management. The device client is now required to access some critical internal resources for corporate laptops and will soon be required for access from personal mobile devices. \n\nCloudflare also runs Crowdstrike's Falcon software for endpoint protection across all corporate devices and builds conditional access policies that incorporate Crowdstrike telemetry. Specifically, access is only granted to resources if Crowdstrike's Zero Trust Assessment (ZTA) score – a number that represents the real-time health of a device – is above a minimum threshold. This ZTNA integration is just one of several facets of [ongoing collaboration ](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-crowdstrike-partnership/)between Cloudflare and Crowdstrike. \n\nAltogether, Cloudflare's security has gained detailed logging across every access request to every resource (even [SSH command logging](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ssh-command-logging/)). This widespread visibility across identities and devices helps us investigate incidents with greater agility.\n\n### __Defending against cyber threats__\nWe also deploy Cloudflare One services internally to defend against cyber threats. Examples include using our SWG and RBI to secure Internet browsing and using our [email security service](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/email-security-services/) to protect inboxes from phishing attacks.\n\n\"Cloudflare One's services protect us throughout the entire attack lifecycle by reducing our attack surface, mitigating Internet-based threats, restricting lateral movement, and preventing data or financial theft,\" says Bourzikas. \"Layering our web and email security over the past few years has helped us achieve consistent protections and visibility across our growing hybrid workforce.\"\n\n### *Protecting Internet browsing for remote users and offices*\n\nCloudflare began using our own SWG (also known as Gateway) when faced with a similar challenge as our customers: securing a workforce from a rise in online threats after shifting to remote work during the pandemic. \n\nOur first priority was rolling out DNS filtering to block users from reaching harmful or unwanted Internet domains based on security and content categories, which was achieved in the following phases within a year of the shift to remote work:\n- __DNS Filtering for all office locations.__ Setup took just a few days and only required pointing DNS traffic from office routers to our network. This location-based filtering protected the handful of users who still performed business-critical functions on-site, helped our administrators fine tune policy configurations, and are still in place today. \n- __Deploying Cloudflare's device client.__ Forward proxying traffic via the device client provides the foundation for user- and device-specific security controls and visibility, including encrypting every outbound connection to the Internet.\n- __DNS filtering for all remote users.__ By early 2021, Cloudflare had set up consistent DNS filtering policies and Internet experiences across remote and office users.\n\nAs Cloudflare has settled into more routine hybrid work, our security teams have benefited from additional controls and visibility for forward-proxied Internet traffic, including:\n\n- __Granular HTTP controls__- Our security teams [inspect HTTPS traffic](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-https-inspection/) to block access to specific websites identified as malicious by our security team, conduct [antivirus scanning](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/antivirus-scanning/), and apply identity-aware browsing policies.\n- __Selectively isolating Internet browsing__- In isolated browsing sessions, all web code is run on Cloudflare's network far from local devices, insulating users from any untrusted and malicious content. Today, social media, news outlets, personal email, and other potentially risky Internet categories are isolated. Newly seen domains, for example, fall into that last category, and Cloudflare excels in identifying them given the high volume of DNS queries we resolve (2B+ queries per day, on average).\n- __Geography-based logging__- Seeing where outbound requests originate helps our security teams understand the geographic distribution of our workforce, including our presence in high-risk areas.\n\n\"Today, Cloudflare has user- and device-specific visibility across all our employees, which helps us evaluate our risk more comprehensively,\" says Derek Pitts, Director of Security. \"As our risk profile evolves, our security teams calibrate our Internet browsing controls to ensure that threats are mitigated with minimal impact on user productivity.\"\n\n*__To learn more about this chapter in the story, read our [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-security-does-zero-trust/).__*\n\n### *Protecting inboxes with cloud email security*\n\nIn early 2020, Cloudflare experienced a surge in phishing attempts. Our email provider (Google Workspace) was strong in spam filtering for its native web application, but struggled with advanced threats, such as [business email compromise](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) (BEC). and other methods of accessing email like an iOS mobile app. Plus, as phishing volume increased, our IT teams spent too much time on manual investigations – roughly 15 to 30 minutes for simple attacks, and even longer for more sophisticated ones.\n\nTo address this issue, Cloudflare implemented cloud email security – at that time a third-party vendor – alongside Google Workspace. Within 30 days, we blocked 90,000 total attacks, leading to a significant and prolonged drop in phishing emails. Plus, the low false positive rate reduced the time spent on investigations, and security teams benefited from a wider array of insights, including the most-targeted employees.\n\n\"In fact, the technology was so effective at launch, that our CEO reached out to our Chief Security Officer to inquire if our email security was broken,\" [wrote](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-are-acquiring-area-1/) John Graham-Cumming, Cloudflare's Chief Technology Officer, \"Our CEO hadn't seen any phishing attempts reported by our employees for many weeks, a rare occurrence. It turns out our employees weren't reporting any phishing attempts, because the technology was catching all phishing attempts before they reached our employee's inboxes.\"\n\nIn light of this positive experience, [Cloudflare acquired Area 1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-are-acquiring-area-1/) in early 2022 and integrated it with Cloudflare One, enabling our customers and ourselves to take a more proactive security posture across multiple channels. \n\nFor example, [email link isolation](https://blog.cloudflare.com/safe-email-links/) uses RBI and email security functionality to open potentially suspicious links in an isolated browser. This neutralizes malicious code, and prevents users from taking risky actions on the webpage via tactics like restricting keyboard inputs and copy-paste. Among other applications, Cloudflare uses this functionality to stymie deferred phishing attacks that evade typical detections, helping keep our security teams safe while investigating phishing incidents.\n\n\"Cloudflare's email security catches phishing attempts before they reach our employees' inboxes,\" says Derek Pitts, Director of Security. \"Email continues to be one of the most popular attack vectors, and it gives me peace of mind knowing our service is so effective and straightforward for our staff to manage.\"\n\n### __Protecting sensitive data__\n\nLimiting who can access what apps with Zero Trust policies and defending against phishing and ransomware threats helps Cloudflare prevent data exfiltration. We are further mitigating the risks of data leaks with services like our [cloud access security broker](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-casb/?cf_target_id=62BEC593CF1D122C32D4721FB8958B1C) (CASB) and [data loss prevention](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dlp/?cf_target_id=5986994BF23D5FCE37D11A1A3F080015) (DLP) to detect sensitive data. \n\n- __Managing data exposure risks in SaaS apps__. This includes scanning our SaaS suites via API (like Google Workspace, GitHub, and Salesforce) for sensitive data and misconfigurations that risk leaks, and then acting on prescriptive guidance to remediate via SWG policies\n- __Detecting and controlling movement of sensitive data__. This includes proprietary and regulated classes of data like credentials and secrets, financials, and health information.\n\n*__To learn more about Cloudflare One's approach to data protection, read our [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-data-protection-announcement/).__*\n\n### __Our security-first culture__\n\nThe security services referenced earlier are only as valuable as the people and processes involved in implementing them. In particular, the milestones we've reached so far are a credit to our organization's overall security-first culture, which is rooted in the principle that \"security is part of everyone's job.\" \n\nFor example, Cloudflare operates its own internal 24x7 Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and encourages all employees to report suspicious activity early and often. This transparent \"see something, say something approach\" creates a first line of defense and a positive feedback loop: these reports from the front lines improve our approach. Leadership accepts and expects that more than 90% of employee reports to SIRT will turn out to be benign, because when real cyber attacks occur – as with the 2022 targeted phishing incident – timely alerts are critical. Moreover, this \"blame-free\" proactive approach applies to bug reporting for the internal deployment of our own services, helping make them stronger in the process.\n\n\"Cloudflare's security-first culture makes my job easier,\" says Bourzikas. \"Our employees are invested in making sure they have the highest quality security experiences, which in turn helps our teams build better services for our customers. This commitment is critical as we continue to extend capabilities and services with our Cloudflare One platform.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __EQT reduces administrative complexity, boosts security, and streamlines development productivity with Cloudflare's connectivity cloud__\n\nFounded in 1994, and publicly listed since 2019, [EQT](https://eqtgroup.com/) is a global investment company headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. With over €100 billion in assets under management, EQT's business lines cover private equity, venture capital, infrastructure, real estate, and other sectors.  \n\nEQT's investment strategy combines sector-specific expertise (e.g. healthcare, technology, services) with thematic focuses on macro challenges, which today include climate and nature, health and wellbeing, inclusion and equality, and urbanization. Over the past five years, [EQT has continued its strong historic performance — its portfolio companies grew revenue by 17%, EBITDA by 18%, and employee count by 7% on average annually](https://eqtgroup.com/about/business-model/). In particular, its private equity business is one of the largest in the world, ranking third in Private Equity International's PEI 300 in 2023 based on capital raised over the past five years.\n\nIn 2022, EQT grew its Asian presence by acquiring Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA).  As a result of the expansion, EQT now operates in countries representing [80% of the global GDP](https://eqtgroup.com/news/2022/eqt-combines-with-bpea-to-capture-growth-opportunities-in-asia/) across Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific.\n\n### __Challenge: Securing growth — A rapidly expanding global footprint__ \n\nIn addition to expanding its global and regional presence, over the past few years, EQT completed a major cloud migration and rapidly scaled its workforce. The combined changes and growth raised the stakes for its central IT and security team, which is responsible for both protecting its employees and investors and supporting security for its portfolio companies.\n\nTo prepare for its expansion, in 2017, EQT began migrating all of its on-prem infrastructure and applications to a 100% multi-cloud architecture. To aid in scaling its [broader digital transformation goals](https://eqtgroup.com/digitalization/), EQT began to explore cloud-based security vendors. \n\nMore recently, with the 2022 BPEA EQT merger, the company's global headcount jumped from roughly 800 employees to more than 1800. In response, EQT has focused on scaling protections for EQT workers and strengthening cybersecurity across its new portfolio companies. EQT also continues to grow as a public company, increasing investor attention and regulatory scrutiny. \n\n\"The cloud migration and global expansion compelled us to reimagine our technology stack and strengthen our security posture,\" says João Pedro Gonçalves, EQT's Global Chief Information Security Officer.  \"We wanted to bring on a cloud-native security like Cloudflare that could support us on a global scale into the future.\"\n\n### __Protecting public resources and streamlining configuration__   \n\nEQT's first challenge is a common starting point for Cloudflare customers: protecting its public websites with a [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/). Gonçalves was aware of Cloudflare's strong reputation in this area and, in fact, had direct positive experiences setting up Cloudflare in prior companies and for his personal use. \n\n\"Cloudflare was the first solution we turned to. We set it up, and it worked wonderfully,\" he says. \"As engineers, we like the fact that we could just sign up and start using and testing the service without the weeks of negotiation we have experienced with other vendors.\"   \n\nThe ease of the initial WAF rollout motivated EQT to displace its incumbent vendor for [DNS record management](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/) with Cloudflare. \n\n\"We weren't looking for a new DNS management solution,\" says Kristian Petersen, EQT Group SRE Team lead, \"But we quickly recognized that we could reduce our operational complexity with Cloudflare. By putting everything in Cloudflare's connectivity cloud, we streamlined service management and improved our security by limiting the potential for human error.\"\n\nToday, Cloudflare manages 5 primary and 70 secondary domains for EQT, improves the performance of those websites with caching and dynamic content delivery via a [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/), and protects them from threats like [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/). \n\n\"Cloudflare WAF, DDoS, and DNS Management are more robust, reliable, easier to use, and throw fewer false positives than any solution I have experienced,\" says Petersen. \"Because of that, we depend more and more on Cloudflare.\"  \n\nImpressed by its early results, EQT continues to expand its use of Cloudflare applications. To transform the user experience and [improve application security](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) across its operations in China, EQT adopted the newly introduced Cloudflare China Zero Trust/WARP solution. This provides  EQT users behind the Great Firewall with protection and performant, reliable network access consistent with the rest of the company's global workforce — all on the Cloudflare platform.    \n\nEQT also leveraged the Cloudflare Developer Platform, specifically Workers, to manage caching and dynamic content delivery and further improve the performance of its public websites. In addition to providing performance benefits, the Workers configuration allows EQT to completely isolate its public websites from its cloud-hosted applications, protecting critical internal systems from [potential threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/).    \n\n### __Securing and scaling access to self-hosted cloud applications__\n\nEQT's cloud migration in 2017 set in motion efforts to reimagine how employees accessed internal resources.\n\nPreviously, EQT relied on traditional tools like Microsoft's on-premises Active Directory to set access policies for its on-prem apps. Complicating matters, briefly after its cloud migration, EQT relied on a mix of its own custom proxies and on-premise VPN, which were, according to Petersen, \"a lot of pain to maintain\" and \"not always secure.\" \n\nAt the same time, EQT was focusing on building its own internal applications to drive business growth, and in turn, hiring more developers who needed safe, streamlined access. One of EQT's major internal projects is [Motherbrain](https://eqtgroup.com/motherbrain/), a proprietary AI language model for identifying and analyzing investment opportunities.  \n\n\"The custom solutions we developed were fine when we had one or two local applications to protect,\" says Petersen. \"But we soon had over 20 proprietary web applications that were used every day for important work by a growing number of users. When Cloudflare showed us its portfolio of Zero Trust security services, it was exactly what we needed.\"\n\nToday, EQT protects access to all self-hosted applications for all employees and contractors using Cloudflare Access, a [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/) service. Using a secure access service edge (SASE) and secure service edge (SSE) approach, Cloudflare authenticates a request to an application only after verifying a user's identity – in this case, based on integration with EQT's identity provider, Okta. \n\nEQT's security teams value that they can strengthen security with default-deny, least-privilege policies that are consistent with [Zero Trust best practices](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/), while still streamlining the experience for their employees. \n\n\"The experience for end users is very smooth, and using a centralized service like Cloudflare to manage application access policies makes it easier for our IT and security teams,\" says Gonçalves. \"Plus, we now have visibility into who is using each of our services, which helps us improve our security holistically.\"\n\nEQT has also been able to automate the vast majority of the policy configuration process via Cloudflare [integration with Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/), the infrastructure-as-code tool. Before Cloudflare, changing or creating application access policies could take up to a full week, now the process takes five minutes.\n\n\"The time saved is a radical shift for us and allows our teams to focus on more strategic efforts,\" says Gonçalves.\n\nEQT's positive experiences with Cloudflare have encouraged the company to continue growing the partnership. The manageability, ease of implementation, user-friendly interface, and extensive functionality of the Cloudflare platform have led the company to reconsider its attitude toward consolidation. The unified Cloudflare ecosystem with its core Application Services — WAF, DDoS Protection, and DNS and Bot Management solutions — alongside the Cloudflare Developer Platform and Cloudflare Zero Trust, SASE/SSE network security have become the foundations of EQT's connectivity cloud. \n\n\"We have always taken a best-of-breed approach to our IT and security stack,\" says Gonçalves. \"We are not afraid of killing security services that don't work, but, with everything Cloudflare offers and the positive experiences we've had, we keep increasing our adoption of a unified solution. That's a very positive sign for the future.\" \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Carrefour replaces 5 independent solutions with Cloudflare's integrated platform, bolstering security and staff efficiency while cutting costs__\n\nSince opening its first shop in 1960, Carrefour has become the eighth largest retailer in the world by revenue. The group boasts a network of 12,000+ stores in more than 30 countries and records more than 11 million transactions every day. \n\nCarrefour is constantly evolving in ways that drive transformation in the retail industry. In 1963, for example, the group opened the first European hypermarché, which combines a large supermarket and a department store under one roof. And when the digital age arrived, the  company swiftly embraced ecommerce. Today, online sales represent a growing percentage of revenue, as customers prefer to shop online and either pick up orders in-store or have orders delivered to their homes.\n\n### __Challenge: Improve security and reduce operational complexity by consolidating many tools into a unique, integrated platform__\n\nIn recent years, Carrefour's ecommerce sites experienced an upsurge in highly targeted and increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, including DDoS, bots, phishing, and ransomware. The previous security approach, which included bot management tools, web application firewall, multiple vendors for content optimization, traffic management, and customer account management, was no longer adequate. The staff had to manage five security tools independently, which hampered incident resolution. Moreover, significant latency issues were negatively impacting the customer experience in some geographies.\n\n\"The interlacing of multiple tools complicated coordination and control of the architecture and required specific skills spread across different departments. Our operational staff had to struggle to manage the infrastructure effectively,\" Cécile recalls. \"Additionally, the lack of integration across tools made investigating and resolving security and performance issues a complex and time-consuming effort.\" \n\nAccording to Cécile, the IT staff began looking for a solution to strengthen the security of Carrefour's retail sites. \"With the number and scope of attacks constantly increasing, we were reaching the end of what our existing setup was capable of handling,\" he notes.\n\nThe operations team devised a plan to enhance site security by initially integrating system responses at the application level. However, they realized that this approach was not enough and a complementary approach would be needed to deal with the large volume of applications. The team then decided to explore alternative solutions that would not only maintain a high level of perimeter security but also leverage existing functionalities, such as content acceleration, waiting rooms, and bot management. By taking this approach, the team was able to create a more comprehensive strategy that effectively tackled the issue while maximizing the utility of the platform's features. \"By reducing the number of tools to two or three, we were already seeing big results in terms of simplicity, performance, investigation times, and security,\" Cécile explains.\n\nHowever, Carrefour needed even more robust security and faster performance to support its ambitious ecommerce strategy. \n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare delivers highly effective global security at substantially lower operational costs__\n\nCloudflare turned out to be the ideal solution for Carrefour's security and performance enhancements. \"We were pleasantly surprised to discover that with Cloudflare's comprehensive and fully integrated approach, we could replace five security tools with a single platform,\" Cécile says.\" Plus, the functionality is clearly better than that of other vendors. Bot Management is especially effective, delivering very few false positives.\" \n\nThe Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides visibility into and [protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) against security threats to applications with WAF attack scores calculated by machine learning and content scanning analytics. Cloudflare Bot Management enables the operational security team to distinguish between good bots and bad ones and to block malicious bot traffic on Carrefour ecommerce sites.\n\nWith its global edge network, Cloudflare serves content much closer to Carrefour customers. Consequently, Carrefour was able to eliminate latency issues, which had been problematic for customers in South America. \"With Cloudflare's many points of operation around the world, our performance issues disappeared,\" says Cécile. \"The result is a significantly improved customer experience.\" Carrefour is also benefiting from functionality such as rate limiting and smart traffic routing, which yield additional performance improvements. Rate limiting protects websites and API endpoints from suspicious and excessive requests, while smart routing chooses less congested routes through the network to speed content delivery.\n\n### __Rapid rollout delivers significant benefits to Cloudflare and its customers__\n\nCarrefour conducted a phased rollout of Cloudflare, initially limiting the scope of the project to its French ecommerce site. That site handles approximately 1.5 million requests per day with a daily network load of 4TB. \n\n\"The initial results assured us that Cloudflare could bear the load,\" Cécile explains. \"The results were so conclusive that we decided to quickly switch all of our sites, about 400 worldwide, to Cloudflare. Cloudflare works with APIs, which greatly simplifies deployment. As a result, we were able to set up our first sites in less than a day. And thanks to a small script we created, additional site setups take less than 10 minutes each. So we were able to complete the entire rollout in a few months.\"\n\nAs a result of vendor consolidation, Carrefour has not only optimized architecture costs but also achieved stronger security and increased visibility over and control of its environment. All acceleration, [optimization](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/), and security tasks are now centralized in the operational security team, boosting efficiency. \n\n\"We are now accomplishing more with a smaller team and are more responsive when issues arise,\" Cécile notes. \"We can now find the source of an incident and resolve it in 25% of the time  it previously took.\" Cécile adds that Carrefour also gains consistency through a global policy based on predefined rules for all sites. \n\nAdopting Cloudflare also benefits Carrefour customers. Stronger security, reduced incident resolution times, and more effective bot detection translate into a smoother and more secure customer experience, and that means a higher level of customer satisfaction for more durable customer loyalty.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Consolidating security across employees, applications, and networks to accelerate digital transformation__\n\nFounded in 1983, Applied Systems builds SaaS solutions for the insurance industry. Based in Chicago, the company has over 2,500 employees across the US, UK, Canada, Western Europe, and India. Applied Systems is a global leader in the insurance industry, serving independent insurance brokerages of all sizes – from international and enterprise companies to local agencies and SMBs.\n\nApplied Systems has won global recognition for its pioneering approach to insurtech, including awards as the [Best Broker Software Management House](https://awards.insurancetimes.co.uk/techawards/winners4568/) in the UK for 2022 by Insurance Times and first place in its category at the [US 2023 Golden Bridge Business and Innovation Awards.](https://www1.appliedsystems.com/en-us/news/press-releases/2023/applied-systems-wins-gold-in-the-15th-annual-2023-golden-bridge-awards/)\n\n### __Challenge: Accelerating digital transformation__\n\nSecurity has always been of paramount importance to Applied Systems. The company must safeguard large volumes of financial data, payment records, personally identifiable information (PII), and other regulated and sensitive classes of information for its insurance customers.\n\nWith the introduction of a new CEO and executive team in 2019, Applied has increasingly prioritized digital transformation initiatives to help it serve larger, more demanding enterprise customers. When Chief Information Security Officer Tanner Randolph started in 2021, this meant re-evaluating Applied's technology architecture, seeking opportunities to become more agile, more efficient, and more secure. \n\n\"Applied is on a journey. We're rapidly accelerating into a cloud-native company,\" he says. \"When I joined, we had various components from different security vendors like Zscaler and Cisco and different networking paths to our data centers. Over the past few years, we've really focused on consolidating around a unified security and networking stack.\"\n\nStarting in 2022, Applied Systems began consolidating large swaths of security and networking functionalities on Cloudflare, including:\n\n- Protections and performance enhancements across public-facing websites and apps\n- [Secure](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/) and scalable connectivity across network infrastructure\n- Zero Trust security posture for employees and internal resources\n\n\"By consolidating controls onto Cloudflare rather than the many control planes of multiple-vendor systems, my teams can focus on driving the business forward,\" he continues. \" I don't know of a lot of security teams that can say that.\" \n\n### __Protecting websites and applications__\n\nOne major impetus for evaluating Cloudflare was the need to modernize software experiences for customers, particularly as they migrated functionality from Applied Systems' heritage thick client apps to SaaS environments.\n\n\"We wanted to build a partnership with a vendor that was cloud-native and understood what cloud native customers expected,\" says Randolph. \"That way, we could consistently deliver great and secure experiences for our customers across our newest applications.\"\n\nApplied Systems has deployed Cloudflare's application services, including [web application firewall (WAF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/), [content delivery network (CDN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cdn/), [DDoS mitigation](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/), and [rate limiting](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/rate-limiting/), to block malicious traffic and improve performance across its apps. According to Randolph, the reliability of Cloudflare has helped ease the process of migrating Applied Systems' web-facing apps to the cloud.\n\n\"Cloudflare has been extremely performant and consistent in securing our applications against malicious traffic and reducing latency across the board,\" he says. \n\n### __Securing network connections__\n\nTo support its business growth and ambitions, Applied Systems has streamlined its architecture for network connectivity with Cloudflare, specifically implementing [Magic Transit](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/) and [Magic Firewall](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-firewall/), a [firewall-as-a-service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-a-cloud-firewall/). Together, as the company has grown, these services have accelerated network traffic, protected against threats (including L3 DDoS attacks), and enabled administrators to apply security filters when necessary.\n\n\"Cloudflare scales with us — that's our biggest win,\" says Randolph. \"As our largest customers switch over to our cloud-native deployments, Cloudflare can handle the increased traffic without us adding network appliances or buying additional bandwidth. Using our previous vendors would have more than doubled our costs.\"\n\nApplied Systems has been particularly agile in expanding and layering firewall policies. Its first firewall policies were basic — like blocking traffic from certain geographies. Over time, however, Applied Systems has begun writing its own firewall rules based on [log data](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/zone/firewall_events/) analyzed in its [SIEM](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-siem/) and automating the deployment of those custom rules by leveraging Cloudflare's [API-based integration with Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/), the infrastructure-as-code tool.\n\n\"We have seen a dramatic reduction in the amount of threat traffic. Being able to write universal rules across all of our data centers is amazing,\" he says. \"Adopting DevOps best practices and using automation has made us extremely efficient at rolling out changes with Cloudflare.\"\n\n### __Adopting Zero Trust and replacing Zscaler and Cisco__\n\nAdopting a [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/) architecture was a top priority for Randolph when he joined. \n\nPreviously, Applied Systems used Zscaler and Cisco services — specifically, Zscaler Internet Access for outbound connections to the Internet and Cisco AnyConnect VPN for access to internal apps. According to Randolph, managing these disparate point solutions created complexity and visibility gaps for his team and projected to be expensive in the long run as the company continues to grow. \n\nHe also cited a few pain points specific to each service:\nDevelopers complained frequently about Zscaler blocking work-critical websites and hurting productivity, and in response, Applied Systems began relaxing policies and accepting more risk than it wanted.\nThe Cisco AnyConnect VPN was not only sluggish for end users, but also created excessive risk by granting employees access to the entire network, as opposed to verifying each request to specific apps. \n\nReplacing these vendors with [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/) has helped Applied to unify security controls across web, cloud, and private app environments. \n\n\"We have received great feedback on Cloudflare Zero Trust — it's easier to deploy and better for our employees,\" he says. \"We are much more secure as an organization with the same amount of time available to us.\"\n\n### __Use case: Default-deny access to self-hosted apps__\n\nSpecifically, Cloudflare's Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service has helped Applied Systems [implement more granular policies](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/how-to-implement-zero-trust/) across its self-hosted applications and infrastructure for all 2500+ employees.\n\n\"Cloudflare has helped us transition from a default-allow to a default-deny security posture,\" Randolph says. \"We have posture checking in place, so we can grant access based on what we know about what user group you're in, what device you're on, and more.\"\n\nThe security team has flexibility to apply more rigorous or less rigorous controls to meet different user needs and fit the risk level of the application. For example, employees with Cloudflare's device client deployed on a personal device can still access their HR portal to submit vacation requests, but developers must be on a managed device and pass more stringent checks to access comparatively higher-risk production environments.\n\n### __Use case: Securing emerging AI tools and protecting data__\n\nCloudflare Zero Trust also helps Applied Systems secure how users interact with and use sensitive data in emerging artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT.\n\nSpecifically, Applied runs the public instance of ChatGPT in a Cloudflare [isolated browser](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-browser-isolation/). By running all web code for this ChatGPT tool on the Cloudflare network, Randolph's security team can control how users manipulate data in the tool — including restricting download, upload, copy-paste, and more.\n\n\"We wanted to let employees take advantage of AI while keeping it safe,\" says Randolph. \"We prevent users from copying and pasting sensitive data from other apps into our isolated instance of ChatGPT, which prevents a lot of company info from being exposed to the tool.\"\n\nIsolating ChatGPT has helped the company be more secure while experimenting with the tool, which in turn gave confidence for Applied Systems to build and improve its own instance in Slack. This use case speaks to Randolph's broader approach to data protection: security controls should be \"pragmatic\" and not come at the expense of workforce productivity. \n\n\"We're taking this philosophy to email,\" he says. \"People want to be able to check their personal email, but they don't necessarily need to be able to copy/paste, upload/download in their personal email.\"\n\nDeploying Cloudflare services like [email security](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email-security/), [cloud access security broker (CASB)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-casb/), and [data loss prevention (DLP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dlp/) will help Randolph and team continue to extend control and visibility across more environments and data. The business will be equipped not only to protect information, but also to comply with evolving regulations across the U.S. and globally.\n\n\"When we get asked about regulatory compliance by our customers, we can just tell the CISO on the other side that we are Cloudflare customers and explain the products we are using,\" he says. \"That usually answers the questions they would normally ask.\"\n\n### __What's next__\n\nInvesting in new security controls goes hand-in-hand with investing in a high-quality IT and security experience. To that end, Applied Systems was an early adopter of Cloudflare [Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX).](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-digital-experience-monitoring/) DEX provides historical and real-time visibility into end user and device connectivity, application performance, and network connections across an organization.\n\n\"The more information we have available to us, the more effective my teams can be in delivering IT that keeps our employees productive,\" says Randolph. \"Tools like Cloudflare DEX have the potential to make a huge difference in equipping us with the visibility and insights to drive future development decisions.\"\n\n### __Working with Cloudflare__\n\nIn just a few years, Applied Systems has already made significant progress consolidating and modernizing security across its employees, [applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/), and network with Cloudflare. \n\nWorking so closely with Cloudflare across multiple types of deployments has helped strengthen the responsiveness and quality of customer support over time, particularly as Cloudflare's teams become more familiar with Applied's architecture.\n\n\"I can see the difference on a month-to-month basis in terms of the quality of the product and support,\" says Randolph. \"With Cloudflare backing us, my teams work more effectively and can focus on our security strategy.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Caliente.mx — Performance, simplicity, and security with a single vendor solution from Cloudflare__\n\nCaliente.mx is Mexico's number-one online gaming and live sports betting platform. It provides over 220 million monthly visitors with a secure, convenient online gaming and betting experience. In addition to hosting slot machines, blackjack, and other popular casino games, the site allows players to place live bets on in-progress sports events. \n\nTo keep its users engaged, Caliente.mx streams sports matches from around the world, featuring international leagues (NFL, NBA, Champions League, etc.), National Leagues (LMB, LNBP), major tournaments, and much more.\n\n### __Challenges: Avoiding compromise — finding the right balance between security, scalability, and a performant user experience__\n\nAs one of the top ten most-visited websites in Mexico, Caliente.mx operates in a marketplace where annual revenue from regulated online gaming exceeds USD 500 million. That revenue continues to grow as Mexico's population of 128 million passes 90% mobile and internet penetration.\n\nTo capitalize on that growth, Caliente.mx had clear priorities. First came data security — Caliente.mx sought to protect its customers against fraud and safeguard customer financial and personal identifiable information (PII) while securing its internal data and cloud infrastructure. \n\n\"Our largest issue was malicious third parties trying to access our users' accounts or personal information, either manually or by using automated bots,\" explains Lior Gross, Director of Software Development at Caliente.mx. \"Stopping those attacks was the key to differentiating ourselves and earning customer trust. Everybody needed to know they could rely on us.\" \n\nNext on Caliente.mx's list was improving the site's performance and scalability. To provide its customers with the best possible live-action betting and sports viewing experience, the company needed to stream content in real time to ensure accurate betting. It needed to ensure lag-free service no matter the size of the event, the number of players, or where in Mexico, Central, or South America a customer logged in. \n\n\"Our services needed to be as fast as a televised broadcast, if not faster — we didn't want our customers receiving old information,\" says Gross. \"We needed a streaming and content delivery solution that could give us the highest throughput and lowest possible latency across our entire customer base, not just those nearest the US.\" \n\nFinally, the company wanted a solution that was as easy to implement and maintain as it was effective.\n\n\"It has always been a struggle to keep our systems both secure and performant,\" Gross explains. \"We didn't want to compromise — we wanted a single solution to provide our users with the safest, most responsive gaming experience possible.\"\n\nTo refocus on improving the Caliente.mx experience and better attract and retain customers, Caliente wanted to eradicate the complexity of maintaining multiple vendor systems and relationships.   \n\n### __Solution: A single solution — Securing websites and infrastructure with Cloudflare Application Services and Zero Trust__ \n\nAfter investigating the products of several networking and security providers, Caliente.mx selected Cloudflare. The single-vendor Cloudflare platform stood out from the competition based on the flexibility and rich functionality of its comprehensive platform and the wide-ranging coverage of its global network.   \n\n\"Cloudflare offered everything we needed. We didn't have to make concessions,\" says Gross. \"It was a holistic solution with optimized tools that met all of our needs, right down to servers in cities around Mexico.\" \n\nCaliente.mx began its journey by implementing Cloudflare [application security and performance services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/). Working with the Cloudflare team to unify its security and analytical tools under the  Cloudflare interface, Caliente.mx upgraded its defensive stance against data scrapers, automated threats, and credential harvesters with the [Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/), [DDoS Protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/), and [Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/bot-management/). The single source of truth provided by a consolidated solution immediately improved the team's visibility into the business. \n\n\"Knowledge is power — analyzing the data that passes through Cloudflare helps us better protect our customers' money and information by allowing us to rapidly identify and eliminate vulnerabilities we previously couldn't see,\" says Gross. \"Cloudflare improved our security posture and significantly reduced the number of attacks on our networks and customers.\"\n\nNext, Caliente.mx turned to Cloudflare to optimize internal security and work towards the company's goal of securing and simplifying employee access to cloud-based resources. Access, the Cloudflare Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) tool, has allowed the company to easily secure remote access to its cloud-based internal web applications and content management systems. \n\n\"Zero Trust allows us to protect our sensitive work environments without the complexity of specialized hardware or legacy tools,\" says Gross. \"Cloudflare is more secure, and even our less technical teams can do their jobs without the friction common to a traditional VPN. As proof of our success, with Access, we rarely receive support requests from employees trying to log in to do their jobs.\"\n\n### __Improving scalability and performance on the network edge with the Cloudflare Developer Platform — Workers and Pages__\n\nWith its website, [applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/), and employee access secure, Caliente.mx focused on improving the Caliente.mx user experience by increasing site performance. To achieve this, in keeping with its vendor consolidation initiative, the company harnessed the Cloudflare Developer Platform. The company's deployment included Cloudflare Workers, Pages, Stream, and R2 — all highly-configurable, inter-compatible, and edge-based development tools and services.    \n\nWorkers and Pages provided the development teams at Caliente.mx with a cost-effective method of modernizing old code and moving applications out onto the global network. Using the Developer Platform, Caliente.mx could rapidly scale services and deploy applications to the global network nearest the company's users. \n\n\"The Cloudflare Developer Platform simplifies our jobs as developers, making complex tasks more manageable,\" says Gross. \"Using Cloudflare we have been able to clean up our code and streamline the way we configure, deploy and modify our applications\".\n\nUsed together, the Cloudflare CDN, Pages, and Workers ensure that static and dynamic content delivery for the Caliente.mx gaming and live betting applications is nearly instantaneous. \n\n### __Faultless live video delivery with Stream__\n\nTo further enhance the user experience, Caliente.mx also implemented Cloudflare Stream to ensure faultless delivery of the platform's live event video broadcasts. Using Cloudflare Stream on the network edge to avoid poor performance across Mexico and Latin America is a critical part of the company's strategy to scale its [live video streams](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/live-streaming/) alongside the growing Caliente.mx user base. \n\n\"With Cloudflare Stream, our users see every live event with the lowest latency possible. There are no synchronization issues updating the odds, and they will never miss a bet or hear their neighbors cheering before they see the touchdown,\" says Gross.\n\n### __Cutting overheads with R2__\n\nFurther enhancing performance while keeping Caliente's costs down is R2, the S3-compatible Cloudflare storage platform. Fully integrated with Workers, the Cloudflare global network, and the rest of the Cloudflare platform, R2 allows Caliente to store its data on the edge without vendor lock-in or the expense of accessing it.  \n\n\"In addition to serious performance gains, R2 saves Caliente.mx thousands of dollars each month in egress fees,\" says Gross \"Cloudflare eliminated those costs entirely — we no longer have the overhead of connecting multiple services and cloud providers.\"  \n\nDriven in part by unmatched Cloudflare performance and support throughout Mexico and Latin America, Caliente.mx intends to continue expanding its use of Zero Trust to secure its office and production environments.\n\n\"We want Cloudflare to secure all our internal systems,\" says Gross. \"Speaking Spanish with our local and US-based Cloudflare teams makes it much easier for us to pass information back and forth. That strong commitment to working in Mexico is one of the reasons we are always looking for new ways to improve using Cloudflare tools.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Irish Cancer Society leverages Cloudflare to make its annual day of giving a huge success__\n\nAn estimated 44,000 people in Ireland are diagnosed with cancer each year. The mission of the Irish Cancer Society is to save and improve their lives. The society provides free information and care, raises funds for cancer research, and works with government officials to improve the Irish healthcare system for cancer patients.\n\nAs a nonprofit, the society relies on donations. And while fundraising occurs year-round, the vast majority of donations occur in March during the society's annual Daffodil Day event.\n\nThe most recent Daffodil Day brought in over €5,000,000 to fund services such as informational booklets and webpages, night nursing services, volunteer drivers, free phone support, and Daffodil information centers. The society also funds state-of-the-art cancer research and life-saving trials. \n\nApproximately one-quarter of donations are received online through the society's website. Consequently, keeping the website online — while also providing fast response times — is critical to their fundraising and support efforts.\n\n### __Challenge: Deliver 100% availability during peak fundraising times__\n\nIn 2020, Ireland's Friday night Late Late Show featured the Irish Cancer Society's Daffodil Day, during which celebrities encouraged viewers to donate to the society. The show generated an unexpectedly large amount of website traffic. During the peak, IT staff struggled to keep the society's online cancer information services available.\n\nDuring the 2021 fundraising period, the staff decided to redirect donor traffic to a Lambda service running in AWS. Unfortunately, that approach rendered cancer information services unavailable.\n\nMoving forward, the staff needed to find a way to keep cancer information services readily available, while also boosting web page response times. Only a few weeks remained before Daffodil Day, so the pressure was on. \n\nMoreover, this year, Ireland's national rugby team would be talking up Daffodil Day on The Late Late Show. Consequently, the society was expecting an unprecedented number of viewers, which would likely cause donation traffic to reach extraordinarily high levels. Being prepared for the event was a top priority.\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare's rapid response to a tight onboarding deadline helped ensure successful fundraising with 2X more traffic than the previous year__\n\nHead of Technology Transformation Mark Coffey and his staff were familiar with Cloudflare and impressed with the company's reputation. After investigating multiple solutions, they determined that Cloudflare was the best option for tackling the upcoming day of giving. \n\nWith that crucial day only weeks away, the society approached Cloudflare for help to get the new services tuned and running smoothly. Cloudflare recognized the urgency of the situation and immediately set up a technical support call. With Cloudflare's expert assistance, the staff was able to implement caching and the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) in time to be fully operational for Daffodil Day. Cloudflare helped the society set up a single-page donation form, through which donors could make payments via a third-party fundraising platform. By redirecting donor traffic away from their main website, the society was able to keep cancer support services available even while experiencing traffic spikes.\n\nAs expected, traffic spiked during The Late Late Show.\n\n![ICS Graph 1](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6Flxn1QGW1fhN2oBLhbUCO/d8ab78f01e324e7ecf67bbe2473ede56/image005__1_.png)\n\n\"During the Daffodil Day peak, we redirected 90% of donor traffic away from our website to Cloudflare, allowing us to keep our cancer information and support services available for people who needed them,\" Coffey recalls. \n\nThe staff closely monitored website performance and was able to keep the site running with faster response times and no availability issues, even though traffic on Daffodil Day was 100% higher than the previous year.\n\n![ICS Chart 2](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2jU94qdZYOgoP2n6JKZ1ti/9820f62e3fb7c127eb57d6c7700228cf/unnamed__2_.png)\n\n\"We measured response times during the week leading up to this year's Daffodil Day, and then again after enabling Cloudflare,\" Coffey notes. \"Response times were 60% faster with Cloudflare.\" \n\n### __Eliminating credit card fraud__\n\nThe society also had security concerns such as DDoS attacks and malicious bots. Fraudulent credit card transactions were of particular concern. During the 2022 Daffodil Day, the finance team had alerted Coffey about these transactions and how much they were costing the nonprofit.\n\nTo counteract this, the staff enabled the Cloudflare WAF geolocation capability to flag transactions from certain locales and submit them for additional verification processes. The fraudulent transactions stopped immediately. The finance team was able to quantify the impact the following month, reporting that the annual volume was nearly 200,000 fraudulent charges.\n\n\"Our payment processing vendor charges us three cents per fraudulent transaction,\" Coffey says. \"That amounts to around €6,000 a year. The extra Cloudflare verification saves us that money, which is better spent on services for cancer patients and their families.\"\n\n### __Building on success with Cloudflare__\n\nCoffey, his team, and senior management are all delighted with the successes Cloudflare helped the society achieve. \"We are actively looking for ways to continue improving our site's performance and security,\" he explains. \"We are starting a proof of concept with the Cloudflare Zero Trust platform, which will reduce reliance on VPN hardware for remote access while enhancing security.\" \n\nSolutions like Cloudflare Zero Trust are available to the Irish Cancer Society through Project Galileo, a Cloudflare programme that offers significant discounts to nonprofits. The Irish Cancer Society joined [Project Galileo](https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/) shortly after Daffodil Day as they plan to continue working with Cloudflare for years to come.\n\n\"Other vendors give us heavy discounts, but Project Galileo's discount structure goes above and beyond what others provide,\" Coffey concludes. \"It's very, very generous. And it gives us an affordable way to leverage Cloudflare's extensive functionality in support of our mission to assist cancer patients and their families.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Melbourne Airport streamlined their complex cyber security infrastructure and mitigated DDoS threats from potential hacktivists by using Cloudflare to ensure uptime for all traveller services ",
						"longDescription": "## __Melbourne Airport uses Cloudflare to secure their infrastructure and protect against DDoS attacks__\n\nServing up to 25 million travellers annually, [Melbourne Airport](https://www.melbourneairport.com.au/) is the second-busiest airport in Australia. It currently serves nearly  40 airlines covering Pacific, European, Asian, North and South American destinations, and the many domestic routes that span Australia.\n\nIn keeping with Melbourne's mission to become Australia's favorite airport destination, a wide variety of IT-supported services make each passenger's trip through the 2023 Skytrax award-winning facility safe, enjoyable, and efficient.\n\n### __Challenge: Securing critical infrastructure in a complex technological ecosystem__\n\nDue to the important role the airport plays in connecting Australia with the world, keeping the facility and its travellers secure is a responsibility of national importance. To accomplish this, however, the technical and cybersecurity teams faced multiple challenges.\n\n\"Maintaining a strong security fabric is our key priority, and that covers the entire passenger experience. It starts curbside at home, extends through the terminal to the boarding gate, and onto the plane,\" explains Anthony Tomai, Melbourne Airport CIO. \"The entire airport is a broad technological ecosystem that supports a vast mix of enterprise and operational systems. I can't understate its complexity.\"\n\n\"We need to be very clear about who is on our infrastructure and how to protect it,\" adds Cheuk Wong, Melbourne Airport's Head of Cyber Security. \"When you add free public Wi-Fi into the mix, over 100,000 people connect to our network daily.\"\n\n### __Solution: Straightforward security with the Cloudflare WAF__\n\nMelbourne Airport security team evaluated several vendors and web security products. Of the choices, only Cloudflare ticked their boxes for a secure, scalable, and easy-to-implement security solution that also met regulatory requirements.\n\n\"Cloudflare was the best solution for us,\" says Tomai. \"People we talked to were saying good things — Cloudflare has an excellent reputation in the broader marketplace.\"\n\nThe airport began their security upgrades with the Cloudflare [web application firewall (WAF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/). The multi-layered Cloudflare defensive solution provided the airport with machine learning and threat intelligence insights, central management for all of their domains, Cloudflare managed rules, Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) rule sets, and powerful manual response options. \n\nSetup went smoothly and the team easily addressed their security concerns.\n\n\"Implementing Cloudflare was straightforward,\" says George Panagiotidis, Technology  Project Manager, at Melbourne Airport. \"It's rare we have the luxury of using a product that just works out of the box.\"\n\nThe airport security team was able to deploy the Cloudflare WAF across multiple domains without the need for manual configuration or automation. This meant the team could easily test out rulesets by logging traffic on a small group of hostnames before activating the WAF rules actress the system.\n\n\"With Cloudflare, we quickly strengthened our protections for our publicly-facing assets,\" says Evan Thomson, Melbourne Airport's Incident Response Manager. \"The Cloudflare WAF secured our externally exposed URLs and restricted problematic traffic from inappropriate international sources.\"\n\nCloudflare also improved the team's visibility into the traffic on the network and reduced the time they spend ensuring everything remains [secure](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/).\n\n\"We can recognize problems and make security adjustments in a rapidly, all from the  Cloudflare dashboard,\" says Thomson. \"It would have taken far longer in the past.\"   \n\n### __Keeping infrastructure DDoS attacks in check with Magic Transit__\n\nBased on their early success with Cloudflare, when recent creditable cyber threats were publicized in the world media, the team looked to Cloudflare to scale up their protections. By moving their network perimeter to the Cloudflare global network edge using [Magic Transit](https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/), the airport was able to secure their infrastructure instantly to defuse any DDoS threats.\n\n\"With Magic Transit in place, we were confident malicious traffic would not reach the airport infrastructure\", says Tomai.\n\n\"Overnight, Cloudflare implementation engineers helped us complete a huge piece of work in a very complex environment,\" says Panagiotidis. \"We expanded our Cloudflare protection from our web applications to our entire network. It was an A+ experience.\"\n\nBacked by Cloudflare's Magic Transit, the airport would be able to sidestep any potential DDoS attacks, which would allow the airport to avoid any costly downtime, delayed flights and inconvenience to travellers, and losing the public's trust.\n\n\"We are looking to Cloudflare for opportunities where we can better leverage our existing tooling, maximize value, and better understand our environment,\" says Wong.\n\nDescribing his interactions with Cloudflare to secure Melbourne Airport, Tomai reflects on the importance of trust for successful collaboration.\n\n\"It's all about the power of good partnerships — being able to get the best out of people who know how to do things better than you can. Cloudflare is a trusted partner to us now. We will continue to lean on the Cloudflare team for advice and support.\"",

						"longDescription": "## __Envato enhanced customer experience, ensured staff access to core applications, and protected their digital marketplace against DDoS attacks__\n\n[Envato](https://www.envato.com/) has grown from a garage startup in Sydney, Australia to a global business, shaping the creative industry with two of the most innovative and comprehensive creative products on the market: Envato Elements and Envato Market. \n\nWith over 2 million customers per year (ranging from independent designers and tech startups to established corporations like Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Nike, and Walmart) the business is dedicated to helping creatives thrive by enabling them to buy or sell creative assets across video, music, photo, graphics, fonts, website themes, code and more.\n\nIn 2022 Envato Authors (sellers) surpassed $1.3 billion USD in earnings across all its sites. Today, Envato has hundreds of staff across key offices in Melbourne, Guadalajara and in remote work locations wherever staff may live. \n\n### __Challenge: Stopping large-scale DDoS attacks and securing an international workforce__\n\nWith a global customer base and a distributed workforce, navigating international security is one of Envato's top priorities. \n\n\"Supporting and securing our customers and workforce is one of our focuses,\" says Ross Simpson, Envato's Senior Principal Security Engineer. \"Because we work with creators and clients globally, we also need to pay special attention to international security requirements.\" \n\nWith its prior vendors, Envato was vulnerable to [cyber threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/). \n\n\"Prior to partnering with Cloudflare over 5 years ago, we'd suffered denial of service and extortion attacks\" says Simpson, \"including one large-scale distributed denial of service attack that resulted in the entire Envato platform going down in one instance for a number of hours. This obviously is not ideal for an [ecommerce company](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/). It caused revenue and reputational damage to Envato.\" \n\nEnvato recognized the need to find a more effective, more modern security vendor.\n\n### __Solution: Blocking DDoS and other Internet-borne attacks with Cloudflare application security__\n\n\"Our research and the DDoS attack led us to Cloudflare,\" says Simpson. \"Although, like many organisations, we get attacks across our sites, now we rely on Cloudflare to secure us against significant threats.\"\n\nEnvato uses Cloudflare's [application security services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/) to protect their web apps, stop bad bots, and monitor for suspicious activity – all from a single management interface. \n\n\"Managed rules in the Cloudflare WAF block known attackers. We can also easily create and deploy custom rule sets to block bad behaviors specific to our sites. Cloudflare Rate Limiting adds another layer of protection to our sites and APIs against both malicious and accidental overloads,\" says Simpson. \n\nEnvato favors automation and infrastructure-as-code, and Cloudflare's systems are a good match. Configuration can be expressed in code, deployed within moments, and if needed, changes can be rolled back with little effort.\n\n### __Improving the global customer experience with the Cloudflare network and Argo Smart Routing__\nLeveraging Cloudflare as its [content delivery network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/) assists Envato to deliver consistently fast and reliable website experiences. \n\n\"Our origin servers are in the US, so we depend on the Cloudflare network in regions like South America, India, and Asia where we have large customer bases,\" says Simpson. \"Cloudflare gives us a significant increase in performance and reliability that assists us to deliver the experience our customers expect from Envato.\" \n\nEnvato uses [Argo Smart Routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/) to detect real-time congestion and route web traffic across the fastest and most reliable network paths. \n\n\"We have seen Cloudflare assist us in decreasing response times by ~50% on our flagship sites over a period of five years,\" says Simpson. \"That translates into a better user experience for our customers — when our sites are faster, customers engage.\" \n\nIn addition to enhancing the customer experience, Cloudflare has contributed to reducing Envato's bandwidth costs and helps them localize regional data. \n\n\"Since the introduction of Cloudflare, we have seen each month we offload more than 20 terabytes of data from our origin servers,\" says Simpson. \"That translates to monthly savings that wouldn't be possible without Cloudflare.\" \n\n### __Securing employee access to internal applications with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nWith their public-facing websites secure and [performant](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/), Envato turned to Cloudflare to secure employee access to internal applications and infrastructure. \n\n\"We're a cloud-native company with a global workforce. Our staff need to access key company resources from wherever they are in the world,\" says Simpson \"Cloudflare Zero Trust was a really good fit — a secure, effective, and simpler approach than traditional access controls.\" \n\nCloudflare Access, [a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/), equips Envato's IT and security teams with granular control over how users access internal applications – without maintaining lists of trusted IP addresses or complex VPN appliances. \n\n\"With Cloudflare, our employees enjoy seamless access to the tools they need to do their jobs. Cloudflare integrates with our existing identity provider to ensure consistent access across all of our internal apps,\" says Simpson, \"Cloudflare not only assists in protecting us, it simplifies our employee onboarding and offboarding processes.\"\n\nEnvato uses the WARP client and the Cloudflare Secure Web Gateway to add more granular control to sensitive information. \n\n\"With Cloudflare Access we can easily protect our applications,\" says Simpson. \"We use the Secure Web Gateway with WARP on a user's machine to meet more complex security and regulatory requirements.\" \n\n### __Anonymizing user data with Cloudflare Workers__\n\nEnvato uses Workers, the Cloudflare developer service, to anonymize user data and remove sensitive information from requests to third-party and partner applications. Workers also adds security headers to responses before they go out to customers. \n\n\"Workers is an important tool in our developer toolbox — another way we prevent data leakage and increase our security posture,\" says Simpson. \"We have replaced some applications entirely with Workers. Our architects and developers often reach for Workers.\" \n\nAccording to Simpson, in addition to Cloudflare functionality, customer service has played an important role in Envato's success using the Cloudflare platform. \n\n\"Support was excellent even before we committed to anything. Our early interactions with the team gave us confidence that Cloudflare was the solution for us,\" he says. \"That high level of customer service has continued to this day. It's been a great value, and we still have an incredible Cloudflare team supporting us.\" \n\nMoving forward, Envato plans to further improve their security posture using Cloudflare's advanced bot management and web security suites. \n\n\"Expanding with Cloudflare just makes sense,\" Simpson says \"Cloudflare takes care of the complex and tedious stuff required to secure and run our web applications and lets us focus on what we really care about — delivering better products and experiences to our customers.\"",

						"longDescription": "## __BigScoots improves customer site performance and security with Cloudflare__\n\n[BigScoots](https://www.bigscoots.com/) has been operating for 13 years as a fully managed WordPress hosting provider that offers site specific, done-for-you premium management and services for website owners of all shapes and sizes. They provide WordPress site and plugin management, around the clock proactive monitoring, DDoS protection, enhanced security, infinite scalability, database optimization, core vital improvements and 24/7/365 with ~90-second response support for a customer base of 10,000+ users who generate many billions of site visits each month.\n\nDriven by a nimble team of experts who are dedicated to the success of their clients, they are able to focus the time and attention where it matters most, addressing performance, security, and reliability concerns for brand-new WordPress websites, established enterprises, and everything in between. \n\n### __Challenge: Always improving the customer experience__\n\nBigScoots stays laser focused on the level of service they provide to their hosted websites. The BigScoots team manages and optimizes customer's WordPress sites and is always looking for ways to reduce latency, boost performance and eliminate other pain points for their customers.\n\nSite performance can be highly dependent on external factors, such as the speed of DNS lookups, various forms of cache, and the performance of the network between the user and the server. By leveraging Cloudflare's robust performance and security network rather than building these services in-house, BigScoots is able to continue to stay focused on customer management, while also achieving an efficient, scalable, secure and performance oriented network.\n\n### __Cloudflare Magic Transit improves uptime, response time and attack mitigation__\n\nFor BigScoots, uptime is critical, and they were seeking better ways to handle DDoS attacks with their current provider. The company needed to be able to identify any ongoing attacks and manually route attack traffic to a scrubbing center; a process that incurred mitigation delays  for their customers. Also, managing DDoS traffic manually took time and resources away from other areas of customer service.\n\nTo meet the BigScoots customer service goals, they knew they needed always-on DDoS protection, but were concerned about the negative impacts it could have on latency. Often, always-on DDoS protection adds latency as inbound traffic is routed through one of the provider's few DDoS scrubbing locations.\n\nWith Cloudflare, this wasn't a problem.\n\n\"With Cloudflare, we've actually seen improved network latency as a result of enabling Magic Transit with always-on DDoS protection,\" said Scott Stapley, BigScoot's CEO.\n\nInbound traffic is routed over Cloudflare's optimized, global network, which offers better performance than the public Internet. In addition to providing improved network performance, Magic Transit also offered peace of mind to BigScoots' team by completely eliminating the threat of volumetric DDoS attacks.\n\nStapley commented, \"Recently, we experienced a 1 Tbps attack and it wasn't even noticed. I just happened to be in the dashboard at the time and saw the huge traffic peak.\"\n\nFor BigScoots, even a short blip in availability has a negative impact on their customer experience — and large-scale attacks can degrade or destroy their network performance. Since Cloudflare sits in front of BigScoots' uplinks, DDoS traffic is scrubbed (and optimized!) before it hits any potential bottlenecks, and volumetric attacks are eliminated without causing any downtime for BigScoots and their customers.\n\n### __Cloudflare optimizes network performance__\n\nBigScoots' relationship with Cloudflare began more than a decade ago when they adopted Cloudflare's managed DNS and CDN services to cache webpages and static content to improve customer website performance. Before that, BigScoots handled DNS entries for their clients internally; a process that demanded significant human resources.\n\nSwitching over to Cloudflare DNS helped improve both performance and security for their customers, while still allowing BigScoots to help manage their customers DNS - a unique aspect of BigScoots that allows for a more hands on level of management. The Cloudflare global network spans 300+ data centers worldwide, enabling DNS lookup speeds of 11 ms (on average) and propagation of DNS record updates in less than five seconds. Also, Cloudflare DNS provides robust protection against DNS record poisoning, zone transfers, and other potential security threats.\n\nWith the successful deployment of managed DNS, BigScoots took further advantage of the Cloudflare network to improve performance and reliability. Cloudflare helped reduce the latency of accessing cached content and the load on BigScoots' origin servers.\n\nCloudflare's API-first architecture is also a major benefit for BigScoots, especially when onboarding new customers. BigScoots' onboarding portal was configured to automatically provision accounts and onboard customers to Cloudflare services and configure their DNS settings via prebuilt API queries.\n\nAccording to Stapley,\"Through our WPO portal and the Cloudflare API, we've streamlined the onboarding of new sites. This efficiency reduces manual tasks which in our case completely eliminates mistakes, allowing us to concentrate on ensuring the highest quality of service.\"\n\nBigScoots and Cloudflare are both focused on improving the customer experience by removing common pain points and sources of friction. According to Stapley, working with Cloudflare has empowered BigScoots to allocate more time and attention to delivering essential services to their customers. \n\n\"BigScoots is all about our service and constantly asking 'what can we do better?'

						"longDescription": "## __boohoo enhances online shopping by leveraging Cloudflare to protect its multi-brand, geographically dispersed environment from bot attacks and malicious API access__\n\nboohoo Group's innovative global brands targeting young, value-oriented customers have made the company a leader in the ecommerce fashion market. Based in Manchester, England, the company generates nearly £2 billion in sales annually.\n\nThe group's 13 brands, including PrettyLittleThing, Nasty Gal, and Debenhams, target a market of more than 500 million potential customers around the world. All brands, except Debenhams, conduct business solely online. \n\nAs an [online retailer](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/), boohoo faces many challenges, including intense competition, tight margins, and constantly changing customer interests and expectations. To ensure an optimal customer experience, the IT organization has developed a formidable technology platform comprising best-in-class systems. The platform enables boohoo to operate its huge volume business with efficiency and accuracy. Protecting that platform from cyber attacks is essential for securing customer and company data from unauthorized access and streamlining the shopping experience.\n\n### __Challenge: Mitigate the risk of cyber threats that could disrupt ecommerce and affect revenue__\n\nboohoo continuously invests in systems, infrastructure, and technology to ensure an optimal and secure online shopping experience. In particular, the company is implementing cyber security tools to reduce the risk of application, system, and operational downtime that might affect trading and operations. The information security team is responsible for securing mobile apps and traditional websites for the company's portfolio of 13 brands.\n\nThe security team became concerned when the customer service department reported a growing number of complaints. Some customers were unable to access accounts. Others received email messages indicating someone was attempting to set up accounts in their names. \n\nAccording to Dorian Skeete, boohoo Group's head of information security, the calls prompted an investigation that discovered malicious bots behind credential stuffing, and uncovered more than 100,000 fake accounts. The investigation and subsequent deletion of fraudulent accounts was largely a manual effort that took more than six months. \n\n\"During that time, we also had to take care of business as usual, which includes keeping the customer experience at exceptional levels even during peak trading times such as Black Friday,\" Skeete says. \"We quickly realized that it isn't sustainable to continually suffer those kinds of issues and fix them manually.\" So boohoo set out to find a more robust solution to address the current issues and to provide a foundation for a long-term, cohesive security strategy. \n\nThe company had worked with Cloudflare several years earlier after boohoo acquired Debenhams, a brick-and-mortar retailer with virtually no online presence. boohoo built the Debenhams ecommerce platform from scratch on AWS CloudFront, leveraging that platform's content delivery and security capabilities. The security team quickly realized that managing the security suite was too manual and it didn't provide an adequate level of protection against automated bot traffic. boohoo then turned to Cloudflare to provide the security layer for debenhams.com.\n\n### __Solution: Protecting mobile apps and websites with Cloudflare API Gateway and Cloudflare Bot Management__\n\nAfter a careful evaluation of possible vendors, the security team chose Cloudflare. \nSkeete was already familiar with Cloudflare due to previous consulting engagements. His former clients raved about Cloudflare's capabilities and support. \n\nWhile price point was an important factor in boohoo's decision to go with Cloudflare, the breadth of Cloudflare's core services — including DDoS mitigation, Web Application Firewall (WAF), Advanced Rate Limiting to stop requests from overloading a server, and bot management — also played an important role in sealing the deal. \n\nThe security team was particularly interested in API Gateway because today's threat actors increasingly target APIs to perform unauthorized actions and steal data. Cloudflare API Gateway provides client certificate-based identity and schema-based validation to protect both mobile apps and websites. \n\nBecause boohoo customers are more likely to shop on mobile devices than on traditional websites, the security team's first priority was rolling out Cloudflare Bot Management and Cloudflare API Gateway to the mobile environment. \"We needed to harden protection for those apps by Black Friday, which was just three months away,\" Skeete recalls. \"We met that deadline and in another three months, we had those services in place for our websites completed as well.\" \n\nboohoo runs Cloudflare Bot Management and API Gateway through Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) using Cloudflare Orange-to-Orange (O2O). This enables boohoo to connect its origin servers to the SFCC Cloudflare-based network while still protecting them. \n\n### __Delivering immediate results__\n\n\"Considering how complex our surface is — with mobile and traditional websites, 13 brands, and so many geographies — it's impressive how quickly and easily we implemented Cloudflare and how Cloudflare supported us throughout the entire effort,\" Skeete says.\n\nThe company saw immediate results. With Cloudflare in place, the usual holiday shopping season went without a glitch. After the peak season ended, the security team compared results to the previous year and found that security issues such as bot attacks and abusive traffic were down by as much as 90%. Reducing bot attacks alone saved an enormous amount of the team's time and reduced stress.\n\nThe dramatic security improvements have brought peace of mind not only to the security team but to the company as a whole. \"It reassures everyone that we're moving in the right direction,\" Skeete explains. \"It obviously means fewer headaches and fewer resources allocated to fighting off attacks. Our CTO summed it up after the holiday shopping peak, saying that 'from an IT and security perspective it was relatively quiet, and that's what we like!'\"\n\nThe security team believes that better protection against attacks also [improves performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/), which makes shopping with boohoo more enjoyable. That, in turn, has a positive impact on revenue.\n\nThe team has assessed the return on investment of the work done at Debenhams. A comparison of the cost of the AWS infrastructure before and after introducing Cloudflare showed that Cloudflare essentially paid for itself within six to seven months.\n\n### __Strengthening governance__\n\nThe security team is taking full advantage of the Cloudflare dashboard to obtain useful statistics and gain much needed information such as the number of bot attacks over any given time period.\n\nThis reporting capability supports a new two-pronged governance structure. The first prong is a cross-functional security working team made up of key stakeholders across business departments, including IT, security, legal, finance, and HR. The second prong is a steering group comprising higher level managers and executives.\n\n\"I plan to leverage both parts of the structure to inform the board of the latest trends and risks, going beyond retail in general to provide insights specifically related to boohoo,\" Skeete says. \"We didn't have a security reporting capability before. Now we can accurately report to senior management as well as keep our security team informed and accountable.\"\n\n### __Setting the stage for a comprehensive security solution__ \n\nCloudflare not only mitigates boohoo's immediate issues, but also provides a foundation for continual strengthening of the company's security posture. \"Cloudflare gave us the bot management we were looking for,\" Skeete concludes, \"plus it offers a whole suite of other services like Web Application Firewall, DDoS mitigation, and rate limiting. With its breadth of core services, Cloudflare aligns with boohoo's strategy of minimizing complexity through consolidation.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Ninetailed builds low-latency [personalization](https://ninetailed.io/blog/personalization-guide/?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=cloudflare&utm_campaign=case+study) solution on Cloudflare and gains 2-3x cost savings__\n\nNinetailed enables companies to build personalized web experiences for their customers. When a user requests a webpage, a company can access stored profile data via the Ninetailed API and use this information to customize even static, pre-cached web content.\n\nNinetailed's solution enables companies to run A/B testing and serve tailored content at the network edge. Their services are used by numerous major organizations, including Ruggable and Ace & Tate.\n\n### __Challenge: Low-latency access to customer personalization data__\n\nTo personalize websites and simplify A/B testing, Ninetailed stores profile information for each customer. One of the main challenges with implementing web personalization is minimizing latency or the time it takes for a page to reach the user after they make a request. If fetching profile data and building pages based on it introduces delays, then websites may have decreased customer conversions, resulting in lost revenue for the firm.\n\n### __Workers moves customization to the network edge__\n\nEdge computing is the logical fit for Ninetailed's mission to provide personalization with minimal latency or performance impacts.\nNinetailed has been using Cloudflare since the company was founded in 2021. According to Alexander Braunreuther, Ninetailed's Co-Founder and CTO, \"We created our very first product on Workers. Workers took in events and evaluated the property data directly on the edge, which made it possible to serve customers globally, with a very low latency personalization engine.\"\nIn addition to offering low latency and global reach, Workers also provided a cost-effective platform for building Ninetailed's services. Compared to traditional serverless platforms, Workers is more cost-efficient, leading to 2-3x cost savings.\n\nIn addition to using Workers for their own infrastructure, Ninetailed also recommends it to clients to implement edge site re-rendering. Ninetailed provides a blueprint for clients to personalize web pages on the fly using HTML Rewriter on Cloudflare Workers.\n\nBy implementing edge site re-rendering, Ninetailed clients are able to serve personalized webpages with minimal latency. First, static, cached content can be fetched from a CDN node with minimal latency. Then, the page's HTML can be personalized using the customer's profile data on Workers before being sent on to the end user.\n\n### __Durable Objects eliminates data consistency challenges__\n\nCloudflare Workers enabled Ninetailed to apply profile-based customizations with minimal latency. However, customer profile data needed to be stored somewhere where it could be quickly accessed by Workers.\n\nInitially, Ninetailed implemented data storage via a network of multiple Redis clusters distributed around the world. Data would be fetched from the nearest Redis cluster by Workers and used to customize a requested page.\n\nWhile this was a very low-latency solution, it struggled with data consistency. When new data was added to a Redis cluster, it required about 300 ms to sync to other clusters. This could present an issue if a customer had a render server and client system that connected to different Redis servers. If the render server updated the state on its local server and the client made a request too quickly, then the client would receive outdated data.\n\nSince updates arrived milliseconds later, these types of issues were difficult and time-consuming to trouble. Also, operating their own network of Redis clusters meant that Ninetailed spent significant time and effort ensuring that Redis servers were scaled appropriately and data was syncing properly between them.\n\nWith the introduction of Cloudflare's Durable Objects, which enable applications to store state data on the Cloudflare Network, Ninetailed had an alternative to their homegrown Redis cluster network. Instead of storing data at multiple, distributed locations, Durable Objects moved data stored to the network edge.\n\nBraunreuther says, \"Durable Objects is an ideal fit for Ninetailed. We can scale horizontally across Durable Objects without sending large volumes of traffic to any single one.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a user's requests come from the same location as when they first accessed Ninetailed's API. In the rare situation when a user relocates — such as going on a vacation — they remain at their new location for some time. According to Braunreuther, \"Durable Objects works very well for us because you have your data where you are, and it's transactional, so data consistency issues are eliminated.\" \n\nAfter successfully testing the solution, Ninetailed replaced their entire network of 10 Redis clusters with Durable Objects. Gabriel Dillon, Head of Partnerships at Ninetailed, says, \"Durable Objects is fundamental to the way that Ninetailed is built. But it's also kind of cool that our clients never see that at all. It just works.\"\n\n### __Workers and Durable Objects enable low-latency, edge-based personalization__\n\nNinetailed chose Cloudflare over other serverless and data storage offerings because of the unique capabilities that Cloudflare offers. According to Braunreuther, \"I couldn't find another system in the market that can offer this low of latency. Where Durable Objects really shines is linking data near the edge. I personally don't know another service that can provide that.\" Ninetailed remains on the cutting edge of the Cloudflare Network, testing new features as they come out to determine if they offer opportunities to improve the experience for Ninetailed's users and their customers.",

						"longDescription": "## __Stax uses Cloudflare Zero Trust to boost security compliance, support multi-platform development, and accelerate innovation__\n\n[Stax](https://www.stax.io/) is a Melbourne-based management platform for AWS. With decades of collective experience delivering enterprise-grade AWS solutions, the Stax team provides companies with the tools and guidance they need to simplify cloud migrations and easily manage their online infrastructure.\n\nFounded in 2015, Stax has grown to a customer base of over 200 companies across 3 continents. Their clients include fast food businesses, luxury brands, and corporations in the top 20 of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  \n\n### __Challenge: Replacing underperforming technology to increase security compliance and support multiple development environments__ \n\nSecurity is core to Stax's core platform, which helps customers manage cloud data and infrastructure. Stax follows strict industry guidelines like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and SOC2 customer data management from the American Institute of CPAs. In addition to meeting these standards, Stax has its own stringent internal security standards.     \n\n\"Our enterprise customers contractually require Stax to meet very specific compliance standards,\" says Ridgewell. \"That led us to enforce security controls like Zero Trust across our infrastructure.\" \n\nEarly on in its [Zero Trust implementation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/how-to-implement-zero-trust/), Stax experienced technical challenges and feature gaps with its prior vendor.  \n\n\"The old solution lacked support for our environment. The vast majority of our computer fleet runs MacOS, and many of our critical developers run Linux,\" says Ridgewell. \"Their limited Mac compatibility often delayed our releases, and their Linux functionality was non-existent.\" \n\nStax also had issues with the vendor's instability and regular service interruptions. Stax's developers frequently had their productivity limited by severe latency problems and delays — especially when accessing company applications and databases.\n\nFinally, Stax disliked that the solution required regular server maintenance – a task that burdened administrators and ran contrary to the company's focus on low-maintenance serverless technology.  \n\n\"Our old vendor required us to run their tunnel agent on a dedicated EC2 server,\" says Ridgewell. \"That was less than ideal for us. We didn't want a critical part of our Zero Trust network infrastructure on equipment we needed to manually patch or maintain.\"\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare Zero Trust for performant, cross-platform, serverless access to company tools__ \n\nLooking for serverless, cloud-native security that met their performance expectations and supported all their operating environments, Stax contacted Cloudflare. For four weeks, Cloudflare collaborated with the company to develop a Zero Trust implementation that made sense for Stax. \n\n\"We created proofs of concept and iterated through designs until we found the configuration that accommodated all of our admin interfaces,\" says Ridgewell. \"Cloudflare did exactly what we needed it to — it protected our endpoints and locked down our security much more effectively than the solution it replaced.\"\n\nCloudflare Zero Trust is now the linchpin for how Stax [secures application access](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/), with secure, low-latency connections to company systems and SaaS services like Slack. Cloudflare has made it easy for Stax to apply identity and device posture checks, so Stax can make progress in its Zero Trust approach.\n\nRather than building and shipping custom workstations loaded with security controls, Stax contractors can securely access specific applications on their own machines using a single sign-on (SSO). Cloudflare integrates with the Stax's identity provider (IdP) of choice and checks identity for every request before granting access to an application. \n\n[Cloudflare's integration with Crowdstrike](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2022/cloudflare-crowdstrike-expand-zero-trust-partnership/) has helped Stax layer on device health as another key Zero Trust check. Stax checks for device health based on Crowstrike's software before allowing or denying access requests. \n\n\"With Cloudflare and Crowdstrike working together, we know if a device on the network has malware,\" he says. \"We can instantly cut a connection, secure our important systems, and remediate an affected machine. The Cloudflare integration with Crowdstrike strengthens our overall security posture.\"\n\nStax has also seen an exponential improvement in the quality of employee access to internal systems. Database and administrative access latency has shrunk to less than 100 milliseconds from over 700 — an 86% change. Further improving productivity, Cloudflare also provided compatibility for development on Linux and Mac, development environments that the previous vendor's solution did not support.  \n\n\"We have seen benefits like happier developers, and simplified maintenance,\" says Ridgewell. \"Although we rarely have problems with Cloudflare, we can easily diagnose and resolve the few problems we do have by ourselves.\"    \n\nFinally, Stax solved the manual server maintenance issue that complicated their prior Zero Trust implementation by replacing the dedicated EC2 server with a serverless Cloudflare Tunnel – lightweight software that runs without costly manually maintained hardware.\n\n\"Not needing to manage or patch the server OS also aligns with our goals for a completely serverless infrastructure. That is a huge win for Stax,\" says Ridgewell. \n\n### __Adding value with Cloudflare integration partnerships__ \n\nWith the Cloudflare dashboard and built-in integration features like the [Cloudflare Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/zone-analytics-%28-deprecated%29-get-dashboard), Stax can pipe Cloudflare data directly into critical AWS management tools like Datadog to further improve their service offerings. \n\nGoing forward, Stax is interested in taking advantage of Cloudflare's integration with Terraform to automate the process of deploying security policies for its customers. \n\n\"We are looking into single-click AWS deployment models for Cloudflare and extended Zero Trust policy control via Terraform so that any Stax customer on Cloudflare can easily benefit from the work we are doing,\" says Ridgewell. \n\nFor Stax, Cloudflare support has been as significant as the functionality improvements provided by Cloudflare tools. From updates on new features and use cases to issue resolution, Cloudflare has impressed the company with its proactive service. \n\n\"A key benefit of choosing Cloudflare is how quickly issues get fixed. Even with obscure problems specific to our deployment, Cloudflare provides the right people for the right outcome,\" says Ridgewell. \"I can't speak highly enough about the partnership.\"  \n",

Docker Desktop provides Mac, Linux, and Windows environments for building and sharing containerized applications and microservices.\n\n### __Challenge: Contain rapidly rising S3 egress costs__ \n\nWhen Docker's contract for its AWS-based content delivery network (CDN) came up for renewal, the company's platform group thoroughly investigated available options as part of the contract renewal process. The research led to implementing the Cloudflare CDN to handle download requests from Docker Hub. The primary reason was Cloudflare's ability to cache content closer to users, which speeds the fulfillment of user download requests while ensuring security and reliability. \n\nAccording to Brett Inman, Senior Manager of Engineering at Docker, implementing Cloudflare was simple and straightforward. However, the company became increasingly concerned about the rapidly rising egress fees incurred when download requests required the transfer of content from Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) to Cloudflare servers.\n\n\"Essentially, the egress from S3 was costing us almost as much as we were paying Cloudflare to then serve that traffic to users,\" Inman explains. \"Our cache hit ratio was already at 97%, which is quite high and more than sufficient for many companies. But, because of our huge request volume, we needed to boost the ratio even higher to bring down the costs associated with pulling content from S3 to satisfy requests.\" \n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare Cache Reserve boosts cache hit ratios even further to lower egress costs__\n\nCloudflare CDN's tiered caching ensures that the content users request the most is stored as close as possible to them. For Docker, this means faster and more efficient downloads. When cache storage in a particular data center nears capacity, Cloudflare \"evicts\" less-popular content to make room for the content that's requested more frequently.\n\n\"Using eviction as a caching approach works well for most companies,\" Inman says. \"But when a developer requests content that has been evicted from our cache, that content has to be served from its origin in S3. Because of our massive content volume and huge number of requests, the egress costs are substantial. So when Cloudflare announced the Cache Reserve beta, we were enthusiastic about trying it.\"\n\nCache Reserve ensures that cached content that hasn't been requested for a long time remains in cache. This eliminates the need to go back to the source for that content. Cache Reserve increased Docker's cache hit ratio from 97% to more than 99%. \n\n\"The 2% cache hit ratio improvement enabled by Cache Reserve has eliminated roughly two-thirds of our S3 egress. The reduction in egress charges is almost an order of magnitude larger than the price we paid for Cache Reserve.\"\n\n### __Securing private data repositories__\n\nWhile Docker Hub is a place where people go for public content, many Docker customers also upload private application code and images, which they store in their own repositories on the Docker platform. Preventing unauthorized access to these private repositories is essential. Docker uses Cloudflare Workers to keep private content safe.\n\n\"We need exceptionally strong security for our customers who upload private app code to Docker Hub,\" Inman notes. \"Cloudflare Workers provides an authentication layer that ensures that anyone who tries to access user data is authorized to do so.\"\n\nWhen Docker first implemented Cloudflare's network, the platform group used the Cloudflare Workers serverless compute solution to create a script that acts as the authentication layer between the user and the actual download. In this way, Docker confirms that users are who they say they are. This ensures that private repositories are accessible only by authorized users. The Workers script also comes into play when Cloudflare pulls data from repositories in S3, ensuring that Cloudflare serves data from the origin server only to authorized users.\n\nAfter the platform group started using Cache Reserve, applying the Workers script to content stored in Cache Reserve was simply a matter of flipping a switch. \"It required only minimal effort on our part.\" Inman recalls. \"That simplicity and ease of use is very beneficial to us.\"\n\n### __Increasing developer productivity while saving time and money__\n\nInman appreciates the reliability of the Cloudflare global network and the ease of managing it. \"We don't have to spend a lot of engineering time getting Cloudflare capabilities to work or chasing down problems. So it's economical to manage,\" he said. \"Most of our interactions with the Cloudflare team are about how we can leverage new Cloudflare features to increase developer productivity while at the same time saving us money.\"\n\nContainer technology has revolutionized application development and Docker is the go-to platform for container developers. The company provides millions of active developers worldwide with fast, reliable downloads and airtight security for their applications and data. Docker is always looking for new ways to serve its developer community and Cloudflare will continue to play a key role in that endeavor.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Whole-of-state security — Cloudflare partners with the Arizona Department of Homeland Security to empower Cyber Readiness Program for local and community organizations statewide__\n\nThe State of Arizona has embraced the cloud as the most flexible, efficient, and cost-effective way to create an infrastructure that satisfies its population of 7.5 million citizens' demands for online services and information.  \n\nIn its quest to provide its residents with safe universal access to information, the State of Arizona also emphasizes the importance of protecting its citizens and services from online threats. In 2019, to address increasing security concerns in a climate where cyber attacks against state and local governments are becoming commonplace, the state developed the initial version of what has grown into the Arizona Statewide Cyber Readiness Program (CRP).  What began as a federally-funded cybersecurity grant program has been designed to be the  backbone for a whole-of-state approach to cyber defenses, where an attack against one entity is viewed as an attack against all entities.\n\n## __Challenge: Providing simple but effective online security for public entities with limited resources__ \n\n\"Our IT priority is modernizing legacy technologies and securely delivering better digital services to our citizens\" explains J.R. Sloan, State Chief Information Officer, Arizona Department of Administration. \"By leveraging the cloud, we can move more quickly to deliver incremental services that already have security built in.\"\n\nThe Cyber Readiness Program is now in its fourth year and has grown to become a critical statewide initiative, providing five cybersecurity tools that are protecting more than 210 entities, including 124 K-12 school districts, 59 cities, all 15 counties and 13 entities that represent other local services like libraries, fire districts, county associations, and tribal partners. \n\n\"Cyber attacks against school systems have historically shut down school operations, especially now that schools have become increasingly dependent on the use of technology following the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Ryan Murray, Deputy Director of the Arizona Department of Homeland Security, and Interim State Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). \"As more technological tools and programs are introduced to classroom environments, more cybersecurity efforts are required in order to mitigate these new threats and vulnerabilities.\"\n\nMany state organizations benefiting from the Cyber Readiness Program don't have dedicated full-time cyber-security professionals or even IT staff, which makes it even more important to help secure these entities with protections they wouldn't otherwise have.\n\n### __Solution: Joining forces to supply Cloudflare security solutions for government agencies__\n\nCloudflare security solutions, is one of five tools available through the CRP and currently secures more than 80 domains statewide. In addition to security, the CRP provides on-demand administrative support and IT management services for departments in need.   \n\n\"Arizona has been a Cloudflare customer since we started using it in 2017 to protect what is now our Drupal website infrastructure,\" says Murray. \"We really needed something that was not an on-premise application firewall and we've had remarkable success with advanced Cloudflare features, especially the bot management and advanced firewall rules our on-premise security solutions didn't support.\" \n\n### __Complete layer-seven protection with the Cloudflare WAF, Bot Management, Rate Limiting, and content delivery__\n\nMaricopa County, the state's largest county is home to 3.75 million citizens, is another advocate of Cloudflare cybersecurity solutions. The county began its Cloudflare journey in 2020 with Project Athenian, the free Cloudflare service to secure its election websites and protect voters' confidential data. \n\nToday, the county is the state's largest user of Cloudflare application security services under the CRP. Cloudflare protects everything from Maricopa County's top-level sites to its school districts and tribal communities.\n\n\"We've had only positive experiences with the Cloudflare services built into the grant program,\" says Michael Moore, Information Security Officer for the Maricopa County Recorder's Office. \"Before Cloudflare, we had firewalls in place, but we didn't have layer seven denial of service protection or anything to protect against sophisticated attacks that emulate end users. Now, we have everything — the Cloudflare WAF, bot management, rate limiting, and caching.\"\n\nMaricopa County uses Cloudflare to ensure its websites are always available and its users can easily locate important information. Using the website beballotready.vote as an example, Moore explains how, using Cloudflare custom page rules, Maricopa County redirects the memorable vanity URL to a page in the county recorder's website that most users would struggle to locate. \n\nSimilarly, using intelligent, integrated, and scalable Cloudflare services, every organization in the county can identify and thwart attacks by blocking problematic IP addresses. Cloudflare also protects the county's online forms from credential stuffing or brute force attacks without exposing users to excessive CAPTCHAs. \n\nBy caching static content on the Cloudflare global network, local and state entities can provide their constituents and communities with instantaneous information from the network edge, mitigating network bottlenecks, and traditional bandwidth limitations. Cloudflare-supported Anti-Phishing and Security Awareness Training empowers employees to recognize and avoid socially engineered online threats.\n\n### __Making security simple with easily deployed cloud-native solutions and Cloudflare support__ \n\n\"The biggest impact of the Cyber Readiness Program is providing high-quality solutions at no charge to our organization and others like Maricopa County,\" says Moore. \"But, even if we didn't have the program, we would still use Cloudflare.\"\n\nIn addition to the cost savings for security grant recipients, the ease of implementing Cloudflare tools has been central to the initiative's wide acceptance. \n\n\"With the Cloudflare platform, we're getting very high-powered, very technical cybersecurity detection and protections that take little to no effort to deploy,\" says Murray. \"That's especially poignant when we're talking about vulnerable organizations that already struggle with resources, let alone managing another complicated tool.\"\n\nCloudflare support has also been crucial to the program. Since day one, Cloudflare support and training have led to a transfer of skills that have empowered smaller entities to independently manage their own security infrastructure. \n\n\"Cloudflare has been a great partner, training us and improving our skills to enable us to solve problems autonomously as we go,\" says Sloan.\n\n\"Cloudflare's customer and technical support representatives have been very helpful and quick to respond.  We have established an excellent relationship with talented people who have stood by the state since the beginning,\" adds Murray.\n\nThe final factor in the collaboration's success is the way the partnership has evolved beyond the protections Cloudflare provides; which is based on the company's conviction that cybersecurity should be universally accessible. \n\n\"Because Cloudflare shares our belief that we're all in this together — government or business, large or small — they are a critical partner in everything we want to achieve,\" says Murray. \n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare helps Bouvet protect their online infrastructure and give employees secure work-from-home access to company resources",
						"longDescription": "## __Scandinavian IT and digital communications experts Bouvet ensure secure, uninterrupted client service with Cloudflare Zero Trust and cloud email security__\n\n[Bouvet](https://www.bouvet.no/) is an IT and digital communications consultancy in Northern Europe widely recognized for their focus on innovation, sustainability, and strong sense of social responsibility. Since 2006, the company has supported a variety of private and public sector companies' digital transformations through software development, system integration, business intelligence, data analytics, cloud computing, and cybersecurity service expertise.\n\n### __Challenge: Rapidly securing remote work access for employees across Europe and protecting sensitive resources from email-based threats__\n\nPrior to 2020, Bouvet's employees worked across 17 offices in Norway and Sweden, but during the COVID-19 pandemic their staff began working remotely around the world. As the company's slow and unreliable VPN struggled to handle the increased traffic and hurt productivity, securing access to corporate resources emerged as an IT priority.\n\n\"Overnight, we realized the bandwidth of our costly VPN concentrator was terrible. In some parts of Europe, our employees were seeing speeds of half a megabit,\" says Persson, \"In the mornings we would discover that another 10 people couldn't work due to connectivity issues.\"\n\nThe Ukraine invasion presented the company with yet another challenge. In response to the conflict, the company sought to make its already stringent security standards even more proactive.\n\n\"When the war in Ukraine started, we received many emails from customers and from authorities stating that Bouvet is a critical vendor and that we had to take every possible precaution to remain secure,\" says Persson. \"We have many security-sensitive customers and our top priority is keeping them safe in this new threat landscape.\"\n\nIn addition to these greater external events, Bouvet's most consistent threat vectors are email and web browsing.\n\n\"We saw a lot of phishing emails coming through our mail filters. It was just a matter of time before somebody actually gave away their credentials,\" says Persson. \"Phishing was our primary concern, but we wanted protection from everything on the web from ransom and malware to automatic download drive-by attacks.\"\n\nBouvet needed a solution that would address its collective security and productivity challenges — preferably from a single vendor.\n\n### __Solution: Protecting the company infrastructure with secure and easy-to-implement Cloudflare Zero Trust Services__\n\nShortly after the shift to remote work, Persson turned to Cloudflare to secure employee access to Bouvet resources. His initial confidence in Cloudflare was grounded in his own experiences securing his home IT environment with Cloudflare Access, a [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/).\n\n\"I knew from personal experience Cloudflare Zero Trust services could protect Bouvet's applications, and getting management approval to go with Cloudflare Access was simple,\" he says. \"Cloudflare's policy of complete transparency when it comes to security matched our own. That made it easy to build trust.\"\n\nBouvet's initial Cloudflare pilot focused on securing remote access for dozens of consultants, whose movement was limited by COVID-19 travel restrictions. Encouraged by the pilot's results, the company began rolling out Cloudflare Access to nearly 2,500 employees over the following year. Through these phases, Bouvet's administrators found Cloudflare simple to set up and easy to maintain.\n\n\"We had Cloudflare Zero Trust up and running in no time. Using our old VPN, it took us days to provision new users in a secure manner where people could only access what they explicitly needed to access. As the VPN was set up in a traditional default-allow configuration, users would have more access than needed for their day-to-day work. Now we can onboard them in minutes,\" says Persson, \"It was really messy. Even with only 200 users on the VPN, we received multiple daily support tickets about the client crashing. When our VPN licenses expire, we won't be renewing them.\"\n\nSwitching to Cloudflare has helped improve efficiency not only for administrators but also for end users, who benefit from a more streamlined authentication experience and a more reliable connection. Plus, Bouvet has been able to improve its security posture by adopting identity-based, default-deny Zero Trust policies.\n\n### __A single-vendor solution to consolidate security__\n\nBased on their positive experience switching from its VPN to a cloud-delivered ZTNA service, Bouvet began to explore opportunities to deprecate other legacy IT and security systems and consolidate security onto Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform.\n\nFor this next phase, Bouvet focused on modernizing their threat defense to support its current hybrid work model and reduce reliance on their on-prem security stack. Specifically, Bouvet onboarded Cloudflare's [Secure Web Gateway](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/) (SWG) to filter and inspect Internet traffic across remote users and office locations. Reducing the risk from online threats like ransomware has been critical, particularly as cyber-attacks increase across Europe due to the Ukraine conflict.\n\n\"My team and I sleep better at night without worrying whether we have the latest security patches or our third-party and legacy tech stacks are secure,\" says Persson. We depend on Cloudflare to reduce our attack surface by securing our ports, filtering threats, and cleaning up our traffic. That is important when our users may be under attack or entering sensitive information as they submit support or feature requests.\"\n\n\"We also use Cloudflare Gateway's DNS resolver for our premises' firewalls, where egress traffic is filtered for every client in the office/s, meaning we keep our employees, guests and customer equipment safe from online threats. And it's all clientless.\"\n\nNext, Bouvet bolstered their [protections](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) against Internet threats even further by layering on Cloudflare's [Remote Browser Isolation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-browser-isolation/) (RBI) service. RBI reduces risk by running all browser code on Cloudflare's global network – keeping any malware far away from local devices and insulating users from harm. Within isolated browsers, administrators can also control how users interact with data on websites, including preventing risky actions like downloads, uploads, copy-pastes, keyboard inputs, and more.\n\n\"People use their computers for everything, not just work, but with Cloudflare RBI we can seamlessly isolate malicious domains and stop users from entering their credentials into shady sites and harvesters,\" says Persson. \"By the time a user reports a security incident, Cloudflare has already isolated the threat. It's a huge benefit. \"\n\nBouvet has also taken a more proactive stance against phishing by adopting Cloudflare's [cloud email security service](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/email-security-services/), which preemptively hunts for and blocks email phishing infrastructure, sources, and delivery mechanisms from the cloud. During Bouvet's initial testing, Cloudflare proved itself extremely effective at identifying sophisticated threat emails. The results solidified Cloudflare's position as Bouvet's first line of [defense](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email-security/) against phishing and other socially engineered email-based threats.\n\n\"Over 30 days and 265,000 messages, Cloudflare detected 908 malicious emails that our existing email security tools missed,\" says Persson. \"Cloudflare email security protects us from potential data exfiltration and domain-wide ransom attacks. We no longer see email-related support tickets in our security reporting portal.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Premium Success — An invaluable tool__\n\nWhile Cloudflare integrated Zero Trust services and Layer 7 security tools like the Web Application Firewall (WAF), Global Network, DDoS Protection, and Bot Management provide security and peace of mind that allow the company to focus on delivering innovative IT solutions, Cloudflare Premium Success support has also been invaluable to Bouvet.\n\n\"The Cloudflare Customer Success team is beyond competent. They know you as a customer. They understand your needs and environment, and they don't try to sell you products you don't need,\" says Persson. \"They don't run you through a checklist asking if you have rebooted your PC. They gather information the engineers need to solve your problems quickly — even when the problem is new and unfamiliar.\"\n\nBouvet is also a Cloudflare reseller and Authorized Service Delivery Partner — the first in the Nordics. \n\n\"Transparency is the foundation for building trust — Cloudflare is so transparent with every single incident, it was easy to form a partnership,\" he says. \"It has been an excellent collaboration. We will continue to expand our use of Cloudflare services and solutions.\"",

						"longDescription": "## __Fashion retailer Pacsun uses Cloudflare to prevent website outages and deter bots during viral sales events__\n\nPacsun is a leading specialty retailer offering a cross section of emerging brands and trending fashion through the lens of youth culture. Throughout the contemporary, streetwear and active lifestyle markets, Pacsun partners with the best brands to offer curated collections, rare and exclusive products, and creative collaborations on every level. Founded in 1980, Newport, CA. Curated in Los Angeles.\n\n### __Challenge: Maintaining customer confidence by protecting ecommerce sales against automated bot attacks__\n\nPacsun's successes with hype retail and Gen Z fashion left the company with a unique but very serious dilemma. Due to their viral drop marketing strategy — limited edition online releases of high-demand merchandise — Pacsun's online sales events were as irresistible to automated bots and online profiteers as they were to genuine customers. Frequent attacks on their website and inventory during their drops left IT and security teams struggling to keep the site online.\n\n\"Every time we had a hype sale, we set up a war room,\" explains Sarwat Siddiqi, Pacsun's Senior Cyber Security Engineer. \"Six to eight times a year, before each drop, we would wait with our security vendor on call, afraid our site would soon stop responding due to malicious traffic. Sometimes it would go down in the first 10 minutes of a sale.\"\n\nThe instability was eroding consumer confidence in the Pacsun brand and their events. In addition to incapacitating their servers, inventory hoarding bots caused problems by locking stock items and making them unavailable for purchase. Bot-driven purchases of limited-quantity items for resale also left stocks severely depleted once the site was back online. Unable either to buy products or access the site, frustrated shoppers abandoned their carts, resulting in millions of dollars of lost revenue.\n\nThe company's previous security and CDN vendor, a long-established industry presence and early entrant into the content delivery space, was powerless to address it at scale — even with specialized third-party assistance.\n\n\"It became obvious our primary CDN security provider didn't have adequate tools to deal with the high levels and sophistication of distributed bot activity,\" says Scott Forrest, Pacsun's Chief Information Security Officer. \"Even if they could catch 80% of the problem traffic, we still had to deal with the most dangerous 20% percent manually. We needed to get it under control.\"\n\n### __Solution: Automating web security and enhancing site performance right off the bat with Cloudflare__\n\nBased on recommendations from their payment services partner and other vendors, Pacsun opted to migrate off their legacy CDN and security provider and move onto Cloudflare.\n\n\"We saw the obvious benefits of moving over,\" says Forrest. \"When a specialized third-party bot management vendor told us they preferred to run their services on Cloudflare Workers, it became clear how far ahead of the curve Cloudflare was.\"\n\nAfter translating the custom rules from their existing solution, Pacsun began the migration to Cloudflare. They moved more than 95% of their traffic to the Cloudflare Global Network, switching on the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), Secure DNS, and DDoS protection. From day one, Cloudflare performed flawlessly.\n\n\"Switching to Cloudflare, our system was 27% faster overnight,\" says Forrest. \"It improved our [performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) right off the bat — cache rates jumped immediately and things just started flowing.\"\n\n\"That was when we knew we made the right call,\" adds Siddiqi. \"The cutover to Cloudflare was so smooth. The UI was much simpler too — using Cloudflare rather than our legacy tool, I no longer felt like I was working in an early 2000s data center.\"\n\nSince the implementation, Pacsun has seen even greater user experience gains by enabling Rocket Loader, the Cloudflare utility that asynchronously accelerates website rendering by prioritizing visual elements before scripts. Cloudflare DDoS protection also helped the company detect a bandwidth spike caused by a partner accidentally uploading a 4k image for their mobile pages rather than a 600-pixel version.\n\n### __Stopping bots cold with Cloudflare Bot Management__\n\nPacsun appreciates their performance improvements under Cloudflare, but bot management is where they see the greatest results.\n\n\"Before Cloudflare, bot mitigation was a painfully manual process. We had to wait for the bad traffic, investigate its causes, and figure out how to build a rule to stop it,\" says Forrest. \"Cloudflare, with machine learning technology behind it, is always on — it does the work unassisted. That comforts us.\"\n\nSiddiqi estimates that now Cloudflare stops all but 1% of attacks before they reach the website. At Pacsun's lowest point, within the first 10 minutes of a sale, 90% of all traffic on the site was bots that had snuck by their defenses.\n\n\"Since Cloudflare, I get to enjoy my breakfast instead of fighting to keep the site up. The bots still come, but it's almost a non-event,\" he says. \"I actually get to focus on the things I should focus on — monitoring our partners, working with the ERP staff to check for duplicate or fraudulent email addresses, and general tasks that make the site run better.\"\n\n\"Now,\" adds Forrest, \"Instead of going to the office at 5:30 am to prepare the war room, we schedule a call with our partners 30 minutes before the sale starts. We cut the call short once we realize nothing bad is going to happen. Even though new security challenges always pop up, we haven't had an 'Oh my god, we're on fire!' moment since we have been with Cloudflare.\"\n\nAlong their journey, the Pacsun security team has formed strong relationships within Cloudflare, building trust and relying on their Cloudflare Customer Success team to keep them informed of new features and help them achieve their goals. Cloudflare has supported their implementation, monitored key sales events, and helped streamline communications with their payment partners.\n\n\"Cloudflare have been absolute champions at preventing potential problems, increasing our efficiency, and making our journey over the last year highly successful on every front,\" says Forrest. \"There isn't anything we wanted to accomplish since we made the switch that we haven't managed.\"\n",

These insights allow Cloudflare to create proprietary WAF rulesets that account for 84.6% of application-layer threats blocked by Cloudflare, resulting in major security gains over the standard OWASP firewall Core Rule Set. And Flo can also deploy its own fine-grained, custom rules to suit its needs. \n\nFlo Health also took advantage of [Cloudflare's integration with CrowdStrike](https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/crowdstrike/endpoint-partners/) to ensure that its employees had secure access to applications from anywhere. Using both product sets, Flo could easily deploy custom rules based on Crowdstrike's ZTA score to ensure only employees with the right device posture got access to sensitive applications. Employees with low ZTA score were either denied access or put in a sandbox enviornment.\n\nIn addition to Cloudflare's security suite, Flo is leveraging Cloudflare to reach a premium subscriber audience with exclusive video content served by Cloudflare Stream. Stream gives Flo a way to manage and deliver video at scale with full control, including a Flo-branded video player. This experience has proven so compelling that Flo's fans are watching 10 times more video than they were with their previous provider, totaling over 14.5 million minutes watched per month. \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Cloudflare has helped us ensure app reliability and 30% faster response time across all regions.

						"shortDescription": "Drata, a continuous security and compliance automation platform, chose Cloudflare Zero Trust and application services to secure its infrastructure and thwart persistent online attacks",
						"longDescription": "## __Security without sacrifice — Safeguarding Drata's compliance automation platform with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nIn mid-2020, Drata's co-founders set out to help companies of all sizes achieve and maintain compliance by creating a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that champions an automation-led approach to streamline risk and compliance. In two years, the company has quickly become the security and compliance automation platform of choice for thousands of companies across the world, with over 14 compliance frameworks, standards, and regulations (including SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, among others), a dynamic Trust Center, comprehensive Risk Management offering, as well as its Open API, empowering customers with the ability to architect creative solutions specific to their risk and compliance needs. \n\n### __Challenge: Securing a security and compliance platform__ \n\nGiven their focus on compliance, the Drata co-founders were hyper-security conscious from the start. \n\n\"We were entering the cyber security industry, so we understood from day one that security had to be the core of Drata's foundations. It was the one place we could never bend or compromise,\" says Daniel Marashlian, Drata Co-Founder and CTO. \n\nDrata needed to secure its employees, resources, and infrastructure. But, while they required stringent security, the Drata co-founders also needed a system that did not overburden administrators or feel intrusive to their end users. \n\n\"We wanted to lock everything down, but we didn't want to make it hard for our people to actually work,\" says Marashlian. \"We needed the best tools and security methodologies without going overboard and becoming obstructive.\" \n\nDrata faced another challenge — the company's growing profile attracted attention from attackers.\n\n\"Simply being in the cyber security industry, we are a target,\" says Marashlian. \"As we grew, we saw an increasing number of bot attacks on our marketing pages. We had to strike a balance that blocked the bots without disrupting potential customers.\" \n\nThe company also needed to secure and manage their online [Trust Center](https://drata.com/product/trust-center) — a dynamic and customizable page integrated into their website that proactively displays critical elements of their security posture for customers, auditors, administrators, and prospects looking for greater transparency into a company's security and compliance program. \n\n\"With the Drata Trust Center, every customer can easily spotlight the quality of their security programs, but as we grow, democratizing that information for each company over HTTPS means maintaining thousands of SSL certificates,\" says Marashlian.            \n\n### __Solution: A familiar partnership and a fresh start with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nEven when Drata was still a proof-of-concept, Marashlian and his co-founders knew they wanted Cloudflare to secure their future workforce. They based this decision on prior positive experiences with Cloudflare. \n\n\"I have always been a Cloudflare proponent, so procuring Cloudflare services was one of our first line items,\" says Marashlian. \n\nToday, Drata uses Cloudflare Zero Trust to [secure access to internal applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) for nearly 400 employees spread across the globe. Cloudflare secures connections from users and devices to the applications, environments, and infrastructure crucial to the development of their core compliance platform. \n\n\"When we started our enterprise plan with Cloudflare, we did an internal security audit and knew we did not want any exposed ports or open machines because that is where attacks happen,\" says Marashlian. \"When a team member anywhere wants to use our internal tools or systems, they can only get to them using Cloudflare Zero Trust.\"  \n\nCloudflare's native integration with Okta, Drata's identity provider, made it simple to strengthen security with identity-based Zero Trust policies across applications. This integration equips IT and security administrators with granular control over who can access what. In addition, Drata has layered on additional verification steps like [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/). \n\n\"Cloudflare Zero Trust has removed our back doors and other vulnerabilities and provides us with the proper tools in a proper trust chain, enabling us to secure our information using biometrics and multi-factor identification,\" says Marashlian.\n\nCloudflare Zero Trust also saves Drata a significant amount of time and resources. It has substantially reduced administrative overhead for configuring and distributing specialized equipment when onboarding employees and contractors. \n\n\"Before Cloudflare, we had very specific workstation requirements for anyone that needed to use our internal tools,\" says Marashlian. \"A year ago we would have had to ship specially configured laptops to new staff or contractors. With Zero Trust in place, we can just point them towards a software download and give them login information.\" \n\n### __Blocking automated credential stuffers and false bookings with Cloudflare Bot Management__ \n\nAs a new company, Drata secured its sites and infrastructure using the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Layer 7 protection. As the company grew, however, it attracted malicious traffic that resulted in inflated data sets and false conversion information that made life difficult for Drata's marketing team.\n\n\"When we saw our traffic and bandwidth usage increasing due to false form submissions, fake demo requests, and automated input data, we stopped it at the edge — we blocked the IP addresses using the Cloudflare WAF,\" says Marashlian. \"But, the bots kept coming back, and they were a little more sophisticated each time around.\"\n\nConsulting with their Cloudflare account team, Drata decided to implement Bot Management, which uses behavioral analysis, machine learning, and fingerprinting to differentiate between good and bad bots and stop unwanted on-page activity.\n\n\"Bot Management was simple to install and get running — after a month we had everything fine-tuned,\" says Marashlian. \"It was the right decision.\"\n\nWith its bot management dialed in and automated, Drata reduced its bandwidth consumption and improved the quality of data its marketing teams have to work with. Having Cloudflare at work in the background helps also lighten the load for Drata's technical staff. \n\n\"Knowing that attacks will never stop and that Drata will continue to grow as a target, it is good to have Cloudflare Bot Management to alert us if something goes wrong,\" says Marashlian. \"It allows our security team to focus on other issues.\"         \n\n### __Simplifying Customer Trust Center management with SSL for SaaS__\n\nTrust Center is a core offering for Drata, providing transparency in the form of compliance status with various frameworks, standards, and regulations, security reports, policy documentation, an inventory of continuous monitoring processes, and a list of authorized data sub-processors. With each Trust Center dynamically hosted on a client domain and requiring its own SSL certificate, maintaining them for a rapidly growing customer base became a logistical challenge. \n\nUsing SSL for SaaS — the Cloudflare product which automates SSL lifecycle management and reduces SSL certificate deployment times and overheads — the Drata engineers created a solution that allows their customer service team to administer Trust Center pages without direct access to the Cloudflare Enterprise dashboard.\n\n\"We created a tool that interfaces with the Cloudflare SSL for SaaS API and allows our people to provision and maintain SSL certificates with a few mouse clicks,\" says Marashlian. \"It's flexible, secure, works flawlessly, and only takes our people minutes per customer.\"\n\nIn addition to Cloudflare's rich, integrated security and the strength of its Zero Trust toolset, customer service made it the obvious choice for the Drata co-founders. As Drata matures, Cloudflare customer service and support continue to exceed their expectations.\n\n\"Whenever anything comes up, the Cloudflare team is on it immediately to help us determine a solution — the response is always positive,\" says Marashlian. \"Cloudflare is the ideal security partner for a cyber security company on the compliance vertical — it provides excellent support and works like a charm allowing us to always put our best foot forward.\"   \n",

						"shortDescription": "Cybernews uses Cloudflare to protect sensitive data, handle spikes in readership, fend off malicious bots, and implement zero trust security for collaboration with freelancers",
						"longDescription": "## __Cybernews implements defense in depth and ensures a positive reader experience for viral cyber security stories with Cloudflare__\n\n[Cybernews](https://cybernews.com/) reports on a variety of stories in the cyber security space. In an attempt to make the internet a safer space for everyone, its newsroom, spanning two continents, three time zones and four different cities, breaks news on latest breaches, hacks, vulnerabilities, and threats, among other things, offering readers worldwide a carefully curated, fact-checked articles, in-depth analysis of current threats and comments from industry leaders.\n\nWhile Cybernews is headquartered in Lithuania, it has employees and readers from around the world. The news outlet's stories get approximately 150,000 readers each day, but this number can skyrocket into the millions after a news story goes viral.\n\n### __Challenge: Protecting against data breaches and automated attacks__\n\nCyber security is a core part of Cybernews' business. Its research team track the latest breach stories and perform fact-checking and in-depth investigations into reports of breaches and vulnerabilities.\n\nThis keen security focus means that Cybernews has a clear understanding of cyber security best practices and what can go wrong if they aren't followed. It also means that Cybernews has a great deal of sensitive data — including interview content and research and investigation data — that it needs to protect.\n\nCybernews' business also makes it a prime target for cyber criminals. Attack groups who do not appreciate how they are portrayed in news reporting may target the organization with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and other attacks in revenge.\n\n### __Multi-layer defenses against data breaches__\n\nCybernews has prioritized cybersecurity since day one. Shortly after the news outlet opened three years ago, it began working with Cloudflare. According to Bronislovas Skridaila, Cybernews' CTO, \"Cybernews is all about security. Cloudflare helps to ensure that our systems and sensitive data are properly protected.\"\n\nCybernews has deployed Cloudflare solutions as part of a defense-in-depth strategy. All traffic to Cybernews systems must pass through the Cloudflare network first, which detects and filters malicious traffic before it reaches the company's network and internal firewalls. According to Skridaila, \"Many data breaches and leaks are caused by human error. By implementing holistic security approach utilising on our systems and Cloudflare's, we know that if something fails on our part, we won't be responsible for breaching sensitive data.\"\n\nSkridaila points to Cloudflare's security-focused mindset and deep experience in the space as the reason why Cybernews relies on Cloudflare to protect its systems. He says, \"Cloudflare has firewall rules, machine learning, and protection against web application attacks at a global scale. It would be stupid not to use that and try to blindly invent something like that from scratch.\"\n\n### __Bot management blocks automated attacks and content scraping__\n\nAutomated attacks pose a significant risk to Cybernews' business. Cyber criminals use bots to perform DDoS attacks and other automated attacks against the company's systems. Other organizations masquerade as Googlebot and Bingbot to scrape stories from its sites for republication elsewhere.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management provides Cybernews with the visibility and protection it needs to manage these automated threats. According to Skridaila, \"Cloudflare Bot Management helps us to filter out the noise and get a clearer view of what's really happening. Cloudflare helps us to differentiate between legitimate bots and ones that pose a threat to our content and sites.\"\n\n### __Optimizing network performance and reliability__\n\nCybernews uses a range of Cloudflare solutions to improve the performance and availability of its content. Caching is only the first step in this process. By caching 80-90% of its content on Cloudflare, Cybernews decreases network latency for readers around the world. Skridaila says, \"We cache as much as we can on Cloudflare. It reduces latency for our readers and enables us to scale when a story goes viral.\"\n\nThis design also helps Cybernews to manage the surges in demand generated by major news stories. Some releases can cause a 10x increase in traffic as referrals from other sites increase traffic to as high as 3 million visitors per day. By caching most of its content, Cybernews can meet demand and reduce the infrastructure costs of hosting its own servers.\n\nCybernews also leverages Cloudflare Pages and Workers to host applications and functions across Cloudflare's global network, decreasing its operational overhead and improving the user experience. Previously, the organization hosted internal tools and sub-projects on its own servers using containers from another vendor. With Pages, Cybernews can push the code and run everything hosted on Cloudflare, eliminating the need for additional servers.\n\nCybernews is also a power user of Cloudflare Workers, hosting a number of scripts on the Cloudflare Network. With Workers, the company can run various scripts in response to inbound traffic at the network edge, further reducing latency and hosting costs.\n\n### __Zero Trust enables secure collaboration__\n\nWith Cybernews' tight operation, the outlet is still able to perform in-depth investigations and publish a variety of content, including stories and about a dozen videos, each day.\n\nCollaboration with third-party writers and editors is what makes this possible. However, allowing contractors and freelancers access to the organization's systems could create a significant risk of data breaches, supply chain attacks, and third party incidents.\n\nCybernews uses the Cloudflare Zero Trust Platform to collaborate securely with its third-party contributors. By providing these writers limited access to company systems, the organization enables them to submit pieces and work with editors without placing the rest of the organization at risk.\n\n### __An endless learning experience__\n\nCybernews works to extract maximum benefit from the Cloudflare platform, optimizing security settings and moving self-hosted data and programs to the Cloudflare Network. According to Skridaila, the Cloudflare support team went above and beyond when answering questions. He says, \"The team not only answers your questions but also points to where the answer is on the Cloudflare website or documentation, allowing you to gain additional information and context.\" This enhanced support has been crucial to Cybernews' ability to find innovative and valuable ways of taking advantage of Cloudflare services.",

						"longDescription": "## __Genuine Parts Company teams up with Cloudflare to create a cohesive security posture across its global ecommerce footprint of 900+ sites__\n\nSince its inception in 1928, Genuine Parts Company has sold a wide variety of  automotive replacement parts, industrial parts, and related supplies to a diverse customer base of individuals and businesses.The company's high-profile brands include NAPA AUTO PARTS, Traction Heavy Duty Parts, Motion NA, and Motion Asia Pacific.\n\nA Fortune 200 company, Genuine Parts Company employs more than 53,000 people worldwide and markets its products both online and through brick-and-mortar stores. Online sales are an increasingly important channel, and the company operates more than 900 [ecommerce websites](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/). \n\n### __Challenge: Gain better visibility into the attack surface__\n\nAccording to Damian Apone, global director of governance, risk, compliance, and security at Genuine Parts Company, the company's primary security challenges revolved around effective attack surface management. The team couldn't tell how many bot attacks and DDoS attacks were occurring globally. In addition, there was no visibility into how many attacks were prevented. \n\nThe company had a web application security service, but it did not deliver the level of insight Genuine Parts Company needed. In addition, the security service ran in multiple regionally siloed instances, making it difficult to manage centrally. \n\n\"We were paying a lot of money, but we had no visibility into our global digital footprint,\" Apone explains. \"We didn't have any information on how or when we were being attacked and we had no idea who was targeting us.\"\n\n### __The solution: Cloudflare delivers robust security with broad, deep visibility__\n\nThe security team opted to move to Cloudflare not only because of its exceptional protection for websites and applications, but also because Cloudflare provides a comprehensive view of attacks. With Cloudflare's Bot Management, DDoS mitigation, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Rate Limiting, the security team now has the visibility they need to achieve robust surface attack management. \n\nCloudflare's Security Center console depicts Genuine Parts Company's attack surface visually to help the team understand attack types, associated vulnerabilities, and risk levels. This visibility enables team members to quickly see which attacks represent a serious threat so they can marshal their defensive resources in the most effective and efficient manner. \n\nToday, Cloudflare protects 900+ Genuine Parts Company websites around the world. \n\n\"Our busiest website gets approximately 2.5 billion requests a month,\" Apone explains. \"It's hit by approximately 57 million threats each and every month. And Cloudflare blocks all 57 million every month. I know this because Cloudflare's security insights technology shows me exactly what's happening across the entire digital footprint.\"\n\nApone adds that senior leaders constantly scrutinize expenditures and want proof that the company gets adequate return on every investment. Cloudflare delivers value by providing details on the volume and type of attacks it defends against. \n\n\"It's exceptionally powerful to walk into the boardroom and say, 'these are the attacks we're experiencing, here's where they are coming from, and this is how we're blocking them,'\" Apone says. \"It resonates across the business when we say Cloudflare thwarted 450 million threats in one year. Each and every one of them could have had serious financial repercussions. When board members see the numbers, they know we're getting a solid return on our Cloudflare investment.\"\n\n### __Security insights in action__\n\nThe Cloudflare Security Center is the source for data on each attack along with insight into the business impact. For example, using the security insights technology, the security team identified the top five IP addresses hitting the company's most heavily trafficked ecommerce website. Investigation showed that the second most active IP address transacting on the site was a competitor. And that competitor was engaging in extensive screen scraping of the online catalog and accessing private company information.\n\n\"If we didn't have Cloudflare, we wouldn't have known this was happening and the behavior would have continued,\" Apone recalls. \"Malicious activity like this could affect company revenue. So Cloudflare allows us to not only protect the security of our websites, but also take steps to prevent this competitor from obtaining any additional private company information. It's not just security, it's also resiliency from a revenue perspective.\"\n\n### __Alignment with strategic policies__\n\nVendor consolidation is an important aspect of Genuine Parts Company's security strategy. Working with a patchwork of different providers makes it difficult to maintain a coordinated and collaborative security posture across areas of the business. So the security team focuses on partnering with providers that deliver services across a range of security requirements. Apone maintains that reducing the number of providers  enables the security team to orchestrate efforts from a single place, which increases efficiency and productivity. \n\nCloudflare's ability to handle a broad range of threats and provide broad and deep visibility into all of them aligns with Genuine Parts Company's strategic goals for vendor consolidation.\n\n### __Advantages of a true partnership__\n\nApone notes that the most beneficial aspect of switching to Cloudflare is the partnership that has developed. \"I don't need services, I don't need software, I need help solving problems,\" he says. \"Cloudflare embraces and approaches everything through the lens of what's best for the customer, always putting the customer first.\" \n\nThat customer-first attitude has made Cloudflare a trusted partner for Genuine Parts Company. \"Cloudflare is truly interested in solving our problems. The Cloudflare team has been at our side from the beginning. Regardless of the time of day or night, they've rolled up their sleeves and helped us overcome every issue we've experienced. That's where Cloudflare excels.\"\n",

And that competitor was engaging in extensive screen scraping of the online catalog and accessing private company information.\n\n\"If we didn't have Cloudflare, we wouldn't have known this was happening and the behavior would have continued,\" Apone recalls. \"Malicious activity like this could affect company revenue. So Cloudflare allows us to not only protect the security of our websites, but also take steps to prevent this competitor from obtaining any additional private company information. It's not just security, it's also resiliency from a revenue perspective.\"\n\n### __Alignment with strategic policies__\n\nVendor consolidation is an important aspect of Genuine Parts Company's security strategy. Working with a patchwork of different providers makes it difficult to maintain a coordinated and collaborative security posture across areas of the business. So the security team focuses on partnering with providers that deliver services across a range of security requirements. Apone maintains that reducing the number of providers  enables the security team to orchestrate efforts from a single place, which increases efficiency and productivity. \n\nCloudflare's ability to handle a broad range of threats and provide broad and deep visibility into all of them aligns with Genuine Parts Company's strategic goals for vendor consolidation.\n\n### __Advantages of a true partnership__\n\nApone notes that the most beneficial aspect of switching to Cloudflare is the partnership that has developed. \"I don't need services, I don't need software, I need help solving problems,\" he says. \"Cloudflare embraces and approaches everything through the lens of what's best for the customer, always putting the customer first.\" \n\nThat customer-first attitude has made Cloudflare a trusted partner for Genuine Parts Company. \"Cloudflare is truly interested in solving our problems. The Cloudflare team has been at our side from the beginning. Regardless of the time of day or night, they've rolled up their sleeves and helped us overcome every issue we've experienced. That's where Cloudflare excels.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Luana Savings Bank experiences zero malware infections with 100% uptime with Cloudflare__\n\nSince its founding 1908, Luana Savings Bank has evolved from its origins as an agricultural lender into one of Iowa's ten largest banks. With around $2 billion assets under management, the family-owned Luana employs over 100 employees across six branches in Iowa and has been recognized as one of the most efficient banks nationally.\n\n\"Efficiency is everything at Luana. Most banks our size employ two to three hundred people — that is around 2-3 times our size,\" explains Grant Langhus, Luana's Manager of Information Technology.\n\n### __Challenge: Persistent malware infections__\n\nWith only a team of two (himself included), Grant Langhus, Manager of Information Technology, must emphasize efficiency to secure Luana and navigate the strict regulations of the financial services industry. Luana has maintained a traditional on-premise approach to IT and security focused on virtualization and network segmentation.\n\n\"As a bank, we are obviously very security-conscious and attempt to keep as much data on-premise as we can\" says Langhus. \"We host our core business applications and software locally using secure virtualization software.\"\n\nStill, when Langhus first joined in 2011, Luana was consistently vulnerable to Internet-borne malware, and Langhus recalls the intrusion detection system \"lighting up like a Christmas tree across the board.\" Every month, his team was rebuilding and conducting forensics investigations on at least one infected desktop machine or server. These malware infections not only posed critical security risks, but also money and significant repair effort hindered business efficiency.\n\n\"We couldn't just disconnect our machines from the Internet, and when our malware identification and prevention systems lit up, it was already too late.\" says Langhus. \"We needed a proactive rather than a reactive solution if we didn't want to make the news.\" \n\n### __Temporary fix: Adopting on-premise Remote Browser Isolation__\n\nTo mitigate these malware infections, Luana began using an on-premise remote browser isolation (RBI) service. This meant that when employees browsed the Internet, all website code ran on remote servers, not local devices, thereby keeping threats far away from end users.\n\nIsolation has proven to be effective in [preventing threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/). In the seven years since Luana first adopted RBI, the company has not had a device infected by malware from Internet browsing. Luana has saved at least $23K per year by not needing to buy a new device or rebuild an infected one each month and saves at least 12 labor hours per month by not wasting time investigating infections. \n\nHowever, relying on an on-premise RBI service became inefficient over time. The service was prone to outages that only the vendor could address – sometimes, taking as long as a few hours – and support was unsatisfactory. In addition, the configuration and scaling to new users and use cases were complex and cumbersome.\n\n\"The prior service worked, but there was a learning curve. It was not intuitive, and it took serious effort to create new instances as we needed them,\" says Langhus. \"Even then, uptime was only around 96%, which was not ideal. As our provider grew, it took them longer and longer to respond — nobody could work while we waited for the issue to be resolved.\"\n\n### __Long-term solution: Adopting RBI in the cloud with Cloudflare__\n\nPutting aside a preference for traditional on-premise technology, Luana selected Cloudflare Browser Isolation as a cloud-delivered RBI alternative. This switch would mean that all website code would now run on Cloudflare's network – not local servers – when users browsed the Internet.\n\nLanghus had built a positive impression of Cloudflare from its contributions to Internet security at large, and during the evaluation process, was impressed by both the speed of the Cloudflare network and the collaboration across product, engineering, and sales teams. \n\nTransitioning was \"absolutely seamless,\" according to Langhus, and so far, has continued to keep the organization safe and productive without any downtime.\n\n### __Rigorous security with simplified policy management__\n\nFirst, Luana continues to save precious time and thousands of dollars in machine repairs annually by avoiding malware infections.\n\n\"With Cloudflare Browser Isolation, we're blocking threats so much earlier than any other security device that catches or mitigates cyber security issues,\" says Langhus. \"Malicious code doesn't hit our computers. Browser Isolation is the quickest and easiest way that we can deal with malware issues.\" \n\nPlus, Cloudflare's simplified policy management experience makes it easier for Langhus's team to set granular rules for specific user groups. Configurations that used to take Langhus \"three hours per month\" with the on-premise RBI now take \"minutes\" and \"as few as 90 seconds\" with Cloudflare – as much as a 99% improvement in administrative efficiency.\n\n### __Delivering fast, consistent end user experiences__\n\nEnd users also benefit from fast and unintrusive isolated sessions that feel closer to native browsing. Luana's prior RBI service struggled with latency, particularly with scrolling on bandwidth-intensive pages with video, audio, or interactive components. Those complaints have gone away since the switch to Cloudflare.\n\n\"The move to Cloudflare brought exceptional isolated browsing performance that consistently meets or beats our prior on-prem RBI,\" Langus said. \n\nWith the previous on-premise RBI, traffic remained within a traditional network perimeter – from on-site devices to on-site RBI controls. Now with Cloudflare, Luana routes traffic outside that perimeter – from on-site devices to Cloudflare's network. Despite this fundamental architectural shift, speed and reliability have remained comparable. \n\nMoreover, Luana has relied on RBI to control how users interact with Internet pages, including blocking upload and downloads of data and restricting printing. But, according to Langhus, with the prior on-premise RBI, \"it was really hit or miss whether those data protection controls actually worked.\" \n\n\"Since transitioning to Cloudflare,\" he continued, \"usability for everyone has been much better, and controls are applied more consistently.\"\n\n### __Improving technology efficiency__\n\nUltimately, implementing Cloudflare Browser Isolation has helped Luana maintain its reputation for operational and technology efficiency.\n\n\"Cloudflare and its RBI service have allowed us to stay lean and keep our budget down,\" Langhus says. \"We don't need to hire experts to deal with security issues or spend time deploying or fixing computers.\"\n\nLuana will continue to maintain a majority of its infrastructure on-premise, but is exploring the broader potential of applying Zero Trust security best practices for applications and data, particularly for employees who work outside the bank's branches in the field. In the meantime, however, Langhus will continue to evangelize the benefits for RBI.\n\n\"RBI is an effective technology that just needs to get in the right hands,\" Langhus said. \"Cloudflare has lowered the bar to entry, and I hope more people will recognize the benefits and not be afraid to just get in there and use it.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps to safeguard Villeroy & Boch's global ecommerce infrastructure__\n\nVilleroy & Boch is one of the world's leading premium brands for ceramic products. Founded in 1748 and headquartered in Mettlach, Germany, the family-owned company stands for innovation, tradition and style. As a renowned lifestyle brand, Villeroy & Boch is represented in 125 countries with products in the Bathroom & Wellness and Dining & Lifestyle segments.\nThe company continues to expand and innovate by growing their global direct-to-consumer ecommerce infrastructure. Villeroy and Boch report annual revenues totaling €945 million. \n\n### __Challenge: Securing international websites in a rapidly expanding ecommerce infrastructure__\n\nTo better meet the demands of an expanding marketplace, Villeroy & Boch recently moved a large portion of their infrastructure and internal applications — including content management systems for regional marketing websites, and Commerce Cloud, their sales platform — to the cloud. \n\nWith over 70% of its internal applications offsite, however, the company recognized the urgency of securing them against mounting threats like bot attacks, DDoS, and inventory hoarding.  \n\n\"The risk of malicious activity on the web has only increased over the years,\" explains Erik Heinen, Villeroy & Boch's Lead CIT for CRM & ECM. \"Shifting our business to the cloud required a much stronger focus on security.\" \n\n### __Using Cloudflare layer 7 services to rapidly secure complex web applications__\n\nLooking for a solution, Villeroy & Boch conducted extensive research and compiled a list of potential security partners. Based on their findings, the team selected Cloudflare layer 7 services — [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/), [DDoS Protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/), and [Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/) —  to secure their growing cloud infrastructure.    \n\n\"Cloudflare was one of the only vendors that met all of our technical and budgetary requirements,\" says Heinen. \"The dedication and flexibility of the Cloudflare team during the discovery process made them our first choice.\"\n\nWorking closely with the Villeroy & Boch team to ensure smooth onboarding, Cloudflare lived up to the company's expectations. \n\n\"Support during the implementation was excellent. Cloudflare worked with us day and night to get everything running,\" says Schneider. \"The few times we had an issue, the Cloudflare team was on hand to solve it almost immediately.\" \n\nCloudflare customer support engineers (CSEs) also collaborated with the engineering team to complete the integration of Villeroy & Boch's Commerce Cloud e-commerce portals.\n\n\"Our Commerce Cloud was a complex application to set up,\" says Schneider. \"I don't think it would have been nearly as efficient, or even possible, to manage its configuration without the support of Cloudflare CSEs.\"\n\n### __Improving performance and mitigating sophisticated attacks with the Cloudflare WAF, Bot Management, and DDoS Protection__\n\nWith the implementation complete, Cloudflare security improvements have led to significant performance gains. The Cloudflare WAF has substantially reduced the company's server loads by automatically mitigating malicious server traffic. \n\n\"We immediately saw a huge difference in reduced bot traffic and SQL injection attempts with the WAF stopping a variety of attacks at the Cloudflare level,\" says Schneider. \"Because our servers are no longer overloaded, we have also reduced our hardware requirements even though we are constantly extending and improving our web application infrastructure.\"    \n\nSince its implementation, Cloudflare Bot Management and DDoS mitigation have also been a critical part of the Villeroy & Boch security arsenal. The service has already protected their UK, Ukrainian, Swedish, and Norwegian websites against several out-of-country attacks.\n\n\"The best thing about Cloudflare security is its complete automation. We saw immediate results with only basic configuration,\" says Schneider. \"During recent attacks, we used Cloudflare to get our stores back up and running. We could never have done that with our previous vendor setup.\"     \n\nAdditionally, Villeroy & Boch's Swedish and Norwegian operations experienced inventory hoarding bots on their ecommerce platforms. A sophisticated attacker was using scripts to generate a high volume of online orders that limited the amount of inventory available to genuine customers.\n\n\"Using Cloudflare, we were able to isolate the origin of the attack,\" says Schneider. \"We reacted quickly to set up new rules that stopped the bot attack before it could do actual damage to our business or reputation.\" \n\nNow that Cloudflare has secured the Villeroy and Boch infrastructure, and the company has completed the majority of their cloud migration, they have widened their ambitions. Villeroy & Boch are focusing on both security and performance by migrating websites from their current provider to Cloudflare DNS Management. \n\n\"Cloudflare has been extremely professional,\" says Heinen. \"They have helped us more efficiently manage and secure our infrastructure. It gives peace of mind to know that we have an excellent product in front of our applications to protect us.\"   \n",

						"shortDescription": "As online business becomes more important for Conrad Electronic, they use Cloudflare to streamline development, protect ecommerce websites against sophisticated bot attacks, and simplify user access",
						"longDescription": "## __Conrad Electronic cuts costs and reduces system complexity by consolidating vendors with Cloudflare__\n\nSince 1923, Conrad Electronic have been a reliable partner when it comes to technology and Electronics. Today, as a sourcing platform, the company provides all parts for a successful sourcing of technical supplies. At Conrad, business customers get exactly what makes their project or business a success: a wide and deep product range comprising seven million products, customer-centric solutions and services, and face-to-face expert advice.\nConrad's tailored e-procurement solutions simplify complex sourcing processes and help business of all types and sizes save time and costs. By selling their products on Conrad Marketplace, manufacturers and distributors are able to attract new customers and open up new markets quickly. Private customers also benefit from industrial-grade products and services. Conrad Electronic are a family-owned business based in Hirschau (Bavaria, Germany) that operates in 17 European countries.\n\n### __Challenge: Automating threat protection, securing a cloud migration, empowering business agility, and improving the customer experience__\n\nWhen Conrad Electronic began migrating its data centers and web hosting to the cloud, they struggled to find a suitable partner to secure their public-facing infrastructure against external threats. Their existing cloud provider's DDoS and bot mitigation tools failed to handle brute force attacks, and other providers they evaluated provided sub-par customer service.     \n\n\"Our cloud provider didn't offer the automated protection we needed — when we had to address a new attack vector, they would provide configuration sets we could enable, but, to stay protected, we had to take care of everything manually,\" says Janek Wonner, Conrad Electronic's Head of SRE and Cloud Technology. \"When we looked for a better alternative, most vendors just weren't as customer friendly as Cloudflare. One even wanted to bill us for every customer support call.\" \n\nOn top of these security concerns, Conrad needed a technology partner that could support a strategic shift in its business model.  Five years ago, Conrad changed course from a classic technology retailer to a B2B sourcing platform. The majority of this transformation is almost complete. The focus is on business customers and digital business. Here, ecommerce and the related possibilities of modern procurement are becoming increasingly important in order to optimize purchasing processes and make them more efficient.\n\n\"Ecommerce will be our primary sales channel,\" explains Wonner. \"We must ensure our customers have a reliable online purchasing experience. \"We also need to reduce our DevOps effort with a stable platform to create and deploy applications on.\" \n\nThe dramatic shift in strategy instilled urgency for the nine-person Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team to bolster security for their ecommerce platform and 15 online shops. \n\nTo unlock the business agility they needed to support this e-commerce shift, Conrad also sought to deliver a faster, safer way for employees to access internal resources and developer environments. The starting point for this initiative would be retiring Conrad's legacy VPN, which demanded excessive maintenance and slowed connectivity for end users.\n\n### __Solution: Mitigating bot attacks and securing an ecommerce platform with out-of-the-box Cloudflare security__ \n\nAfter exploring several options, Conrad turned to Cloudflare, adopting the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), DDoS mitigation, and Rate Limiting to address its security concerns while migrating their web hosting to the cloud. From the outset, Cloudflare addressed both Conrad's customer service and automated security requirements.    \n\n\"It's a good partnership. Cloudflare offers us excellent value, and interacting with their entire team is uncomplicated. That had a huge impact on our decision,\" says Wonner. \"We just set it and forget it. We don't need to think about security — that is why we outsourced in the first place.\"\n\nSince its implementation, Cloudflare has prevented several potentially costly incidents. These include multiple credential-stuffing attacks on Conrad's ecommerce platform following a series of security breaches, e.g. at a major German telecom.\n\n\"When other companies experienced a data leak, the attackers would often try the stolen email and password combinations on our sites,\" says Wonner. \"We always knew when there was another attack, but it was business as usual because Cloudflare detected and stopped it before it became a problem.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Access — Eliminating VPN maintenance distractions to focus on critical business application development__\n\nThe Conrad group has 2,300 employees, with around 1,000 regularly connecting to internal applications via a traditional VPN. Unfortunately, the process for end users to configure VPNs on their devices was complex and prevented many employees from accessing what they needed in a timely manner.\n\n\"Everyone who wanted to access an internal system had to install a VPN client and configure it according to a specific VPN profile, but not everyone has a technical background,\" says Wonner. \"Just keeping people online created a series of administrative bottlenecks.\" \n\nAddressing VPN-related help desk tickets created a maintenance burden for the SRE team, which took away time and attention from the strategic shift to a B2B-first e-commerce model. As a result, maintaining this legacy VPN was becoming increasingly inefficient and costly. \n\nEncouraged by their prior positive experience with Cloudflare, Conrad decided that Cloudflare Access, a [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/), would enable the organization to retire its VPN and deliver a faster, safer authentication experience. In just over a year, Conrad retired over 1,000 VPN connections and enabled identity-based security checks for hundreds of applications. This ensured their employees had a consistent, low-friction authentication experience. \n\n\"Everything is easier with Access,\" says Wonner. \"All internal and external resources that have an account with our identity provider can quickly connect to specific systems using a single sign-on. We can also restrict specific individuals or secure sensitive areas with a mouse click.  Not having to maintain 1,000 VPN profiles improves our security and saves us time and money.\"\n\nConrad's SRE team also takes advantage of Cloudflare's compatibility with Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code service, to automate key workflows. Specifically, the SRE team has automated the process of onboarding employees, provisioning and configuring policies for new applications, updating user groups, and creating service tokens.\n\n\"We have hundreds of Access applications, but when we configure something once, it's automatically done for all domains and subdomains,\" says Wonner. \"Every month that frees up at least 10 hours we can dedicate to improving our ecommerce platform.\" \n\n### __Reducing developer and administrative efforts with the Cloudflare Developer Platform and Advanced Certificate Management__\n\nCommitted to reducing system complexity using the Cloudflare single-solution ecosystem, Conrad has also implemented the Cloudflare Workers development platform. The six-person front-end development team uses Workers to redirect and route traffic on the Cloudflare network and perform hardware-intensive tasks like edge-side includes.   \n\n\"We have plenty going on with Workers and Workers KV,\" says Wonner. \"We currently generate over 1 billion Workers requests every month across several use cases.\" \n\nThe Cloudflare Wrangler command-line tool allows the team to generate, configure, build, preview, and publish Cloudflare Worker projects directly from their development environments.\n\nConrad also uses Cloudflare Advanced Certificate Management. According to Wonner, this service saves the company 120 hours every year while effortlessly maintaining the secure encryption of its 15 ecommerce sites and 33 domains.\n\n\"SSL certificates were awful to manage, but now we just add our domains and Cloudflare automatically renews them,\" says Wonner. \"We have no more work to do there, and we no longer risk one of our shops going down because somebody forgot to renew the SSL.\"\n\nConrad wants to become Europe's leading sourcing platform for technical supplies and currently plans to continue its relationship with Cloudflare. It is a decision based on the no-nonsense partnership the two companies have formed.    \n\n\"Cloudflare are reliable both in terms of the security they provide and the instant availability of their support. I can rely on that — I don't need to check to be sure the system is working.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Japan Airlines leverages Cloudflare to safeguard their employees from malicious emails and reduce operational inefficiencies__\n\nJapan Airlines (JAL) is one of Japan's leading high-quality airlines, with over 35,000 employees. JAL provides domestic and international passenger and cargo services to hundreds of destinations worldwide, striving to contribute to the stable flow of people and commodities. JAL is a critical infrastructure operator providing public transportation with corporate social responsibilities related to information security. \n\n### __Challenge: Ensuring high level security for Japan Airlines' email__\nJapan Airlines takes email security very seriously. With tens of thousands of employees, email is an important means of communication and commerce. Manabu Yamawaki, Assistant Manager of Information Security Strategies Office in the IT Planning & Management department, shares that, \"IT security is a common issue in modern society. As a critical infrastructure operator responsible for public transportation, all of our stakeholders rightfully demand an appropriate approach to information security, supported by world-class information technology - it's one of our corporate social responsibilities.\" \n\nMr Yamawaki likens IT security to flight safety – it is of utmost importance, and cannot be maintained by staying status quo. It needs constant action and evolvement. In order to ensure security, he believes JAL must continue to stay on top of the ever-changing business and IT environment landscape. \n\nJAL needed first-class email security, and the software they were using did not satisfy them adequately. Malware emails were still slipping through the cracks.\n\n\"We had another email security product in place, and while we weren't experiencing major problems, some phishing emails, such as Emotet malware, were still slipping through. So, we started looking for other email solutions, specifically one that could score full marks in terms of email security at the time of the email product change. This was when JAL discovered and switched to Cloudflare.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare brings a new sense of greater functionality__\n\nTraditional email security products are tightly coupled with email software in a series of connections, with the security product only handling email security. However, Cloudflare takes full advantage of the native security functions of an organization's email service. \n\nMr Yamawaki also observed that Cloudflare had reduced the operational inefficiencies and burden for both the users and administrators. With the previous email solution, if a user received a suspicious email, they would receive a digest email listing all suspicious emails. This required the user to check whether each email was necessary and then take action; now, they only need to check their junk mail folder periodically. \n\n### __Celebrating the ease of use__\nFor JAL, the Cloud Email Security set-up was easy and smooth, with architecture, migration, and operational requirements all completed in only a short period of time -  a major boon given their short runway at the time. On top of that, they're highly satisfied with the level of accuracy in detecting malicious emails and with the API's ease-of-use.\n\n\"I often tell coworkers how Cloudflare Cloud Email Security is both simple and easy to use as a cloud-based SaaS solution and discuss how satisfied I am with its high level accuracy.\" Manabu Yamawaki, JAL Security Strategy Office\n\n### __Getting the support they need__\nMr Yamawaki has also been pleased with the level of assistance he's received from Cloudflare support with Premium Success.\n\n\"From the introduction of the product up to this day, the Cloudflare team has given us a detailed level of support. Thanks to that, we were able to migrate our email security solution in an exceptionally smooth way. We've been able to have regular meetings with the Cloudflare teams where they heard and understood our issues, and equipped us with the necessary information to resolve them.\"\n\n\"The support teams have told us about functionalities that we might otherwise not know about in our regular usage and are so helpful when we want to know more. There's a great deal of merit in being able to receive useful advice from them.\"\n\nReceiving this level of support and partnership with Cloudflare has proven to be highly beneficial for JAL, as they now have greater peace of mind, knowing that their emails are kept safe from malicious attacks.\n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare helps Classmethod secure application and Internet access from a single platform",
						"longDescription": "## __Classmethod achieves secure remote access with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nFounded in 2004, Classmethod has emerged as a leading Japanese cloud integrator that provides technical consulting, development, support, and operations across big data, mobile, and artificial intelligence use cases. Today, Classmethod employs over hundreds of workers across  seven offices in Japan and six overseas across Canada, Germany, India, South Korea; Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\nLike many organizations in early 2020, Classmethod switched to remote working in response to the global pandemic. This sudden shift forced Classmethod to reevaluate its overall approach to IT and security, particularly to secure employee access to internal applications and to protect workers from malware and other Internet threats. \n\n### __Challenge: Lost security controls and risks of remote access__\n\nWhen employees started working remotely, Classmethod could no longer rely on the network-based protections and controls within the company's physical offices. Within its offices, Classmethod could enforce authentication to company resources via its identity provider, Azure Active Directory, and could block employees from browsing unwanted or harmful Internet content via web filtering.\n\nLooking ahead, Classmethod recognized that as pandemic restrictions were lifted, employees – particularly its sales teams – would be interested in working from cafes, co-working spaces, or other public spaces where connecting over public Wi-Fi could be a risk. To date, Classmethod had given employees mobile Wireless Access Points (or mobile hotspots) to avoid risks like Wi-Fi snooping, on-path attacks, and DNS cache poisoning. Deploying this hardware was not only costly, but also inconvenienced users. Over time, Classmethod knew it needed a more streamlined way to protect employees from public Wi-Fi risks while maintaining an encrypted connection to the Internet or other internal environments.\n\n\"Of course, not all public Wi-Fis are dangerous, but it's impractical for our Information Systems Department to identify which ones are safe and which ones are dangerous,\" said Mr. Kazuki Ueki from Classmethod's Information Systems Department. \"We wanted to create a stress-free working environment for our employees, so we need an approach that could provide secure access to our internal systems that could be available over public Wi-Fis.\"\n\n### __Consolidating secure access and threat protection with Cloudflare__\n\nIn late 2021, Classmethod saw an opportunity to address its application and Internet access concerns with a single vendor by adopting Cloudflare Zero Trust for its entire distributed workforce, across all locations in Japan, the rest of Asia, and Europe. \n\n\"We adopted Cloudflare Zero Trust to support secure access and threat defense in a single platform. Setting identity-aware policies integrated with our Microsoft Azure AD environment has been really easy for our administrators and gives them the controls to keep our users safe.\" said Mr. Ueki.\n\nFirst, Cloudflare Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service would secure employees reaching internal applications by first authenticating each request with identity-based check against Classmethod's Azure AD. With this method, Classmethod no longer needed to set location- and IP-based access policies. \n\nSecond, from the same policy dashboard, Classmethod could now set DNS filtering policies to block employees from reaching harmful web content with risks like ransomware and phishing.\n\n\"Currently, our employees generate 37 million requests to the Internet per week, out of which we block around 4,000 of them as dangerous sites,\" Mr. Ueki said. \"Cloudflare not only blocks direct access to dangerous sites, but also prevents unauthorized access that goes on in the background, hidden behind ads or web beacons that appear on safe sites.\"\n\nClassmethod was particularly impressed by its ability to address both these application access and Internet protection needs with a single device client, which was deployed via a mobile device management (MDM) tool. With Cloudflare's device client, Classmethod can enforce encrypted connections for all remote users, reducing the company's concerns for using public Wi-Fi. Over time, this will allow Classmethod to reduce the number of mobile hotspots it deploys and further lower its hardware costs.\n\n\"Cloudflare's device client is providing secure, encrypted connections whether a user is running a PC in a cafe or a co-working space,\" Mr Ueki said. \"Since deployment, the Information Systems Department has not heard of any complaints from employees.\"\n\n### __Next steps: Unifying corporate network security and on-ramps__\n\nNow that Classmethod has secured remote access to applications and their Internet, it is exploring new opportunities to simplify the organization's overall corporate network and expanding on-ramps to include the use of smartphones. Additionally, they are looking into Cloudflare Cloud Email Security, with the aim of eliminating phishing, malware, and unscannable attachments (e.g. password-protected zip files) sent to inboxes from either external or internal senders.\n\n\"Cloudflare Zero Trust is recommended as a service for companies that have a lot of remote workers, or companies where employees use their personal computers externally while on the go,\" Mr. Ueki said. \"Even when you set up a new office, your initial and operating costs could potentially be lower because you can provide an inexpensive private networking environment without the need to install costly leased lines. When we were setting up a new office in South Korea, we were able to get the network access ready early on by using Cloudflare Zero Trust. This would have been much more difficult with any other solution.\" \n",

Their strong focus on tech innovation and open banking solutions is complemented by exceptional client service, enabling a \"high tech, high touch\" experience.\n\n### __Challenge: Finding the right performance, security, and development partner for an international open banking platform__\n\nWhen Investec began their strategic expansion into digital banking channels, their primary concerns were securing and connecting their online services to an international user base.\n\n\"Having a secure digital security posture is paramount for us. As a financial services provider, it's critical that we ensure our clients' peace of mind,\" says Christopher Naidoo, Investec's Head of Digital IT Operations. \"But, we were also looking for efficient ways to build out our digital strategy.\" \n\nInvestec's list of requirements grew alongside their portfolio of online services. Their focus shifted from content delivery to finding an innovative solution partner that could anticipate their development needs as they embraced open banking standards.  \n\n\"Putting great services and solutions into our clients' hands at pace was important to us,\" says Naidoo. \"Achieving that meant finding a partnership that enhanced our technology architecture and the way we provide our services by helping us move some of our solutions to the network edge.\"  \n\n### __Cloudflare helps mitigate sophisticated security threats and secure user financial data__\n\nInvestec partnered with Cloudflare after extensive research into multiple networking and security providers. The bank based their decision on an ongoing dialogue with the Cloudflare engineering teams and extensive proof of concept (POC) testing to ensure Cloudflare met their specific needs. Cloudflare rapidly became central to the bank's cloud development strategy.\n\n\"Our early interactions with Cloudflare and the deep POCs we conducted are one of the best investments Investec has made,\" says Naidoo. \"Cloudflare stood out for how easy its platform and services were to use — everything from onboarding to interacting via the Cloudflare portal or API was seamless.\"\n\nCloudflare helps Investec anticipate and mitigate sophisticated attacks while strengthening their overall security posture. With Cloudflare Zero Trust, Investec can connect and secure their users and data while deflecting ransomware attempts, phishing, zero-day vulnerability exploits, and more. Cloudflare L7 security tools further [secure](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) Investec websites and online applications.  \n\n\"In the current landscape, especially in the financial services industry, DDoS attacks and botnets could bring down our services, networks, and data centers,\" explains Naidoo. \"Cloudflare makes us proactive rather than reactive — we can take a long-term strategic approach to our security while remaining nimble and able to react to sudden threats. That keeps our clients' money and information safe.\" \n\n### __Creating open banking applications and integrations on the Cloudflare Developer Platform__\n\nInvestec uses Cloudflare to create banking opportunities for their clients and power many of its advanced online banking offerings and alternative integrations. This includes an industry first — Investec Programmable Banking. Programmable Banking offers Investec private banking and business clients access to their banking and transactional data and the power to craft individualised banking services.\n\nIn order to implement this solution for their global — and growing — client base, Investec needed a strong development partner. The Cloudflare development platform, Workers, helped them seamlessly create and deploy the new functionality, backed by the speed and scale of Cloudflare's global network.\n\n\"The Cloudflare Developer Platform and Workers are central to our ability to provide user-programmable functionality. It is just one example of how we leverage Cloudflare capabilities to enhance our technology and deliver value to our clients.\"   \n\nAs Investec continue to develop cutting-edge banking tools, Naidoo sees the role of Cloudflare expanding within their development roadmap. Cloudflare Zero Trust will help secure access to company assets, while Workers' Terraform integration will further streamline the deployment, configuration, and interoperability of the bank's cloud-based applications.   \n\n\"We want to be even more innovative and drive that concept of integration to allow each client's creativity to determine new uses. With Cloudflare, we can create and secure a plug-and-play network that puts that type of functionality at their fingertips,\" says Naidoo. \"We can work in a better way to strategically move our business forward and more rapidly personalize our clients' financial experience.\"\n\nFor Investec, forming relationships that improve both performance and innovation is the key to success. Investec saw the same ethos in Cloudflare from their earliest interactions.\n\n\"Cloudflare mirrored our own vision to create a digital platform that integrated multiple services into a one-stop solution with a great user experience, great security, and great functionality,\" says Naidoo. \"They immediately understood where we wanted to go, and that is why our relationship has prospered. The real benefit of this partnership has come from the people.\" \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Global lifestyle brand Ted Baker creates a first-class customer experience with web performance and security solutions from Cloudflare__\n\nTed Baker is a global lifestyle brand whose innovative collections include men's, women's, and children's clothing, footwear, jewelry, bedding, luggage, and more. \n\nThe company distributes its products across five continents through multiple channels. The retail channel includes an extensive online presence as well as 377 retail stores and concessions worldwide. The company also distributes products through wholesale and licensing relationships. \n\n### __Challenge: Deliver an unparalleled online shopping experience regardless of geography__\n\nRecently, Ted Baker launched a new digital platform with the goal of enhancing the customer experience to increase conversion and drive higher digital sales. As the company prepared for the platform launch, there were concerns that web page download times in some parts of the world weren't meeting customer expectations. One reason was that the content delivery network in use at that time didn't have image repositories close enough to the geographies served by Ted Baker's retail network. \n\nAnother reason was the DDoS attacks, malicious bots, and other threats that virtually every [ecommerce site](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) experiences. These attacks can overload a site with malicious traffic, severely degrading performance. Multiple times a week, the Ted Baker security team would receive alerts indicating a possible threat — forcing them to scramble to mount a manual response.\n\nThe Ted Baker team wanted a way to place image repositories closer to customers to accelerate image downloads. The company also wanted to strengthen protection against threats without requiring a hands-on response every time. \n\n### __The solution: Cloudflare delivers exceptional performance for a more satisfying online shopping experience__\n\nTed Baker quickly identified Cloudflare as the optimum solution to address the company's concerns. The primary reasons: Cloudflare's extensive global network and its [robust application and website security capabilities](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/). The result is a secure and [highly performant ecommerce environment](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/). \n\nAccording to Jagjot Singh, Information Security Officer at Ted Baker, the Cloudflare implementation is enhancing the customer experience. \"Slow image download times frustrate online shoppers,\" Singh explains. \"For us, that can mean lost revenue. Cloudflare boosts our performance at least 23%, which keeps customers on our site.\"\n\n### __Maintaining fast performance regardless of geography or network conditions__\n\nTed Baker uses Cloudflare's global network to cache product images and details close to customers. Thanks to Cloudflare's presence in 275 cities and 100 countries, customers anywhere can load images with minimal latency.\n\nTed Baker customers vary widely in the type and quality of Internet connections they have available. A major Cloudflare benefit is its ability to recognize connection quality for any individual user and compress images accordingly, which improves image download times for customers with low-quality Internet connections. Consequently, the Ted Baker staff no longer spends time searching through logs and checking IP addresses to determine why certain customers experience slow performance.\n\nIn addition, Cloudflare Argo Smart Routing monitors the network in real-time looking for performance degradation. When it detects slowdowns, Argo automatically reroutes traffic through the most efficient path to ensure fast load times.\n\n### __Protecting against known and emerging threats__ \n\nCloudflare protects Ted Baker against a variety of external threats — particularly DDoS attacks and malicious bot traffic — that might degrade performance. The Ted Baker team was particularly impressed by how easy it was to set up the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF). Its threat intelligence capabilities block for emerging threats, ensuring that Ted Baker isn't caught off guard. \n\nCloudflare has also spared Ted Baker from the effort of responding to each attack manually. \"We have been with Cloudflare for almost a year, and there hasn't been a single instance where we had to jump in to mitigate an issue,\" Singh notes. \"Cloudflare manages everything for us, so we spend zero time and effort handling tasks like whitelisting IP addresses or mitigating DDoS attacks. It has been a more than worthwhile investment.\"\n\nCloudflare solutions are blocking 100% of Ted Baker's DDoS attacks, malicious bot activity, and other threats, freeing up significant staff time to focus on strategic projects.\n\n### __Achieving and communicating success__\n\nCloudflare helps the Ted Baker team improve the company's ecommerce environment. What's more, it provides the team with the vehicle to communicate that success to management.\n\n\"Cloudflare easily translates to people who don't speak the language of technology.\" notes Singh. \"So it's easy for me to present technical information to senior management and the board. Cloudflare provides that entire bridge between technical details and informative business communication so we can clearly convey the value we are getting from our investment.\"\n",

I'm the CTO of Ausha. Ausha is the first podcast marketing platform with all the tools a podcaster needs to launch their show.\n\n### __Why did you start using Cloudflare?__\n\nWe are hosting podcasts, and we track downloads because our users need to know how their shows perform. We were using a competitor CDN which was working great for content delivery, but was regularly unstable for logging, providing logs late or never. We went to Cloudflare just looking for a CDN which would work.\n\n### __What benefits have you seen since using Cloudflare?__\n\nAs a CDN, Cloudflare just works day after day after day, it works and delivers logs in a timely manner. So just for that, switching to Cloudflare was a success. But then we also discovered there was a big bunch of cherries on the cake. Of course, Cloudflare is a CDN. But it also comes with a nice analytic platform allowing us to dig in the logs to graph stuff to really see what is going on. Something we would have done manually with a lot of effort, and we might have reached half of what they give us out of the box. Another cherry is protection. After all, Cloudflare is well known in the market for that. And knowing we have a battlefield tested DDoS protection in front of us is giving us peace of mind. Adding to that, the fact, you are intuitive and smooth...you have a happy customer.\n\n### __What is your favorite thing about Cloudflare?__\n\nI really like Cloudflare's reliability.

						"longDescription": "## __Improving PhonePe — Accelerating and securing over 3.6 billion monthly mobile payment transactions with Cloudflare__\n\nMobile payment systems are changing how the world transacts, and no country has adopted digital payments more rapidly  and on a larger scale than India. PhonePe leads that paradigm shift. \n\nWith a user base of nearly one in every four Indian citizens, PhonePe is a clear leader in the Indian digital payment space and in India's premier mobile payment platform [in every metric](https://inc42.com/buzz/phonepe-maintains-lead-in-upi-with-49-market-share-in-jan-2022-whatsapp-at-0-02/), consistently outperforming competitors. \n\n### __The Challenge: Ensuring compliant, secure, and low-latency financial transactions during daily high-traffic clusters__  \n\nScaling to meet their rapid growth — PhonePe has over 435 million registered users and processes over 3.6 billion transactions monthly. Given the scale the  company operates at, PhonePe was under pressure to provide secure, frictionless and quick service. \n\nWith their peak periods defining their network requirements, PhonePe sought a content delivery network (CDN) with the elasticity to absorb every daily traffic surge. More importantly, that solution had to handle dynamic traffic without introducing any latency that might undermine the user experience.\n\n\"Each transaction should take three seconds to complete — as that time increases, people lose patience. Once a transaction reaches 12 seconds, our users assume we are having problems, and volumes drop to zero as they turn to our competitors,\" says Burzin Engineer, PhonePe Co-founder and Chief Reliability Officer. \n\nBecause the quality of their customer experience is so significant to customer retention, PhonePe also needed a way to manage and efficiently deliver their static image and video content. \n\nNext, as a fintech platform partnering with banks, PhonePe wanted a single solution to provide real-time protection against threats like DDoS, malicious bots, and SQL injections. It also had to ensure instantaneous financial transactions on a massive scale.  \n\n\" Over 33 million merchants depend on PhonePe to fulfill their transactions, and we are under attack 24/7, 365 days a year,\" says Engineer. \"We needed the right partner and security tooling to thrive.\"\n\n### __Blocking malicious international traffic and promoting regulatory compliance with the Cloudflare WAF__  \n\nPhonePe selected Cloudflare as their [security solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) and content delivery partner based on a shared commitment to providing modern solutions and exceptional customer service. \n\n\"The Cloudflare tech stack interested us. Compared to the other vendors, it wasn't carrying the baggage of 20-year-old technologies,\" says Engineer. \"Cloudflare was newer and had a modern API-driven CDN purpose-built from the ground up.\"       \n\nThe company leadership was also banking on Cloudflare's commitment to developing relationships in India and improving the topology of its content delivery infrastructure nationwide.\n\nPhonePe began with the Cloudflare core security portfolio. With all of PhonePe's business conducted domestically, the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), managed rulesets, and the ability to geo-block traffic resulted in immediate security benefits. \n\n\"Using the Cloudflare WAF, we cut off more than 90% of malicious attacks by restricting traffic to sources within India,\" says Engineer. \"It gives us peace of mind to know that because everything flows through Cloudflare, we can protect our ingress and egress and keep our customers' data and money safe.\"\n\nCloudflare plays a key role in ensuring PhonePe maintains that critical uptime. Monthly, it detected and neutralized 180 million threats to the PhonePe application layer.   \n\nIn addition to protecting PhonePe's applications, Cloudflare simplifies the security auditing process and helps the platform meet its compliance requirements. The announcement that Cloudflare will [comply fully](https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/will-become-data-localization-compliant-in-india-by-decend-11661716747206.html) with India's incoming data localization and data residency requirements by the end of 2022 further eased PhonePe's regulatory needs. \n\n### __Cloudflare Workers and Stream: serverless image resizing and adaptive bitrate video delivery for a smooth, responsive user experience__\n\nWith their security and compliance concerns addressed and their applications and networks protected, PhonePe concentrated on further enhancing their user experience using Workers and the API-first Cloudflare global network.\n\nInitially, PhonePe optimized their millions of source images locally to ensure they were responsive on any device and to improve performance at the point of service. The resizing process required over 50 bare-metal origin servers — Cloudflare Workers eliminated the need for those machines. \n\n\"Once we offloaded the dynamic resizing and delivery of images for over 200 devices to Workers, all we needed to provide was a single high-resolution source image,\" explains Engineer. \"Workers resize, cache, and serve those images for us. It saves PhonePe resources, space and power. It also improves the user experience because it's faster.\"\n\nWith support from the Cloudflare engineering team, PhonePe conceived and implemented the change in under two months.\n\nAfter the success of offloading their responsive image processing to the edge, PhonePe moved on to optimizing their video content delivery. They chose Stream, the [live](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/live-streaming/) and on-demand Cloudflare video service that dynamically adapts each stream to network conditions. The Stream service proved ideal for mitigating video delivery issues caused by inconsistent mobile internet performance.\n\n\"Stream changes bitrate based on available bandwidth,\" says Engineer. \"Before we could choose from three bitrates but it was a one-time decision. Now, Stream changes rate dynamically and eliminates stall and jitter and improves our customer experience.\" \n\nUsing Workers and the Cloudflare global network, PhonePe now offloads an average of 80% of the traffic from their origin servers and enjoys corresponding savings in bandwidth and a 10x reduction in infrastructure costs. In a month, Cloudflare serves 775 billion requests for PhonePe — over 289,000 requests per second and their merchant notifications and image resizing use cases trigger 50 billion Workers requests.\n\nFor PhonePe, where network and security issues directly affect their customers and merchant partners, proactive Cloudflare support translates to peace of mind. \n\n\"It is comforting to have Cloudflare to tell us exactly what is happening, why it happened, and how the support team is coming together to fix it,\" says Engineer. \"While no company can guarantee perfection, how they react to problems shows you their true character, and Cloudflare's character is impeccable.\"\n",

Beyond just the performance gains, this caching of our content makes it possible to accommodate even more students while taking the load off our infrastructures.\" \n\n### __Secure protection against online attacks__\n\nOpenClassrooms also trusts Cloudflare to ensure the security of its infrastructure. \"We must constantly strengthen our security, because the number of attacks continues to increase with our change of scale,\" says Jonathan Lefèbvre. \n\nTo combat these issues, OpenClassrooms began using the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS mitigation. Right away, Cloudflare helped OpenClassrooms deal with complex, highly distributed attacks that may target any number of the countries the organization serves. Overall, Cloudflare has allowed OpenClassrooms to mitigate 99% of their attacks. \"Last March, for example, we logged 12 million security alerts, all blocked by Cloudflare. At the beginning, we relied on the rules provided out-of-the-box, which are very powerful in themselves. We then customized them to take into account our specific use cases,\" said Jonathan Lefèbvre. \"We found you can activate a layer 7 firewall with Cloudflare with a single click. It is very reassuring to be able to rely on a quality partner like Cloudflare against hackers.\" \n\nBeyond the protection of course content, OpenClassrooms must also ensure the confidentiality of its users' data. \"It is our reputation that is at stake, so it is fundamental for the development of the company that we have a partner like Cloudflare that helps us stay compliant,\" underlines Jonathan Lefèbvre.\n\n### __A true Zero Trust partnership__\n\nMore recently, OpenClassrooms has adopted Cloudflare to secure remote access to corporate applications for its globally distributed workforce. Previously, OpenClassrooms relied on an on-prem VPN appliance, which required backhauling traffic through a data center in Paris for all users, whether in Europe or the US. The VPN proved a bottleneck that hurt user productivity and created risk as a single point of failure for the IT team.\n\nTo replace this VPN, the organization selected [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/), a [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/) service, to adopt identity-based authentication policies for a wide range of self-hosted, web based applications and developer environments. The native integration between Cloudflare Access and Okta was crucial in this project, allowing the rapid implementation for remote access to applications with the highest levels of security.\n\n\"Today, Cloudflare protects all of our internal applications,\" Lefèbvre said. \"Cloudflare Access was the obvious choice, because it was simpler and integrated perfectly with the rest of our tool set, especially since Cloudflare was also able to integrate with our identity provider, which was crucial for us.\"\n\nOpenClassrooms has automated the process of creating access policies for new applications and users by leveraging Cloudflare's API-based integration with [Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/), an Infrastructure-as-Code provider. This API-first approach not only helps save time in configuration, but also improves the consistency of access provisioning and makes it easier to audit changes in security policies.\n\n\"We have really developed a trusting relationship with Cloudflare over the years, especially on security issues. We have always had access to experts in the latest technologies, who really seek to help us by always putting themselves in our shoes to better understand our problems. As a customer, a supplier who is that attentive to our needs is absolutely invaluable,\" said Jonathan Lefèbvre.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __C&A goes serverless with Cloudflare to scale swiftly when online shopping soars__ \n\nC&A is a leading European fashion retailer with more than 1,300 stores in 17 countries throughout Europe. The company welcomes millions of shoppers to its physical stores every  day and is committed to creating a memorable shopping experience for each customer.\n\nIn recent years, [online shopping](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) has made up a growing percentage of C&A's revenue as the company rapidly expands its online presence to attract and retain customers who prefer to shop from home or on the go.\n\n### __The challenge: Building an ecommerce platform for hybrid retail__\n\nAs C&A mapped out its future, the IT team focused on how to best support a hybrid retail environment that delivers an optimal shopping experience, whether the customer shops in a store, online, or both. Achieving this goal requires always-on availability and [exceptional performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) of C&A's online shop. Any disruption in terms of availability or performance might frustrate customers and cause them to click their way to a competitor's site.\n\nThe team also recognized that the infrastructure needed to be nimble to accommodate unpredictable digital crowds driven by Black Friday, irresistible marketing promotions, and social media influencers. During these times, traffic can increase up to 10 times in a very short time period. \n\n\"Rapidly scaling for peaks is absolutely essential to maintaining a quality customer experience,\" explains Michael Glauche, Cloud Infrastructure Architect. \"Independent studies show that conversion rates double for every 100 milliseconds you save in response time. So we set a goal of having sub-100-millisecond response times for all pages in our online shop.\"\n\nAccording to Ulrike Otto, Head of Digital Experience, the ability to meet response time goals directly affects customer satisfaction.\n\n\"Our top priority is to pursue customers by creating a frictionless shopping experience—in store and online,\" she notes. \"For online sales, that means fast-loading personalized content pages and a platform that is always available. We needed a platform that delivers exceptional scalability and flexibility to accommodate peak traffic.\"\n\nIT leadership wanted to move beyond traditional thinking about servers and other IT infrastructure. Innovative thinking led to a serverless framework that would run operationally efficient ecommerce applications that are highly agile.\n\n### __The solution: Implement Cloudflare Workers for serverless ecommerce__\n\nC&A found a strategically aligned partner in Cloudflare. Cloudflare Workers is a serverless application platform for building and deploying JavaScript functions that run on Cloudflare's global network.\n\nThe highly dynamic Cloudflare infrastructure delivers a competitive advantage. It allows C&A to experiment with innovative ways to attract new customers and drive sales without fear of disrupting service.\n\nWith Cloudflare Workers, every developer has a digital playground for experimentation. Developers can work directly on the production ecommerce site instead of having to test new designs, applications, and features on a separate staging site first. Updating applications and code snippets in Cloudflare Workers is easy, so developers can iterate quickly without concerns that a small change might unexpectedly disrupt the business.\n\n\"We can have multiple instances of the same online shop running in production,\" says Urbanek. \"You can't do that easily with a standard on-premise setup or even cloud.\"\n\nWorkers delivers exceptional performance thanks to Cloudflare's growing number of data centers, which run code milliseconds away from users—minimizing network delays and ensuring fast performance, no matter where customers are located in the world.\n\nC&A developers use Workers to spin up serverless functions that are integral to the ecommerce experience, dynamically consuming compute and deftly handling traffic spikes. \"Backend systems simply deliver data to the customer experience platform, which puts everything together, compiles the pages, and then delivers them to online shoppers,\" says Carsten Fuchs, Business Architect at C&A.\n\n### __Serverless offers economical scaling__\n\nNot only does Workers deliver a seamless customer experience, but it also allows C&A to manage fluctuations in site traffic—up to a tenfold increase during peak periods—without breaking the bank. Compared to other serverless platforms, Workers is less expensive.\n\n\"Our online demand is unpredictable and we need the most cost-effective way to deal with that,\" Glauche notes. \"That's what Cloudflare Workers gives us.\"\n\nC&A developers appreciate the inherent scalability of the serverless framework. They can create and expand ecommerce applications without being shackled by constraints on compute or server capacity. Best of all, C&A no longer pays for compute or storage capacity that sits idle except during occasional shopping peaks.\n\n\"The business no longer needs to keep us informed as to the kind of traffic they are expecting,\" says Urbanek. \"They focus on selling as much as they can and we focus on keeping the platform stable and responsive.\"\n\n### __A secure network foundation for hybrid retail__\n\nC&A continues to expand the Cloudflare footprint in its ecommerce operations. The company relies on Cloudflare global network for ultrafast dynamic content delivery and sophisticated controls over how content is cached to improve the shopping experience and reduce bandwidth costs. \n\nCloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) protects against advanced zero-day vulnerability exploits and other application threats to guard against account takeovers, prevent data exfiltration, and stop credential stuffing.\n\n\"When the Log4j issue became known, it was reassuring to receive information from Cloudflare that they already took first countermeasures,\" says Urbanek. \"The best that can happen is that I learn about a problem people already started to mitigate.\" When the Log4j issue emerged, Cloudflare added new WAF rules that blocked it outright, ensuring protection for customers like C&A.\n\nCloudflare DDoS protection services protect C&A websites by identifying and stopping DDoS attacks at the edge in less than three seconds. Built-in analytics gives the IT team visibility into emerging attack trends. Moreover, Cloudflare Bot Management blocks bad bots to prevent unwelcome traffic that might slow down response times.\n\n### __Setting the stage for growth__\n\nC&A has ambitious plans for growth: adding retail locations in new geographies, increasing online sales, and integrating digital operations with its brick-and-mortar storefronts through click-and-collect and direct shipping options. With Cloudflare, they have a partner who can help them meet the growing needs of their global customer base.\n\nBy providing faster page loading, significantly faster content delivery, and exceptional security, Cloudflare helps C&A position itself to seamlessly scale while maintaining a competitive edge in an increasingly hybrid retail arena.\n\n\"Our partnership with Cloudflare is more than just the provider and the customer,\" says Fuchs. \"We are doing things together, and we plan to continue this way as our whole online shop will need Cloudflare in the future.\" \n",

I'm a software engineer working at DatoCMS. DatoCMS is a headless CMS that provides UI for editors to write content and upload assets. And then a set of APIs for developers that need to retrieve the content to populate their own websites, apps, or anything else they might build.\n\n### __Why did you start using Cloudflare?__\n\nWe have started using Cloudflare Workers to monitor our APIs on the edge. We needed a way to count how many API calls our users were performing or how much traffic they were consuming on the edge before our servers. And also to provide an extra layer of caching to reduce the calls to our servers. And so we are using a combination of Workers and Key Value storage to know, for example, which customers we should block because they have stopped using our service. And so to avoid having unnecessary calls to our machine. And each day we are performing more than 150 million API calls, and we are transferring more than 10 terabytes of traffic all through Cloudflare. \n\n### __What benefits have you seen since using Cloudflare?__\n\nCloudflare has allowed us to scale globally and to respond to peaks in traffic and also to block unnecessary calls to our servers, so we can reduce our maintenance time and provide a better service to our users. Even if we are a small team.\n\n### __What is your favorite thing about Cloudflare?__\n\nOur favorite thing about Cloudflare is that we can access a global and very performant CDN at a very fair price, especially for us being a small company. And this opens up a lot of possibilities that otherwise we wouldn't be able to achieve.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __With Cloudflare, Tamr achieves unparalleled protection against the #1 cyber attack vector__\n\nTamr is a highly scalable next-generation data mastering platform that allows customers to use data product templates to consolidate messy source data into clean, curated, analytics-ready datasets. Organizations benefit from Tamr Mastering, the industry's first suite of data product templates that combine human curation, patented machine learning, mastering rules and enrichment with first- and third-party data to accelerate business outcomes and deliver business-changing insights.\n\nTamr's cloud-native and SaaS solutions enable industry leaders such as Toyota, Western Union and GSK to get ahead and stay ahead in a rapidly changing competitor environment. Tamr's work in the public sector includes the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, Department of Homeland Security and various other federal and local government agencies.\n\n### __Challenge: Securing the environment, especially for email services__\n\nEnsuring airtight security for IT systems is one of Tamr's top business priorities. Tamr's lead cloud architect Nick Laferriere notes that because so many of Tamr customers are Fortune 1000 and government entities, the company must demonstrate compliance with all major security regulations and standards. \n\n\"Before these companies will consider our products, we have to fill out their security questionnaire,\" Laferriere explains. \"If we can't answer yes to all of their security requirements, we don't get a seat at the table.\" \n\nIn the past, Tamr was particularly concerned about [email security](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email-security/) because phishing is a major cybersecurity threat to organizations of all sizes. The company's Google G suite email system included some security protections, but the IT team determined that Tamr needed more robust [G Suite email protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/google/email-security/) than was available off the shelf. \n\nIn addition, the shift to remote work has increased pressure on the Tamr IT team to maintain strong security. The team is committed to enabling employees to work securely from home and be fully productive. \n\n\"The majority of our people work remotely now, and it's a different paradigm from the past,\" Laferriere says. \"But the way we selected our vendors and put together our cloud infrastructure allowed us to make the shift while continuing to operate securely.\"\n\n### __The solution: Cloudflare Email Security delivers cloud-based protection for Tamr's #1 business application__\n\nWhen Tamr sought out additional email protection seven years ago, the IT team selected Cloudflare email security for two main reasons:\n\n- The solution's robust capabilities for stopping threats at the border of the network\n- The ability to protect email without setting up physical hardware\n\n\"Cloudflare was the only solution that fit into our tech stack and that also demonstrated a compelling case around security,\" says Laferriere. He adds that it took only about an hour to configure the solution and get it running initially. \"It has worked seamlessly since the beginning and we spend very little time managing it. About once a year we take a look at the list of new features and then spend an hour or so activating the ones we want to use. So the cost of ownership for us is very low.\"\n\nAccording to Laferriere, phishing attacks tend to increase following heavy marketing and/or broadcasting activities that bring increased attention to Tamr. \"Area 1 steps in and blocks the attacks, which means we aren't even aware of them except when we take a look at the product's console.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare's email security console keeps IT informed of threats__\n\nThe Cloudflare email security console offers a variety of views that give Tamr's security team rich visibility into the volume and nature of ongoing threats. The \"malicious threat types\" view provides a breakdown of the type of threats involved and the percentage each one represents. Consequently, Tamr security people can identify their greatest areas of risk and make employees aware of the threats they need to recognize and avoid.\n\n![TAMR - Dashboard](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3retArDNcBo2ctHfBNN2w8/b395f8d2dcf9bee2adc0247a0ef9dc32/TAMR_-_Dashboard.png)\n\nThe \"total detections\" view provides visibility into the total number of email messages processed, along with insight into the percentage of malicious versus suspicious versus spam verdicts, as well as other characteristics. This information apprises the security team of the overall threat picture at any point in time.\n\n![TAMR Dashboard 2](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5xXy8QB0UuOauTaKuId4Yr/f3beedc2bd7bcfc13101527a50a8ef5a/TAMR_Dashboard_2.png)\n\nAdditional views include \"threat origins,\" which shows geographic locations where threats are generated. This information enables the security team to track concentrations of attacks from various parts of the world. \n\n### __The power of consolidating services__\n\nTamr has been using Cloudflare services like the Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS Mitigation since early 2021, and they see the benefit of being able to add email security to their Cloudflare portfolio.\n\n\"Working with a smaller number of trusted vendors simplifies the purchasing and management of solutions and strengthens vendor partnerships,\" Laferriere says. \n\n\"We are confident that the front door is guarded and that even when new threats emerge, Cloudflare will be ahead of the game in terms of security and its software. We have a significant amount of trust in Cloudflare as a partner,\" Laferriere concludes.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Fast-growing cloud infrastructure company D2iQ combats spear phishing__\n\nD2iQ makes it easier to build and run Kubernetes at scale, and helps companies simplify and scale their IT operations through a carefully integrated and automated containerized platform. The company values fast, flexible deployment and operational simplicity. Those same values informed their search for the right vendor to protect their organization from targeted cyberattacks and theft of valuable intellectual property (IP). \n\nD2iQ hosts its email on Google's cloud platform. Although Google takes care of high-volume spam, D2iQ found that low-volume targeted phishing emails were still sneaking by, leaving their organization at risk. Before Cloudflare, more than 100 phishing messages per week were evading their existing filters and reaching inboxes. D2iQ was concerned about their high exposure to phishing messages. Cloudflare's email security solution was able to provide D2iQ with a best-in-class targeted phishing service that improved the company's Google Cloud security posture.\n\n### __Challenge__\n\nIn today's landscape, many businesses deal with the growing pains associated with rapid expansion. During high-speed growth, it can be difficult to apply strict security to all areas of vulnerability, particularly those that require human vigilance. \n\nD2iQ wanted to understand the extent of its exposure to phishing attacks. After performing a phishing simulation at the company that targeted approximately 106 employees in all functions and at all levels, 76% of the targeted employees clicked on the phishing email - a total of 117 clicks.\n\nThis phishing simulation was eye-opening. Even with awareness and education programs, the best results could only reduce those rates, not put an end to them. D2iQ decided to employ a security solution that would take the onus of protection off its employees and that would work in conjunction with its current messaging solution.\n\n### __Solution__\n\nBecause it offered seamless integration with their existing infrastructure and required little to no additional resources to operate, Cloudflare was the perfect fit to protect D2iQ from targeted phishing attacks.\n\nTogether with Google Suite, Cloudflare email security provides D2iQ with comprehensive email protection. Google filters out spam and commodity threats, while Cloudflare hones in on the targeted phishing emails, detecting and dropping extremely low volume, targeted phishing messages. With this protection in place, D2iQ doesn't have to rely on its end users to spot and thwart devious attacks. Cloudflare helps D2iQ stay efficient, automated, and integrated in its security practices, keeping operations agile, and aligning with their core values.\n\nWhile the task of outsourcing cybersecurity efforts can seem complicated and mysterious, especially to businesses without large security teams, the Cloudflare email security solution helps companies secure their inboxes by providing a single, simple, cloud-native service. \n\n\"The reason we chose Cloudflare is because of its sophistication in addressing phishing attacks and its high level of communication with its customers,\" said Tobi Knaup, D2iQ co-founder and CEO.\n\nRight away, Cloudflare email security stopped more than 21,000 phishing attacks out of a total volume of more than 10 million messages received. While seemingly small — just 0.2% of overall message traffic — this number represents upwards of 90% of potential breaches. \n\nHyper-focused on custom-targeted, one-of-a-kind phishing attacks, Cloudflare ensures true inbox safety for its customers. Cloudflare arms D2iQ with full-coverage email protection using one simple integration, keeping the company quick, nimble, and secure. \n",

JCB is the only international credit card brand in Japan with over 140 million members and approximately 39 million merchants (as of March 2022). They handle all kinds of operations related to card payments, including card issuance and merchant acquisition. In recent years, they have been actively developing advanced services, such as diversification of payment schemes, contactless rechargeable prepaid card payments, mobile apps and biometric authentication. Their highly visited website gets over 20 million page views each month. \n\n### __Rising costs for rapid increases in traffic and online threats__\n\nJCB had previously used another CDN provider, but the service and pricing were not satisfactory. The JCB website was experiencing rapid increases in traffic during specific periods, such as during marketing campaigns, which resulted in high operational fees as pricing was determined by the number of page views. On top of that, in order to keep the website reliable and secure, JCB had to deploy web security solutions, such as DDoS mitigation, to protect against online threats.\n\n### __Cloudflare's features and pricing are the best match for JCB__\n\nThe establishment of Cloudflare's Japan office in July 2020 was also a critical factor in Cloudflare being selected by JCB. \n\nMr. Rei Kakinuma, Assistant Vice President, Digital Solutions Development Department at JCB Co.,Ltd. explains the reasoning behind their decision to migrate to Cloudflare, \"We believe that using Cloudflare would not only keep our costs down, but it is also feature-rich and highly performant. On top of that, Cloudflare is renowned for web security & DDoS attack mitigation mechanisms and it is one of the top services in the industry.\" \n\nTo JCB's delight, their analytics revealed that by using Cloudflare Argo Smart Routing, which routes web traffic across the fastest and most reliable network paths, it resulted in a 65% faster web response time. \n\n### __DigiCert and Cloudflare teamed up to support migration__\n\nAs a Cloudflare partner, DigiCert played a critical role in JCB's migration to Cloudflare. Mr. Kakinuma reflects, \"For JCB, one of the biggest advantages was being able to discuss the technology in-depth with our main contact at DigiCert. We felt reassured and benefited from receiving prompt and reliable support from Cloudflare's technicians.\" \n\n### __Looking forward to additional Cloudflare features and innovations__\n\nWhen JCB first started using Cloudflare, the focus was on CDN and DDoS protection. As JCB continues to expand, they look to add on WAF and other services. Mr. Kakinuma explains, \"Shortly after the Log4j vulnerability was announced to the public, I saw an email from Cloudflare saying, 'It's been dealt with.' That was an example that with Cloudflare, it is now possible for JCB to fully focus our resources on our business instead of spending time concerned about security measures.\" \n\nMr. Kakinuma is excited about Cloudflare's product roadmap and innovation velocity. JCB intends to continue exploring and extending how they use Cloudflare as the company continues to grow.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __West Ham United FC uses Cloudflare to provide supporters with a secure and highly responsive match-day web experience__\n\nBased at East London's London Stadium, West Ham United Football Club has been an enduring fixture in English football for well over one hundred years.  \n\nThe club enjoys the [English Premier League's third-highest average matchday attendance](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268576/clubs-of-the-english-premier-league-by-average-attendance) — around 58,000 supporters per game — and has a strong international support base who depend on the West Ham United website for game updates. Every match brings up to a 10x spike in visitor traffic, driven in part by the club's massive social media following, and by a Premier League blackout on televising Saturday matches in the UK after three pm. \n\n\"Match days and the buildup to games are when the fans turn to the site for news. It is a platform for the club's manager to explain the strategy, player formations, and injuries of the day,\" explains Richard Ravenhill, Technical Director at Skye Cloud, a West Ham sponsor and the club's official private server and networking provider. \"Throughout the game, the site provides West Ham fans with real-time updates of what's going on — explaining fouls and cards, updating scores, and more.\"\n\n### __Challenge: Keeping West Ham supporters worldwide up to date by maintaining performant website access during traffic surges of 10x__\n\nUnfortunately, West Ham's incumbent cloud service partner and legacy website weren't up to providing the security, reliability, and performance the club needed during these matchday traffic spikes. The club experienced frequent website outages, causing impatient fans to seek news and fan merchandise elsewhere.   \n\n\"West Ham supporters are a passionate bunch, they don't wait for a slow page to load. They want information in real time so they can keep up with match day news,\" explains Ravenhill. \"The website is also a hub for the club's revenue-generating activities — its YouTube videos and the official sites for West Ham tickets, merchandise, and memorabilia. If the fans can't get to those portals, they can't support the club financially — which is obviously bad news.\"\n\nIn addition, the club needed to maintain strong web performance during volatile off-season transfer windows.\n\n\"During the summer transfer window, when the marquee player trades and signings happen, there is a lot of media buzz around the West Ham lineup,\" says James Bishop, Skye Cloud's Director. \"West Ham supporters check the site regularly to confirm or dispel rumors about who is joining the club and who will be going.\"    \n\nPerformance and reliability weren't West Ham's sole focus. Proactively ensuring the security of its website, mobile apps, and fan base was another key priority. \n\n\"As a Premier League club, we are a target that is constantly under threat,\" says Mo Ali, the West Ham United Director of IT, referring to malicious attacks other Premier League football clubs have suffered in the past. \n\n\"The Internet is full of bad actors that target high-profile sites. While we have been safe so far, we need to stay one step ahead to protect the brand,\" Ali adds.\n\n### __Solution: A West Ham Win — The Skye Cloud-Cloudflare collaboration for enhanced website performance and security__\n\nAfter a 2021 performance and security review of its website and web host, West Ham was ready for change. That change took the form of Skye Cloud, the bespoke cloud and private UK hosting provider. In addition to an excellent reputation, Skye Cloud had a strong personal connection to the club. \n\n\"Skye Cloud provided us with information about best practices, how we should use our infrastructure, and the vendors that we should partner with to provide the best web experience to our supporters,\" says Ali. \"Based on those recommendations, we chose them as an official sponsor and business partner.\"\n\nOne of Skye Cloud's first actions was to switch West Ham onto the Cloudflare Global Network to improve the core security of its website and mobile applications.\n\n\"We wanted to be sure West Ham had proper security in place from day one. We wanted a partner that we knew could deliver and that's where Cloudflare came in,\" says Ravenhill.\n\nThe West Ham migration to Skye Cloud included implementing Cloudflare DNS services, the Web Application Firewall (WAF), and page rules to filter and redirect traffic. In addition, Skye adopted Cloudflare DDoS mitigation — a proactive measure the club has not yet needed but is important to strengthen its security posture.  \n\n### __Providing a solid defense against downtime with Cloudflare__\n\nWith Cloudflare security in place, Skye Cloud focused on enhancing the West Ham site's match-day performance. Skye Cloud relies on the Cloudflare Global Content Delivery Network (CDN) to handle the club's peak traffic loads.\n\n\"The Cloudflare network delivers all web content to the West Ham fan base,\" says Ali. \"Because we can offload that traffic, Cloudflare radically reduces the number of hits we take, — in one 24-hour match day peak, the West Ham site received 11.5 million requests. Cloudflare handled over 93% of them.\" \n\nBecause Cloudflare handles the club's web traffic so efficiently, Skye Cloud can pass their savings on to West Ham as reduced hosting fees. \n\nFor the club and its sponsor, the benefits of the relationship with Cloudflare are clear. West Ham and Skye Cloud plan to continue the partnership for the foreseeable future, expanding into other Cloudflare products like Zero Trust as their fan base and infrastructure develop.  \n\n\"100% uptime speaks volumes as a testament to the Cloudflare, Skye Cloud, and West Ham collaboration. There isn't a better statistic to describe the results,\" says Ravenhill. \"Cloudflare just works. They are a partner you can trust. A partner that responds when you need them and provides you with insights into product development, training, and a product you can rely on.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps AsiaBill deliver a fast and safe payment experience for independent sellers__\nFounded in 2015, AsiaBill is headquartered in Hong Kong Science Park. Their business includes international credit card transaction processing and a payment gateway service across borders for independent stores. In 2018, AsiaBill launched a Shopify transaction processing service as Shopify's official payment service provider worldwide.\n\n### __Challenge: Manage risks and provide a safe & easy payment service for sellers__\nCompared to other third-party payment tools, AsiaBill's key advantage is its excellent risk management. With a comprehensive fraud monitoring system that monitors and analyzes login devices, shopping behavior, account changes, and more, it  identifies most risk signals and fully safeguards payment.\n\nIn addition to excellent risk control, speed is also critical for payment services. Since AsiaBill servers are located in Hong Kong, they could not guarantee a quick payment experience for buyers around the world. AsiaBill noticed an unusually high cart abandonment rate on some independent sites: some consumers were canceling the transaction on the final payment page.\n\nTian Jun, Technical Director at AsiaBill, explained, \"We guessed that consumers in some countries or regions might have a slow response when accessing the payment page, so the users lose patience and give up on payments.\" Therefore, AsiaBill started looking for a solution to improve response times. They tried a free version of the Cloudflare CDN service to see if this could help improve the issue.\n\n### __Cloudflare makes the payment process smooth and reduces the cart abandonment rate__\nAsiaBill's self-developed monitoring system can record and analyze every step of the consumer journey, including time spent between starting and finishing payment. \"After our comparison test, the overall loading speed of the payment page is greatly improved after using Cloudflare,\" said Tian Jun.\n\nAsiaBill was so pleased with the improvement from Cloudflare that they decided to become an Enterprise customer. They added Argo Smart Routing to their plan to further optimize the payment experience.\n\nWith the Cloudflare global network, which is spread out across more than %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world, AsiaBill is able to cache static content in a location closer to consumers. And with Argo Smart Routing, dynamic content is delivered over the fastest and most reliable dedicated backbone links. The result is a seamless payment experience for consumers wherever they are in the world.\n\n\"In addition to significant acceleration in Europe and the United States, the performance in some smaller countries, such as Tanzania, Algeria, and Morocco, is also much improved.\" said Tian Jun, \"Previously it took 8 seconds to complete page loading, but after using the Cloudflare Global Network, it only takes 3 seconds, an improvement of 62.5%.\" \n\nThanks to Cloudflare, AsiaBill has not only improved the consumer shopping experience, but also reduced the cart abandonment rate of independent sites. Tian Jun said, \"After activating Cloudflare, the overall order abandonment rate for the independent site platform has been reduced by up to 20%.\"\n\nWith these challenges solved, AsiaBill's labor costs have also been reduced. Tian Jun said, \"After solving the unusual order abandonment issue, we also saved a lot on labor costs, especially communication costs. It made communication between the sales department and the technical department easier. After our optimization, we have not received any abnormal cart abandonment feedback from sales.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Werner Enterprises moved its legacy applications to the cloud, protected its users from email-borne threats, and consolidated its network security with Cloudflare",
						"longDescription": "## __Driving innovation — Werner Enterprises works with Cloudflare to consolidate email, app, and network security solutions__\n\nWerner Enterprises has been hauling cargo across North America since it purchased its first truck in 1956. Since then, the company has grown into one of the USA's largest truckload cargo carriers. Today, it is at the center of a connected alliance of world-class supply chain solutions. \n\nThe company uses best-in-class technology to improve its services, and its internal applications are central to that business strategy, providing Werner customers with optimized freight management services and its resources on the road with 24/7 access to trip details, load statuses, and reference documentation.  \n\n### __Challenge: Migrating critical legacy systems and detecting sophisticated email borne-threats with consolidated Cloudflare security__  \n\nDue to the size and geographical diversity of its workforce, as well as its widespread use of email for internal and customer communications, Werner had concerns about phishing — the use of socially engineered emails to extract sensitive information from unsuspecting employees. With email-borne threats increasing in both frequency and sophistication, the company's previous email security system wasn't keeping up.   \n\n\"Nine out of ten security breaches begin with a phish — so every malicious email that hits a user's inbox is a threat to our business,\" explains Michael Perdunn, Director of Cyber Security at Werner Enterprises. \"As a critical US infrastructure provider, we are always one click away from being compromised. Without a strong email security posture, potential attackers can target our employees to gain a foothold within the company.\" \n\nIn addition to its email security concerns, Werner was also systematically migrating its legacy on-premise applications to the cloud so its North American resources could work free of the limitations of a traditional VPN. \n\nMaintaining the availability of these core systems during the transition to the cloud was critical, as was protecting its customers' commercial history and its employees' personally identifiable information (PII). The company was also looking to minimize tool sprawl and reduce the complexity of managing multiple vendor security solutions.\n\n\"We are modernizing our entire technology stack from the ground up. We're building a scalable cloud- and API-based system,\" explains Danny Lilley, Werner Enterprises Vice President and Chief Technical Officer.\n\n\"During COVID-19, we realized it made no sense to bring everything back on site via our VPN,\" adds Perdunn. \"Instead, we wanted a unified set of tools that would take us into the cloud to mitigate threats, improve performance, and provide our clients and users with the same security they would have if they were actually in the building.\"  \n\n### __Stopping phishing and BEC attacks with Cloudflare Area 1 email security__\n\nThe Werner security engineering team turned to Cloudflare. With Cloudflare email security, the company secured its [Microsoft 365](https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/microsoft-365/) inboxes, improved protection for its mobile and roaming users, and implemented a more proactive approach to email security. As an [integrated cloud email security solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/email-security-services/), Cloudflare's email security solution uses AI, machine learning, and computer vision technologies to provide comprehensive, effective phishing protection. \n\nCloudflare preemptively scans the Internet for attacker infrastructures. It identifies the sources and delivery mechanisms of phishing and [business email compromise (BEC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) attacks before they can launch. Cloudflare email security also provides end-to-end inbox protection against malicious URLs and payloads like malware or ransomware that can bring down networks. \n\nBecause it is cloud-native and offers multiple [deployment options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-security/deployment/) that integrate neatly into any enterprise email solution, Cloudflare satisfied the Werner Security engineering team's ease of use requirement with near-instantaneous deployment.\n\n\"Many solutions make promises about their capabilities, but Cloudflare email security really was easy to use and implement,\" says Perdunn. \"We very quickly got it running, integrated, and had the false positives worked out so we could begin protecting our users.\"\n\nCloudflare also met Werner's functional requirements by delivering clear business results for threat detection, security controls, and reporting. In the first 2-weeks, Cloudflare's email security solution identified  1,700 threatening emails that Werner's previous email security solution missed.\n\n\"The metrics we get from Cloudflare are fantastic. Where it really performs, though, is in the volume of threats it detects. Since we implemented, we have seen a 50% reduction in the number of malicious or suspicious emails our users receive every day. That frees up multiple hours we can reinvest into other goals,\" adds Perdunn, referring to strategic initiatives like researching the company's zero trust roadmap, further securing its technology stacks, and collaborating with technology partners to bring new value to the business.\n\n### __Seamlessly securing a hybrid on-premise/cloud infrastructure with Cloudflare Magic Transit__\n\nTo ensure security and uptime for its mix of legacy applications and on-premises hardware with its new cloud-based applications and servers, the Werner security and engineering teams also adopted Cloudflare Magic Transit and Magic Firewall. \n\nIn addition to [securing](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/) Werner's internal and external networks with the best-in-class Cloudflare network firewall and DDoS mitigation, Magic Transit and Magic Firewall give the Werner engineering team granular control over its traffic. From the Cloudflare dashboard, the Werner teams can easily balance system performance and security, and provide consistent offsite availability, while reining in overheads associated with operating in the cloud.   \n\n\"Magic Transit manages our connection to Azure and maintains the flow of information between our users, cloud tenants, and the systems we have on-premise. With Cloudflare we have complete control of our data centers and everything we move out to our cloud providers flows as effectively and efficiently as possible,\" says Perdunn. \"Everything critical to our organization is always available and running as it should.\" \n\nBecause both Cloudflare email security and Magic Transit are a part of the consolidated Cloudflare solution, Werner has also reduced the complexity of maintaining and upgrading its network infrastructure while gaining greater insight into its own data. \n\n\"Cloudflare helps my teams get at the data and the truth without having to pivot between tools,\" says Perdunn. \"By consolidating our security under Cloudflare, we can automate and move much faster than a potential attacker. It is that ease-of-use, security, tight integration, and Cloudflare reliability that multiplies the efficiency of my security teams and delivers the most business value.\"   \n\nReflecting on the impact Magic Transit has had on the Werner infrastructure, Lilley adds, \"As we roll out Cloudflare and consolidate into a single platform, our security stack is stronger than ever before.\"\n\nCloudflare has helped to accelerate Werner's migration to the cloud, improved its [application security](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/), and protect its users and networks from malicious emails. Ultimately, however, it is the two companies' similar culture and shared focus on innovation that has Werner investigating [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/) and planning to integrate additional Cloudflare services as part of its roadmap for 2023. \n\n\"Cloudflare understands what we do and where we are on our journey. It is one of our core providers because we need a vendor that provides solutions as quickly as we encounter new challenges,\" says Perdunn. \"As we continue to grow through acquisition, we plan to extend the Cloudflare security umbrella throughout our entire organization.\"\n\n\"We're trying to use a single vendor as much as possible, and so far we've liked everything Cloudflare has sent our way. Cloudflare cares about its customers, about us — it just feels like a good fit,\" adds Mahon.\n",

Megalayer provides Internet services, IDC services, server leasing, and more. Their data centers are available in several regions, including Japan, Korea, USA, HK (China), Singapore, and the Philippines.\n\n### __Challenge: Provide quality and stable network services for customers going abroad__\nExpanding abroad, especially for Chinese Internet companies, is a way to explore new growth opportunities, especially in the fast-paced era of digital transformation. Megalayer was established to provide Chinese companies expanding abroad with more convenient and efficient value-added telecom services. Currently, Megalayer's users are concentrated in China and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe difference between Megalayer and other telecom value-added service providers is its sophisticated and fast-action professional services. Regardless of customer needs, from general resources to line quality to protection issues, Megalayer can respond within 72 hours and ensure their customers' business is unaffected by any technical gaps.\n\nSince its establishment, the biggest headache for Megalayer has been attacks. For example, a massive attack brought down its data center, causing massive network packet losses and network outages. These cases can sometimes result inexperience,  network performance, and even customer churn. \"The most serious attack occurred during the 2020 May Day holiday where we suffered non-stop attacks for seven days,\" Megalayer's CTO Zhu Ling said. \"All resources in our server room were unavailable for those seven days.\"\n\nTo prevent problems like this from happening again, Megalayer had been looking for a suitable security application provider. They tested different DDoS mitigation products, but were not satisfied until they found Cloudflare in May of 2022.\n\n### __Magic Transit Defends Megalayer Against Large-Scale Attacks and Reduces O&M Costs__\nAfter careful consideration, Megalayer adopted Cloudflare Magic Transit, which [protects network infrastructure](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/) from DDoS attacks.\nIn past attacks, Megalayer used an extreme solution: removing the IP route under attack and gradually restoring it later on. With Magic Transit, as soon as an attack occurs, Megalayer quickly switches the route to Cloudflare, and Cloudflare's Magic Transit steps in to block the attack. With over 155 Tbps network capacity and near-instant mitigation capability, Magic Transit can protect the entire IP subnet from DDoS attacks. \n\n\"During the week of August 22-28, Magic Transit blocked 4,027 malicious attacks for us,\" added Zhu Ling. The attacks were mainly TCP, UDP, and ICMP flooding attacks, peaking at 13 Gbps, which were all successfully detected and mitigated by Cloudflare.\n\nUnder Cloudflare's protection, the network availability and accessibility of Megalayer increased by nearly 100% – even when subjected to another large-scale attack. Zhu Ling said, \"With Magic Transit, the network outage has been completely resolved. Our customers' businesses run stably, even during prolonged and large-scale network attacks. This significantly improved the network quality of server rooms.\" \n\nIn addition to guaranteeing network quality, Cloudflare reduces work pressure and costs for the Operations team at Megalayer. The team can devote their time to more important tasks because there is no longer a need to constantly deal with network attack sources and monitor network resources. Now, with network quality improved, customers' issue reports have become less common, reducing operational pressures on the maintenance team. With Cloudflare Magic Transit, network maintenance work is reduced by 60% when facing large-scale attacks and overall network maintenance costs were  reduced by 50%.\n\nIn just three months, Magic Transit has shown Megalayer the strength of Cloudflare's products and the professional competence of their team. Zhu Ling said, \"The communication was smooth. And the whole configuration process was quite smooth, too. Magic Transit allowed our resources to operate normally, even when under attack. The DDoS protection is very reliable.\" \n",

However, they were also concerned about their Microsoft 365 email users being vulnerable to sophisticated phishing attacks. As a company that provides a single platform to manage people, locations, assets, and work across multiple industries, email is a critical communications tool. \n\n### __Challenge__<br>\nNuvolo discovered that threats were slipping past Microsoft 365 and its existing email security infrastructure, which led to the IT team constantly tuning its email security blocklists. \n\nNuvolo turned to Cloudflare Cloud Security to prevent threats from slipping past its security infrastructure and Microsoft's native defenses, and to also save IT time and resources.\n\n### __Solution__<br>\nThe company chose Cloudflare because of its unique approach to preemptively stopping Business Email Compromise, malware, and other advanced threats. Threats are discovered and eliminated  before they reach any Nuvolo inboxes. This, in turn, means the IT team can spend less time and reosurces on tuning email security blocklists, and more time on other company priorities. \n\n### __Results__<br>\nCloudflare, which was simple and fast for Nuvolo to deploy, is now operational firm-wide, with immediate results. For example, in just one month, Cloudflare blocked more than 45,000 phishing messages. \n\n\"I'm impressed by the ease of setup and zero service interruption for my team. I did not have to push any changes or software to any systems, and best of all Cloudflare covers our users on any device,\" says Jason Siegrist, Chief Information Security Office at Nuvolo. \n\nAlso, the IT team no longer needs to tune email security rules and provide better security metrics and reporting. Siegrist notes, \"Cloudflare is super easy to set up, and works like a CHAMP! I do not have to push any changes or software to any systems.\" \n\nLike all things in security, it is important to have layers of protection. This tool has allowed Nuvolo to filter out many messages which were missed by other tools, and allows for the easy alerting of IT to quickly investigate and remediate phishing emails from end-to-end.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare security solutions protect the Republic of Estonia's digital economy from cyber threats__\n\nIn the 1990s, policymakers in the Republic of Estonia laid the groundwork for building a new technology infrastructure from scratch. The IT strategy called for creating low-cost, cutting-edge systems based around accessibility and efficiency. \n\nThe result: Today's Estonia is a digital society. It's the first country to move its IT infrastructure into the cloud, with critical databases and services backed up in a high-security data center in Luxembourg. Citizens can vote, sign documents, pay parking fees and taxes, order prescriptions, and more from their smartphones and computers.\n\nDigital services make life easier for citizens while also making more efficient use of taxpayer money. But in a digital society, robust security is vital to protecting personal data and the many digital services people rely on. CERT Estonia, the cyber security branch of Estonia's Information System Authority, has implemented Cloudflare solutions not only to harden its security posture but also to maintain strict compliance with regulations and standards for data privacy and protection.\n\n### __Challenge: Thwart malicious attacks and achieve compliance with government and industry regulations__\n\nIn 2021, organizations around the world experienced an unprecedented increase in new vulnerability exploits, ransomware, phishing, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. CERT Estonia registered twice as many DDoS attacks in 2021 versus 2020, and received 20% more reports of fraud affecting businesses and individuals. \n\nIn response, the CERT team aggressively implemented tools and resources to strengthen its security posture. These efforts have accelerated threat identification and response. Cloudflare application security products play a major role in the CERT security strategy:\n\n- Cloudflare DDoS services protect web services, applications and network infrastructure\n- Cloudflare Bot Management manages good and bad bots in real time\n- Cloudflare Rate Limiting enables the team to establish rules that prevent requests from overloading a server\n\nThe team has also begun implementing the Cloudflare Data Localization Suite (DLS) to handle expectations and requirements for keeping certain data within the borders of Estonia or the European Union.\n\n### __Mitigating DDoS attacks, bot attacks, and excessive server traffic__\n\nWith the increase in attacks of all types, the CERT team began investigating and testing various security solutions. The team found that Cloudflare excelled in its ability to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks, malicious bot intrusions, and traffic overload on servers.\n\nCloudflare DDoS protection addresses the rising number of DDoS attacks, protecting Estonia's web services, applications, and network. \"DDoS protection was easy to set up,\" notes Tõnu Tammer, Director of CERT Estonia. \"And we now have significantly stronger protection against random scanning, software vulnerabilities, and so forth.\" \n\nBecause not every bot is bad, the CERT team seeks to manage bots in a way that does not interfere with good bots. Cloudflare Bot Management uses machine learning and behavioral analysis to recognize requests that are likely coming from bots. It creates and maintains a list of acceptable bots to ensure that requests from them pass through. By blocking bad bot traffic, Cloudflare Bot Management ensures that the Information System Authority's backend systems are available for efficiently handling valid traffic.\n\nCloudflare Advanced Rate Limiting employs a rules-based approach to stop requests from overloading a server. The solution is a leap forward in throttling technology. It counts requests based on virtually any characteristics of the HTTP request, regardless of its source IP, providing a strong defense against brute force, scraping, and targeted DDoS attacks. \n\n\"What is especially good about Cloudflare's approach is that we can layer the DDoS, Bot Management, and Rate Limiting tools with complementary rules to protect more fully against malicious traffic,\" Tammer says. \"The tools work together to quickly identify threats and apply rate limiting to keep traffic to servers at a manageable level.\"\n\n### __Realizing quantifiable results__\n\nSince implementing the Cloudflare solutions, the CERT team has dramatically improved its ability to block threats. For example, Cloudflare blocked 384 million threats in a single 30-day period. The solutions are also enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. The team reports a bandwidth and data egress cost savings of 75% in a 30-day period. \n\n### __Ensuring compliance with the GDPR and adherence to standards__\n\nLike all EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries, Estonia must ensure that its IT systems comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR requires that the processing and storage of personal information must occur within the borders of EU and EEA countries.\n\nCloudflare's network is private and compliant by design, maintaining ISO 27001 certification. The Cloudflare Data Localization Suite enables Cloudflare to extend the same rigorous level of privacy into application data.  \n\nTammer says that a major advantage of Cloudflare is its physical presence in Estonia. Most Information System Authority services run within Estonia as well. The implementation of DLS with Cloudflare Spectrum, a reverse proxy product that extends the benefits of Cloudflare to all TCP/UDP applications, reduces the risks associated with connecting to the public internet. \"The Spectrum default configuration on our IPs ensures that data processing takes place inside the European Union,\" Tammer remarks. CERT is the first customer to use Spectrum static IPs.\n\nThe CERT team is impressed with Cloudflare's adherence to standards and timely adaptation to emerging standards. Cloudflare supports the current Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 standard and will offer support for [post-quantum cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/) standards as they are finalized in the future. \n\n\"New privacy standards are designed with greater security in mind. Cloudflare is committed to adopting these standards with products like the Data Localization Suite. We benefit from this constantly improving security without any impact to our performance or availability,\" said Tammer.\n\n### __CERT Estonia is ready for the continued onslaught of threats in the years ahead__\n\nThe security team at CERT Estonia is realistic about the future. Cyber threats are not going away — instead, they will constantly increase in volume and sophistication. \n\nWith Cloudflare, however, Estonia's Information System Authority is fully prepared for vulnerability exploits (like those directed at the Log4j logging application), the growing number of DDoS attacks, phishing attacks, and other threats. Moreover, team members are confident that the partnership with Cloudflare will empower them to stay ahead of criminal groups and individual attackers who target Estonian citizens, businesses, and government agencies. \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Divio improves application availability and creates new service offerings with Cloudflare__\n\nFounded in 2006, [Divio](https://www.divio.com/) offers a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution that makes it easier for developers to deploy and manage hosted applications. Divio is headquartered in Stockholm with satellite offices in Zurich and New York.  By helping to manage partnerships and developing efficient and effective automated architectures, Divio helps customers meet and exceed their performance, security, and compliance goals for their cloud-based applications. \n\n### __Challenge: Automating and simplifying cloud management processes__\n\nDivio's goal is to allow customers to make the most of their cloud investments. Cloud management can be difficult as cloud users need to cope with multiple environments that differ significantly from the on-prem deployments that they are accustomed to. Divio's smart PaaS is designed to make it as simple as possible by eliminating or streamlining complex processes and focusing on automating tasks and workflows.\n\nHowever, while Divio had the tools and expertise to manage problems and automate processes within cloud environments, other processes required time-consuming manual efforts or involved unavoidable downtime or delays. For example, provisioning customer SSL certificates and migrating infrastructure between cloud zones were both manual, labor-intensive processes that consumed customer support resources and resulted in downtime.\n\n### __Automated certificate management improves efficiency and security__\n\nDivio manages its customers' digital certificates, but, previously, this was a complex and time-consuming process. The average customer has many applications and subdomains, so configuring and deploying all the required digital certificates took significant time and effort.\n\nWith Cloudflare for SaaS, the certificate management process is automated, taking the burden off of Divio's team. Handing certificate management off to Cloudflare also provided other benefits for Divio and its customers. According to Jonathan Stoppani, Divio's CTO, \"The advantage that Cloudflare for SaaS gives us is that we are immediately able to take advantage of all of Cloudflare's features without additional configuration. Once we use Cloudflare for SaaS, we have all of Cloudflare's [application security solutions](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) in front of our applications right away.\"\n\nOccasionally, Divio customers will find that their websites are suffering micro-outages that hurt availability and performance. Divio support personnel often find these issues are caused by sudden bursts of requests, web-crawling bots, and similar attacks.\n\nCustomers that agree to provision Cloudflare in front of their application often find these issues disappear, improving site performance and customer experience. Since Cloudflare blocks these attacks, it also eliminates the need for Divio personnel to investigate and remediate the issue, freeing them up to assist customers in other ways.\n\n### __Taking full advantage of cloud flexibility while minimizing downtime__\n\nDivio also offers customers the ability to change where their applications are hosted within a cloud provider's region or across different cloud providers using [Cloudshift](https://www.divio.com/cloudshift/). For example, a customer might want to shift infrastructure hosted on US-based servers and data locations to European ones to improve network latency and application performance for their customers.\n\nIn the past, making a switch required significant coordination between teams and created downtime as DNS record updates propagated. For systems using Cloudflare for SaaS, the DNS records point to Cloudflare, and routing is performed within the Cloudflare network. This enables Divio to completely automate the migration and cloud shift process, making it possible to migrate a customer's application in minutes and only a few clicks with zero downtime or customer interaction required.\n\nZero-downtime migrations are a major selling point for Divio's customers. According to Joel Burch, Divio's COO, \"Customers have asked us how much downtime they'd have when hosting their applications with the Divio platform protected by Cloudflare. It's really nice to be able to say, 'zero' thanks to Cloudflare.\"\n\nJonathan Stoppani has also found the support for zero-downtime migrations changes how customers manage their applications. He says, \"If a customer can transition their application to a new cloud infrastructure zone within hours or minutes with zero downtime, they start to use it differently. For example, if they have a trade show in a particular region, they might move their registration platform to that region to decrease latency.\"\n\nThis flexibility has a dramatic impact on the customer experience. However, it poses no availability, performance, or security risks because the customer's application can take advantage of Cloudflare network routing and security regardless of its location in the cloud.\n\n### __Simplifying and securing access to customer applications__\n\nTo serve its clients, Divio needs to be able to access its customers' applications and cloud environments to perform any requested changes to container orchestration, service management, and other settings. Since the average customer has five to ten applications across public, private, and hybrid cloud environments that Divio administrators need to access, managing authentication and account security can become complex.\n\nIn the past, Divio attempted to manually onboard and offboard each external, customer application onto its own single sign-on (SSO) platform — the same one used to manage access to Divio's internal apps. Each external and internal app required different configurations, authentication rules, and levels of support. Managing these different processes through the SSO platform made onboarding and offboarding employees and apps increasingly difficult. \n\nDivio deployed Cloudflare's [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/zero-trust-network-access/)) solution (Cloudflare Access) to streamline this manual access configuration process. With Cloudflare Access, Divio admins can now onboard employees and grant access more efficiently by managing and building policies for user groups instead of for individuals. Plus, Divio admins have automated the process of adding users to new applications — both internal and external — based on per-app authentication rules.\n\nCloudflare Access has not only simplified configuration, but also enabled more consistent security. Previously, Divio admins were limited by the ability of the diverse range of applications that they managed for customers to integrate with Divio's SSO system. Now, Divio sets all security policies including identity-based checks in the Cloudflare Access dashboard, and all users are required to authenticate via these rules before reaching applications. This unified workflow makes security enforcement more scalable and enhances admin visibility into user activity across applications.\n\n### __Meeting business needs and compliance requirements__\n\nDivio's customers need cloud infrastructure that offers performance and security, while facilitating their ability to meet compliance requirements. Cloudflare for SaaS and Access enable Divio to more efficiently provide high-quality cloud management services while meeting customers' security and compliance needs. According to Burch, \"Divio wants to be a one-stop shop for cloud management services as well as tools, and features for the application lifecycle through the Divio PaaS. [Integrating Cloudflare](https://www.divio.com/cloudflare-through-divio/), with its global network and application security portfolio, is essential to this and enhances our service portfolio Divio customers are benefitting from.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps Newborn Town Inc. create a fast and reliable social experience, serving over 1.3 billion users worldwide__\n\nFounded in 2009, Newborn Town has long focused on global open social networking, and has built a social product portfolio including Yumy, MICO and YoHo. The company has served over 1.3 billion users in more than 200 countries and regions. \n\n### __Challenge: Enhance localization operations, upgrade and develop better service performance and stability__\nFor audio and video social apps, content loading speed is closely related to user experience. And as one of the first Chinese Internet companies to expand overseas, Newborn Town faces diverse performance, stability and cost challenges across a wide variety of regions and local network conditions. \n\n\"As we expand our business on a global scale, the help of cloud vendors is indispensable. The most important thing for Newborn Town is service performance and stability.\" said Liu Mengpan, Head of Middle Platform at Newborn Town.   \n\n### __The Cloudflare global network and Argo Smart Routing accelerate traffic and save costs__\n\nTo resolve these performance, stability, and cost issues, Newborn Town partnered with Cloudflare. \n\n\"After all, we do overseas business, and our previous CDN costs were relatively high\", said Mengpan. \"One of our major reasons for choosing Cloudflare is that it provides a highly competitive price for outstanding products. Industry insiders are also no strangers to Cloudflare products.\"\n\nNewborn Town started using Cloudflare's CDN and Argo Smart Routing — the latter of which routes traffic over the fastest network paths — in April of 2022. Cloudflare's global anycast network spans more than 275 cities in over 100 countries and regions, ensuring fast audio and [video delivery](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/solutions/live-streaming/), shortening loading times, and reducing buffering. And in terms of cost, Argo Smart Routing and CDN minimize content requests to the origin, reducing Newborn Town's bandwidth usage and costs. Liu Mengpan said, \"Cloudflare has significantly enhanced our optimization. Our overall speed has increased by 14% after using CDN and 56% after using Argo Smart Routing, saving us 80% on costs, which is extremely cost-effective.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Advanced Certificate Manager is fully hosted, saving time and effort__\n\nIn addition to improved speed, Newborn Town also needs optimized SSL certificate management. For years, Newborn Town used paid certificates through third parties and tried free certificate management tools. But such certificate services are often only valid for a short period of time and require regular review by technical staff, resulting in high labor costs.\n\nTherefore,Newborn Town chose the highly flexible and customizable Advanced Certificate Manager from Cloudflare. Liu Mengpan said, \"With Cloudflare's Advanced Certificate Manager, we no longer need to go through frequent reviews, which saves us 30% on staff costs and gives us a price advantage compared to other paid certificate management services on the market, reducing overall costs by 35%.\"\n\nIn addition to creating better performance and cost savings, Newborn Town appreciates the professionalism and quick responses of Cloudflare's support teams. Newborn Town plans to further cooperate with Cloudflare to explore the possibilities for more products and services.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Fortune 500 telecommunications provider secures over 100,000 hybrid workers with Cloudflare__\n\nThis Fortune 500 telecommunications company has emerged as a global leader in Information, Communications, and Technology (ICT) solutions since its founding. Among its services, it powers many 5G networks around the world, and ranks as one of the primary providers for 5G network infrastructure. Today, the company operates worldwide and employs over 100,000 people across Europe, India, and the United States. \n\nOver the past few years, the company has incrementally adopted Zero Trust security across departments and regions. Modernizing how the company secures application and Internet access has been crucial in its efforts to shift controls from on-premise legacy environments to the cloud.\n\n### __Challenge__\n\nFollowing decades of technical innovation and growth, the company had developed a complex IT and security architecture that spanned over several hundred legacy applications. Maintaining on-premise infrastructure for a growing global enterprise was quickly becoming untenable, and the company started looking for ways to move to a more agile cloud environment.\n\nBut facilitating this process — while connecting and securing a massive, multi-continent workforce — presented a significant hurdle. Administrators juggled disparate security services, including several VPN configurations and Cisco Umbrella to protect users on the Internet with [DNS filtering](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dns-filtering/). This IT complexity was slowing down their ability to strengthen their security and implement Zero Trust best practices.\n\nRelying on Cisco Umbrella was particularly burdensome. Policies were difficult to tailor to specific user groups, basic network access required extensive administrative oversight, and the threat protection it offered left gaps across the company's architecture.\n\nUltimately, the company recognized that supporting its hybrid workforce and digital transformation ambitions would require gradually consolidating security onto a single cloud-based platform.\n\n### __Scaling access protections across departments and regions__\n\nThe company first adopted Cloudflare to secure application access back in 2018, when a developer group in the United States started a pay-as-you-go subscription with Cloudflare Access, a [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) ](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/)service, for about 200 users. This group found that Access delivered faster, safer access to developer environments — particularly for the occasional remote work — than its previous VPN setup.\n\nShortly before the pandemic in 2020, the company's centralized IT team in Europe began exploring opportunities across the wider organization to shift access controls to the cloud. Even before the pandemic forced remote work, the company was trying to think proactively about ways to deliver a more consistent user experience across regions and offloading traffic from its existing VPN appliances. \n\nFor an initial pilot, Cloudflare Access was selected to support Zero Trust access — first for 500 users, and later, 2,000. Although these users were based largely in a few northern European countries, Cloudflare appealed as a longer term partner for global adoption because of the breadth of its network, which today spans more than 275 cities in over 100 countries worldwide. \n\nOnboarding the company's Azure Active Directory onto Cloudflare was straightforward, and creating identity-based policies per application proved equally simple, enabling the company's administrators to focus less on configuration and more on security posture. Moreover, throughout the pilot, the company and Cloudflare collaborated closely on new capabilities, and the IT team was impressed by Cloudflare's ability to deliver its product roadmap with flexibility and speed.\n\n### __Investing in a single platform for application and Internet access__\n\nAs this initial pilot was winding down, the company saw an opportunity to consolidate controls for both application and Internet access with a single, cloud-based security platform.\n\nIn fall 2021, the company decided to invest in Cloudflare's [Zero Trust platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/) for its entire workforce. This allowed the company to address two strategic priorities at once:\n\n- Selecting a security partner to support the migration of applications from on-premise environments to AWS, Azure, and other cloud environments\n- Replacing Cisco Umbrella with simpler, more cost-efficient DNS filtering\n\nTo address the first goal, the company has progressively rolled out Cloudflare Access to thousands of additional users across multiple departments and regions, while simultaneously applying authentication controls in front of a wider variety of applications.\n\nUsing the same management interface that Access provides, the company is now able to build policies around DNS filtering, which is delivered through Cloudflare's comprehensive [Secure Web Gateway](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/). Gateway not only offers robust DNS filtering, but also protects users and devices from unwanted and harmful content like ransomware, phishing, and other threats on the Internet. Here, the company can leverage the same device clients deployed to secure application access and the same integrations with identity providers (like Azure AD) to create user-based policies.\n\nCompared to Cisco Umbrella, the company's administrators appreciate that policy building is more straightforward and that Cloudflare's larger cloud network delivers faster and more consistent enforcement by being closer to its globally distributed users.\n\nBringing together security for application and Internet access is an important first step in this company's ambitions to modernize its IT architecture. Already, its collaboration with Cloudflare has proved valuable, as administrators no longer need to juggle multiple policy-building interfaces for disparate VPN and Internet filtering services. Plus, centralized logging simplifies SOC incident response and any compliance audits.\n\nAs it continues to shift away from on-premise environments, the company views simplifying security in the cloud with vendors like Cloudflare as essential to long-term excellence in its industry.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Fortune 500 retailer partners with Cloudflare to deliver a high-quality customer experience even during massive spikes in shopping activity__\n\nIn online retail sales, the quality of the customer experience separates winners from losers. But delivering an exceptional user experience isn't easy. Especially when the retailer participates in one of those Friday-at-midnight launches of Sony's newest PlayStation or Nike's limited-edition shoes. Those launches entice large numbers of consumers to sit at their computers and, precisely at 11:59 pm, begin hitting refresh repeatedly in hopes of snagging the highly coveted item. An exceptional customer experience is also critical on Black Friday when massive numbers of consumers can overwhelm a retailer's website as they start their holiday shopping.\n\nTo address these business events, a Fortune 500 retailer reached out for help in architecting a serverless solution capable of scaling instantly any time traffic spikes. But the company needed more than just scalability. It also needed to block bad actors who launch bot armies to scoop up inventory of sought-after items, making them unavailable to legitimate customers. \n\nThis Fortune 500 retailer got the help it needed from Cloudflare. Using Cloudflare solutions, the company built a custom queuing system. Specifically, it leveraged multiple components of the Cloudflare Developer Platform, a suite of compute, storage, and serverless tools to deploy code globally. \n\n### __Challenge: Assure maximum site performance and reliability when sales and promotions attract exceptionally high consumer and bot traffic__\n\nWhile one-off product releases were the initial motivation for implementing Cloudflare Developer Platform, the retailer was also looking ahead to Black Friday. For both situations, the company wanted to:\n\n - Create a fair and consistent way to process requests\n\n - Prevent bots from grabbing limited inventory, thereby preserving it for   customers\n\n - Protect the back-end infrastructure from overload at all times\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare Developer Platform to route requests from real customers appropriately while blocking bots__\n\nTo prepare for the Sony PlayStation® 5 release, the retailer needed a way to handle the expected traffic surge effectively so that the site wouldn't be overwhelmed. Working with the retailer, Cloudflare experts used Cloudflare Durable Objects to build a waiting room that logs and responds to requests in the order in which they are received. \n\nCloudflare Durable Objects provides strongly consistent storage for stateful applications. Instead of storing request data across all global network locations, a Durable Object runs from a single data center, ensuring that every request is handled fairly and consistently. So there's no possibility that two customers would be told they were next in line.\n\nTo prevent bots from getting into the waiting room, the team used the Cloudflare Workers serverless compute solution to create and deploy a script with routing logic that identifies bot traffic at the edge of the network and diverts it from the waiting room. The script uses a score calculated by bot management software for each request. The score indicates the probability that the request is coming from a bot. If the score indicates a probable bot, Workers diverts the request to a fake path. As a result, only legitimate traffic enters the waiting room. This process prevents bots from usurping queue positions from actual customers and purchasing limited inventory. \n\nThe solution stores the decisions and actions taken on each request, including answers to such questions as:\n\n  - Was the request flagged as a bot?\n\n  - Was the user admitted to the queue?\n\nThe team used Workers KV, Cloudflare's secure key-value storage, as a caching layer for the status of the requests. This low-latency solution tracks the actions taken on requests and rapidly delivers updates to all systems that need the information. \n\n### __Multiple product releases can run simultaneously with Cloudflare Workers__\n\nA sales event such as a new product release could be enough to topple a retailer's systems. However, creating a queuing system on the network edge with the Cloudflare network enabled this retailer to [keep its site running reliably](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) and meet customer performance expectations during popular launches. What's more, the retailer achieved this goal without a massive infrastructure investment or disruption to the experience of other shoppers. The serverless architecture provides coordinated storage, instant scale, and flexibility. \n\nMoreover, the retailer is now positioned to handle multiple queues concurrently and will be able to support multiple product launches at the same time. \n\nParticipating in a high-profile launch of a new smartphone, gaming console, or other high-demand item is stressful for retailers. However, these launches are an increasingly important part of the retail business. The moment of launch causes an instantaneous traffic spike. It also attracts malicious bots that try to scoop up coveted inventory. Keeping things running smoothly during these stressful events takes planning and foresight. Through its partnership with Cloudflare, this retailer is now able to keep the customer experience from degrading when limited-release items hit the market. The result is happier consumers who become long-term loyal customers.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Global media conglomerate responds to cyber threats and modernizes application access with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nA Forbes Global 2000 media and advertising company recently adopted Cloudflare to reimagine how it secured application access for its hybrid workforce. This company operates some of the most recognizable subsidiaries and brands in over 100 countries, employs tens of thousands people, and brings in billions in annual revenue.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the company faced urgent concerns about cyber threats and turned to Cloudflare to address vulnerabilities in how employees accessed internal applications. Within three months, the company deployed Cloudflare to adopt identity-aware Zero Trust best practices in front of hundreds of critical apps for nearly 50,000 users. \n\nThis swift rollout has not only mitigated attacks on the company's resources, but also has helped its administrators be more productive by offering a simpler approach to set access policies across its global workforce. \n\nThe company estimates that modernizing their security with Cloudflare Zero Trust across its entire organization can potentially reduce costs by over $5 million annually, thanks to time savings on IT administration, productivity gains for end users, lower spending on VPN and other legacy tooling, and the lower likelihood and reduced potential impacts of a data breach.\n\n### __Restoring business operations within 48 hours after a crisis__\n\nIn March 2022, the company decided to withdraw its operations from Russia following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Shortly thereafter, the company began experiencing attempts to attack its public websites and to compromise internal applications via its preexisting VPNs. Concerns about these threats — including becoming a target for state-backed actors — escalated to the point that the company shut down all web properties and several critical internal applications on a Sunday evening.\n\nCloudflare, in collaboration with a major implementation partner, initiated a rapid response. The first step was rolling out Cloudflare's L7 security services — including DDoS protection, WAF, and later Bot Management and Load Balancing — to mitigate threats directed at external websites. \n\nAs a next step, the company rolled out Cloudflare Access, a [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/) service, to secure a handful of critical web-based applications that had been most severely disrupted (including an ERP app used every day) for thousands of users. Deployment was particularly swift because the company did not need to roll out any device clients to user endpoints, taking advantage of Cloudflare's highly scalable reverse proxy motion.\n\nThe company integrated Cloudflare Access with its identity provider (Okta), enabling administrators to create identity-based authentication policies for each application. This approach equipped administrators with greater visibility and more granular controls across user groups than its previous architecture, which relied on a mix of VPN configurations that differed across subsidiaries.\n\nWithin 48 hours, the company was able to resume critical business operations. And within a few days, the company rolled out Cloudflare Access to several thousand additional employees.\n\n### __Scaling protections to 50,000 users__\n\nAfter reestablishing stable business operations, the company began to reconsider its longer term approach to securing access. Shifting access policy enforcement to a globally distributed cloud network offered an opportunity to deliver a more consistent experience for employees, who worked across many countries in both remote and in-office settings.\n\nOver the next few months, the company extended identity-based and group-based policies for hundreds more applications and thousands of users. By May 2022, nearly 50,000 users were using Cloudflare to authenticate to their most-used applications, offloading the majority of traffic from the company's existing VPNs. \n\n### __Unlocking productivity across the workforce__\n\nThis transition to a cloud-delivered Zero Trust model has helped IT and security teams be more productive. They are no longer managing disparate VPN configurations, and now have a single platform to manage policies across their global workforce. Plus, implementing default-deny, least-privilege best practices helps the company mitigate the risks from both insider and external threats. \n\nThese day-to-day productivity gains were meaningful factors in the company's estimated overall cost savings.\n\nIn particular, Cloudflare's seamless integration with Okta as an identity provider (IdP) helped save significant maintenance and configuration costs. Developers and IT administrators no longer had to worry about configuring SAML support for each individual self-hosted app to integrate with their IdP. Instead, enabling single sign-on (SSO) authentication required just a few clicks in the Cloudflare dashboard.  \n\nGoing forward, the company has ambitions to extend these Zero Trust protections across the entire global workforce, and to eventually retire its VPNs by putting Cloudflare in front of all its applications.\n",

						"longDescription": "__This video features Randy Potts, Chief Information Security Officer at Real Time Resolutions__\n\n## __Tell us about yourself and your company__\n\n__Randy Potts__: Hi, my name is Randolph Potts - Randy Potts. I am the CISO for a company called Real Time Resolutions. We are a Dallas-based full-servicing and debt collection company. We work for other financial institutions mostly. \n\nI personally have been in information security for a little over 17 years now, coming up on 18 years actually and started in this field really because I was working on satellite systems. The biggest issue I had is still an issue we have today. It's just people going to malicious websites, getting malicious things on their computers, causing uptime issues. And, so, you know, back then - 18 years ago - I became the security guy because I was monitoring network traffic trying to figure out kind of how to shift left. You know, move closer to where the incidents were starting and trying to prevent them. \n\nBack then it was people visiting malicious websites that they shouldn't be, downloading things they shouldn't. And today, the main way people get to those malicious things is by getting an email and then clicking the link that they shouldn't within that email, or opening an attachment that they shouldn't. So all of that is really critical. \n\n## __What email security challenges were you facing?__\n\n__Randy Potts:__ So I'd say the majority of our incidents today really stem from some sort of email making it to a user. They open the attachment...they click on a link. \n\nLike a lot of companies, we do phishing campaigns. We already had an email security gateway in place. We had a lot of layers of control, and so luckily we would catch these things when they made it through, but the whole idea was, 'what can we be doing to reduce the occurrence of these events?' So, we were looking at another layer to add that would reduce the number of phishing emails making it to our users.\n\n## __Why did you choose Cloudflare?__\n\n__Randy Potts:__ There are a lot of new email security solutions out there. So we were really looking at adding a layer in that email security stack. What made Cloudflare really stick out from the crowd is the false positive rate was impressively low, while still having a fairly low false negative rate as well. That, added to the research team that they have, being able to look into the emails that did make it through and make adjustments, make the overall system better, was really big for us. \n\nI know, I personally, I'm always just looking for really intelligent security practitioners that I can partner with. I'd say Cloudflare and the team over there are definitely best-in-class when it comes to email security. They did a really good job for us when it came to reducing the number of email that make it through and we have seen a significant decrease in the number of phishing emails that make it to users. That, combined with getting better user response and how we report the emails that do make it through...put us in a much better place where I feel like we are much less likely to suffer from a phishing campaign being successful against our organization. \n\n## __How did Cloudflare improve your security program?__ \n\n__Randy Potts:__ So Cloudflare has been incredibly beneficial to our team by removing the number of phishing emails that get through. Whenever something does make it through, our response procedures remove it from mailboxes, see if anyone clicked on the link. \n\nThere's a lot of investigation that goes into a single email making it through that could be malicious. And so with Cloudflare reducing the number of emails that are making it through, they have significantly reduced the amount of time we spend responding, investigating and cleaning up from these phishing emails. And they've really given the team back a lot where we can now focus on other improvements. I would say when we started this project, we were looking for a layer to add on to email security to respond to the phishing threats that we saw getting more advanced, more sophisticated. We were slowly seeing that increase in phishing campaigns against us. And now with Cloudflare that number is back down, it's below where we were prior to seeing this increase and our need to respond to these incidents has reduced drastically. \n\nSo overall, not only has Cloudflare helped us improve from an email security standpoint, they've also given us time back to go and improve other elements of our security programs. So, Cloudflare has done a lot to make our security program better here at Real Time Resolutions.\n\n## __What would you tell a colleague/peer about Cloudflare?__\n\n__Randy Potts:__ To any of my peers out there, I would definitely say you need to take a look at Cloudflare. They've helped us a lot and I think anyone who's trying to run a security program out there, especially if you have an issue with people clicking on things from emails, I would very much recommend that you look at Cloudflare. And I think you will see that it'll solve a lot of problems with email security along with any other layer you can throw in there. Definitely have a good endpoint EDR strategy as well for the things that might still make it through but, I would say Cloudflare is a basic initial step in getting that in there just to reduce the volume that you're seeing. And then that will let you go focus on that, on that EDR project, on those other projects that will bring value to you. I definitely think email and web security are just two of the biggest things you can do as far as reducing your user exposure. So, definitely go look at Cloudflare, you will not be disappointed.  ",

						"longDescription": "### How a global insurance services provider protects its Microsoft 365 users from advanced phishing threats \n\nThroughout its successful 150-year history, the confidential subject of this case study has always been committed to finding better ways to serve families and businesses who rely on them for financial peace of mind. \n\nIn an example of its commitment to innovation and growth and to modernize its business process, the company successfully implemented a hybrid architecture with both cloud and on-premises mailboxes. \n\nHowever, as technological advancement and industry continues to evolve, so does the increased risk of cyber attacks, leading to the risk of significant costs and damages. As a Fortune 50 global insurance provider that serves customers worldwide, a successful attack  could inflict major damage, including operational downtime.\n\n### Challenge \n\nRecognizing that their most significant cyber risk comes from email phishing threats, the security team wanted to better protect the company's inboxes, particularly in their hybrid environment.  \n\nAlthough the firm relied on content and reputation-based email and web security technology to protect it from phishing, the team still found itself frequently combating missed threats that escaped secure email gateway (SEG) detections. Furthermore, the team realized that traditional email security solutions built for on-premise mailboxes are ineffective in a hybrid IT environment. \n\n### Solution \n\nThe company chose Cloudflare email security to prevent phishing attacks, including adding the [Cloudflare PhishGuard](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/axa1NGVawaALL5LnuqBhA/5037517a2715c2c43062f01d3d32b83c/Cloudflare_Area_1_Solution_Brief_-_PhishGuard_JUN_2022.pdf) service for managed email security. Cloudflare's [email security solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/email-security-services/) is a cloud-native email security platform that preemptively and proactively crawls the web, discovering phishing campaigns and infrastructure vulnerabilities before targeted attacks such as [Business Email Compromise (BEC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) can reach inboxes. The resulting early insight and threat information from Cloudflare's anti-phishing service supplements their [Microsoft 365 security](https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/microsoft-365/) and traditional SEG to better detect and block missed threats.\n\nPhishGuard is an additional layer of security and automates fraud protection by providing dedicated resources for end-to-end phish and targeted attack management and response. PhishGuard provides customized notification, tailored threat hunting and personalized responses for fraud and insider threats.\n\n\"The Cloudflare PhishGuard service is a great way to augment standard email security controls. Threat hunting across our email environment and the extended Cloudflare customer base has led to the identification of some extremely well-crafted phishing attacks,\" says the global insurer's Messaging Manager. \n\nWith Cloudflare email security, the company was able to move beyond content and reputation-based detection, [prevent missed threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) by supplementing traditional SEG's with advanced phishing detection, and protect both cloud-based and on-premise mailboxes from attacks.\n\n### Results\n\nCloudflare email security is now operational company-wide, protecting the global insurance provider from email- and web-based phishing attacks. For example, in just one month, the Cloudflare service:\n\n- Stopped over 14,000 threats from reaching the organization's email inboxes\n- Supported the messaging team with critical security metrics and reports to share with internal stakeholders\n- Provided a seamless integration with the firm's existing email infrastructure with no maintenance issues \n\nIn fact, the PhishGuard service was  instrumental in saving the company from significant potential BEC-related financial losses totaling more than $1 million in 2021.\n\nCloudflare's preemptive, comprehensive, targeted phishing protection helped improve productivity and reduced cybersecurity risk.",

People are literally handing over the keys to a super expensive RV - there's a massive element of trust.\n\nMy name is Nathaniel Hill. I am the Director of Engineering at Outdoorsy. Outdoorsy is an online RV rental marketplace with the goal of reconnecting people with the outdoors.\n\nPrior to Cloudflare, Outdoorsy was repeatedly scraped by competitors and bad actors, and we found it extremely difficult to prevent. It's an unfortunate situation where we don't want to cause friction for our renters browsing our inventory, but we also don't want people to be able to download the entire inventory.\n\nAt Outdoorsy, since implementing Cloudflare Bot Management and WAF protection, we have been able to focus more on the customer and our product, and we spend far fewer engineering resources configuring and maintaining those.\n\nSince Outdoorsy has been using Cloudflare, we have 4x the size of our engineering team, but we actually spend less time now - I would say less than half of the time - configuring our security rules.\n\nPrior to Cloudflare, we did not have a strong security posture for our self-hosted resources. We began to realize it was only a matter of time before we had a data breach or an attacker was successful. And so we were looking for a solution to secure those resources.\n\nOutdoorsy has always been a digital native company. We've never had any on-premise servers. Adding a VPN would seem almost like going backwards. \n\nOur Access users are located all over the globe. They're all using Access for our self-hosted resources. Cloudflare Zero Trust has eased employee and contractor onboarding and made it much simpler to access our internal tooling. I would say that Cloudflare Zero Trust has made it at least 25 to 50% faster to grant access to our internal tooling to new team members and contractors.\n\nThe security landscape is difficult enough. I think that I feel like I have a fighting chance there with Cloudflare.",

						"shortDescription": "mogenius deploys Cloudflare to simplify network management for its fully automated cloud infrastructure platform",
						"longDescription": "## __mogenius eliminates cloud development pain points with help from Cloudflare__\n\nFounded in Germany, mogenius is a fully automated platform for deploying cloud-based applications that was born out of frustration with the complexity of cloud infrastructure management. The mogenius platform automates the process of configuring cloud infrastructure, including container management and certificate management.\n\nBy automating configuration and management, mogenius enables developers to focus on development rather than administrative tasks. Thousands of software developers around the world use the mogenius platform.\n\n### __Challenge: Automating security and network configuration management__\n\nmogenius' core focus and value proposition lie in automating every step of building and managing a hyper-scaling cloud infrastructure, including streamlining container management and DevOps workflows. However, to offer fully managed and automated management to customers, it also needs to manage configurations at security at the network level. This includes SSL certificate and DNS management and protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and web application attacks.\n\n### __Comprehensive security eliminates costly attacks__\n\nmogenius' customer applications use a variety of different protocols, making it complex to ensure consistent security and access control across the board. To address this issue, the company uses Cloudflare Spectrum's reverse proxy to offer improved performance and security to all TCP/UDP traffic.\n\nAccording to Lepsky, the protection that Cloudflare provides is essential to the customer experience. \"Even the smallest web application is targeted at some time by bots or attacks. We see this being taken care of in the Cloudflare dashboard, but the customer doesn't. They would never realize that they were under attack.\"\n\nBy automatically identifying and blocking these attacks, Cloudflare saves mogenius significant time and effort.  Benedikt Ilitisberger, Co-Founder and CTO at mogenius recalls, \"One Saturday morning, we suffered an attack by a botnet that put high pressure on some API servers. Without Cloudflare, this would have taken us a day or two to mitigate the attack and implement a good solution. Instead, we logged into Cloudflare, blocked the attack, and went back to breakfast.\"\n\n### __Automated DNS and certificate management simplifies application deployment and maintenance__\n\nWhen deploying a new application, a great deal of configuration is needed to move from a development environment to production. Some tedious but essential tasks include configuring SSL certificates and DNS records to ensure that customers can actually access and use the new application.\n\nWith Cloudflare, mogenius can automate the process of managing SSL certificates and DNS settings. According to Jan Lepsky, mogenius' CPO, \"SSL for SaaS allows us to actually deliver on our goals of automation and simplicity. The main value of SSL for SaaS is that customers just need to click a simple switch in the DNS settings, and everything just works, enabling developers to focus on their code.\"\n\nWithout Cloudflare, mogenius and its customers would spend much more time manually configuring SSL certificates and DNS settings. According to CEO Gerrit Schumann, SSL for SaaS saves customers thousands of days of work per year. Additionally, Cloudflare DNS eliminates the need for mogenius to operate a DNS server for its 56 DNS records and thousands of customer domains and URLs.\n\nIn addition to simplifying the configuration process, Cloudflare enables mogenius to simplify and automate the process of managing its customers' cloud infrastructure. According to Iltisberger, \"Cloudflare has an API for everything. We can pull data and fix issues for our customers without them even noticing.\"\n\n### __High-performance network supports a global community__\n\nmogenius supports developers located all over the world. As technical experts, they have high expectations regarding the performance of the applications that they host on the mogenius platform.\n\nAccording to Iltisberger, the Cloudflare global network is essential to meeting these expectations. He says, \"One of our customers is located in Argentina, but his applications are hosted in Frankfurt. When I asked about performance and latency, he said that it was mind-blowing and fast.' I was thinking, 'That has to be Cloudflare. The data delivery to Argentina is so fast, no matter where the applications were hosted.\"\n\nBy routing traffic over the Cloudflare network, mogenius improves performance and decreases its infrastructure costs. Approximately 46% of requests hit the cache, providing a faster response and reducing load and bandwidth requirements for origin servers.\n\n### __Cloudflare solutions enable focus on core business__\n\nThe automated network-level configuration and management provided by Cloudflare is a core component of the mogenius platform. The Cloudflare support team is essential to this success. According to Iltisberger, \"We're very happy with the support we are receiving from the Cloudflare team. We can always rely on their help.\"\n\nCloudflare solutions enable mogenius to scale and focus on automating cloud infrastructure management. Lepsky says, \"Managing everything that Cloudflare does for us in-house would take up at least 20% of our time. With Cloudflare, we can focus on optimizing cloud development and deployment pipelines for our customers.\" By working together, mogenius and Cloudflare provide optimization and automation at every layer of cloud development infrastructure.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __TrueLayer uses Cloudflare Zero trust to ensure seamless employee access to its infrastructure and secure customer financial transactions__\n\nTrueLayer is a front runner in the open banking sector, allowing businesses in any industry to effortlessly connect to bank data, verify accounts, and complete instant, secure account-to account payments and other financial transactions. The TrueLayer open banking API toolkit lets companies rapidly develop and deploy secure consumer and SMB applications for online payments, loans, insurance, investments, and cryptocurrencies in addition to traditional B2B and B2C transactions.\n\nAlthough a relatively young company, TrueLayer is already one of the largest open banking platforms in Europe and one of the first platforms to bring true open banking to the UK, and its EU and worldwide operations continue to expand rapidly. \n\n### __The Challenge: Securely connect consumers, businesses, and banks while maintaining seamless employee access during rapid international expansion__\n\nFrictionless connectivity between consumers, businesses, and banks are prerequisites for success in the Fintech marketplace. For TrueLayer, that starts with APIs — which must be both performant and highly secure. \n\n\"Because TrueLayer deals with private data and banking information, security is our paramount concern,\" explains Alessio Casco, TrueLayer Head of DevOps and Infrastructure. \"Only when we have a secure infrastructure in place, can we develop our API services.\"  \n\nSince its formation, TrueLayer has seen vigorous growth in the UK, Europe, and Australia. With this growth bringing a significant increase in end-user traffic to TrueLayer APIs, the company wanted a DNS solution with widespread coverage in its current and future markets. It also sought the flexibility to support its increasing network demands and a way to maintain a clear distinction between its DNS services and its cloud network provider.\n\nIn addition, TrueLayer sets bold development schedules for its teams in London, Sydney, Milan, and Dublin. To operate at maximum efficiency, Truelayer needed to give employees secure, seamless access to internal resources. As a result, TrueLayer was evaluating ways to replace its VPN-based access management approach with a complete Zero Trust tool set.     \n\n\"Our existing VPN-based infrastructure was difficult to maintain, and it wasn't very manageable. For every user that wants to access a specific portal, we need to create a certificate, sign the certificate, sign the configuration, and send the configuration. After all that, the user still had to install it manually,\" says Casco. \"Although not ideal, it was fine for our engineers, but we wanted to remove the VPN altogether using tested tools to improve all user access to specific things within the cluster, like our tools and dashboards.\"       \n\n### __100% of traffic served with Cloudflare DNS__\n\nIn 2021, TrueLayer began with Cloudflare DNS. From the outset, the solution met TrueLayer's expectations — it provided the company's APIs with superior performance, high availability, unparalleled resilience, and redundancy, in addition to built-in DDoS and DNSSEC protection.\n\n\"Cloudflare has been doing DNS since the beginning, they have alot of technical experience.\" says Casco. \"We wanted greater control over our infrastructure and to isolate ourselves by using a system separate from our cloud provider in case we needed to switch — Cloudflare gave us that option.\" \n\nSince implementing Cloudflare DNS, TrueLayer has bolstered its [API security](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/api-security/) and performance while reducing complexity.\n\n\"With the Cloudflare DNS in place, it is one less thing to think about,\" says Casco. \"We know that the Cloudflare technical team tested the solution with their development and testing partners. We also know Cloudflare can manage almost any scenario. I don't go to sleep worrying about my DNS servers.\" \n\n### __Cloudflare Access reduces maintenance and ensures secure, seamless employee access__\n\nWith Cloudflare DNS in place, TrueLayer began its Zero Trust implementation, beginning with enabling more granular role-based controls across its internal assets and applications. It accomplished this with Cloudflare Access, a Zero Trust Network Access service that enforces default-deny rules for users accessing any application in any type of infrastructure.  \n\n\"Setting up Access was simple. It just works,\" says Casco. \"Unlike our traditional VPN, we configure it once. From there, it is just a matter of adding or removing employees from a group or creating a new Terraform resource. The real savings are in time spent and hassle avoided. With Access, we avoid the long tail of managing individual permissions and portals because everything is an API.\"   \n\nWith almost 500 Access user licenses, TrueLayer has enabled low-friction availability of internal resources to all core employees across the UK, Europe, APAC, and Australia. For TrueLayer employees, this means instant access without configuring a VPN client or installing additional software. Now, connecting to the TrueLayer infrastructure and tools is as simple as opening a webpage and authenticating using a single sign-on (SSO) and Multi Factor Authorization (MFA) with the company's identity provider.\n\nCasco estimates the shift to Access from their self-hosted VPN has helped TrueLayer recover several hours of dedicated employee time per week in maintenance alone. Then there are the efficiency gains of providing every user with a seamless connection to internal resources and ensuring those resources are accessible without interruption.\n\n\"Cloudflare Zero Trust was an easy win. It's simple to configure and use, and we no longer need to dedicate resources to cumbersome VPN maintenance,\" says Casco. \"This allows us to save hours of dedicated employee time.\"\n\n### __A long-term partner on the TrueLayer growth roadmap__ \n\nAs TrueLayer grows its portfolio of API-based open banking services, increases its European coverage, and expands further into new markets, the company intends for Cloudflare to play a significant role along its development roadmap.  \n\n\"As we bring on more services and move into new territories, Cloudflare will be alongside us to provide our DNS, geographic and advanced routing, and traffic management services,\" says Casco. \"Cloudflare will also provide the protection and rules that secure our internal infrastructure as our workforce expands.\"\n\nExplaining TrueLayer's intention to continue development with Cloudflare as a partner, Casco adds:   \n\n\"Like TrueLayer, Cloudflare is very dynamic — they are constantly developing, releasing, and improving their services. They are very modern in their approach to customer support and the way they present information. Cloudflare is also easy to use, has an edge network, and a provider for Terraform — three things every DevOps wants.\" \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare keeps Kiavi's email clean and free of phishing threats__\n<br>\n\nAs a modern technology provider for real estate investors, Kiavi (formerly known as LendingHome) is concerned about email vulnerability to phishing attacks. Email is a key resource for the company, which has helped real estate investors in 32 states unlock over $4.1 billion in value.\n\nKiavi turned to Cloudflare to protect the integrity of its email, realizing how phishing attacks opened the door to [business email compromise](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/ \"Business Email Compromise\") (BEC) and other fraud. BEC allows a criminal gang to pose as a company officer and swindle users into forwarding company funds or confidential data. \"We can't exaggerate the importance of keeping those clever ploys and phishing messages from landing in front of our staff,\" said Donovan Bray, Director of DevOps and IT.\n\n### __Challenge: Difficult-to-detect, low-volume email threats bypassing Gmail's native defenses__\nKiavi knew that it was only a matter of time until the company became a target for spear-phishing emails. The company needed a robust, innovative solution to detect incoming attacks and neutralize the danger. \n\nKiavi started with using Google's Gmail system alone, believing that Gmail's spam filter and rules would catch phishing emails in addition to spam. But that was far from true. Even the best spam filter is not engineered to recognize highly targeted phishing emails. Unlike the avalanches of spam released 24/7, which can be flagged and filtered effectively, phishing campaigns are extremely sophisticated. They are purposely constructed to present a low volume attack profile that doesn't appear on a spam filter's \"radar.\" So hackers can actually steal right past spam defenses and arrive in employee inboxes with an apparently innocent request. The attackers often do their homework and appear to know the company well. This ability to masquerade as legitimate communication is one of the many reasons why phishing is responsible for many breaches.\n\nIn addition to BEC, phishing is the root cause for a spectrum of email attacks. Two notorious phishing attacks faced by other companies were the DocuSign malware and the \"Google Docs\" worm — which posed as email from a trusted contact and tricked users into yielding their permissions, while infecting their contacts too. Relying on a spam filter alone to find and stop phish is similar to leaving doors and windows unlocked when a burglar is in the neighborhood. In addition to the danger of phishing itself, Kiavi employees had to take the time to report potential phishing attempts to Information Security.\n\n### __Kiavi augments employee awareness training with Cloudflare's preemptive email security technology__\nKiavi reviewed a number of anti-phishing solutions before turning to Cloudflare. Of course, they had employee training to recognize phishing attacks, but they wanted to ensure they had the highest levels of protection. So they decided to augment their efforts with Cloudflare's powerful preemptive capabilities, and keep phishing emails from arriving in employees' inboxes. Although training can lower malicious intrusions, just one click on a phishing email can result in a catastrophe. \n\nWith Cloudflare Cloud Email Security, phishing attacks are comprehensively and preemptively stopped. The service acts upon live attacks, which are discovered globally using distributed sensors at specific attack relay points. Sophisticated analytics and innovative web crawling capabilities deliver advanced visibility into emerging and active phishing threats, so they can be proactively shut down before even reaching Kiavi's perimeter. \n\nThe company also appreciates Cloudflare's push notifications that warn of phish in real time, as well as the versatile dashboard. Kiavi wanted to keep users from being bombarded by suspicious emails and expending time and energy to evaluate messages that could be phishing. Yet, each one had to be checked, because phish are getting more and more professional.\n\n### __Cloudflare helps free Kiavi employees from the need to examine, report, and authenticate suspicious emails__\n\"I'm happy to say that Cloudflare exceeded all of our expectations,\" Donovan says. \"It took less than half an hour to get the service up and running.\" \n\nResults were assessed by how often a user reaches out with suspect email to be investigated. Kiavi now goes weeks without a single report — instead of multiple reports per day as in the past. It would have been impossible to reach someone at Google to report the problem—much less having a resolution immediately in place.\n\n\"Even though Google spam filtering does an okay job, we now see plenty of malicious emails caught by Cloudflare after passing through Gmail's filters,\" Donovan says.\n\nPhishing and spoofing are two areas where Kiavi's sees a big improvement in Cloudflare's service, versus Google spam filtering alone. Now, the company sends all malicious, suspicious, and spoof emails automatically to Google quarantine, saving substantial time. \n\nPrior to Cloudflare Cloud Email Security, even with Google's G Suite Spam and Phishing rules, far too many phishing attempts made it to user inboxes. Now, thanks to Cloudflare's effectiveness, phishing concerns have eased dramatically. \"We rolled it out with virtually no trouble, and it's now stable and effective, requiring little to no attention,\" Donovan notes.\n",

						"shortDescription": "Brazilian Fintech Creditas secures its internal resources and keeps remote employees online using Cloudflare Zero Trust Network Access",
						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare Zero Trust secures work-from-home access for 5,000+ Creditas employees__\n\nWhen Spanish entrepreneur Sergio Furio first became aware of the reality of borrowing money in Brazil — where unsecured consumer debt was common and interest rates could reach as high as 100% — he spotted an opportunity.  Furio set out to democratize the Brazilian finance industry and bring liquidity to illiquid assets by making money available at sustainable rates to consumers through home equity and vehicle loans.  \n\nCreditas began partnering with establishment banks in 2012 to provide consumer loans but has since become an independent fintech platform with over 5,000 employees and a valuation of 4.8 billion USD. They have expanded operations into Mexico and Spain, offering home equity, automobile, and secured loans against employee salaries. Creditas also maintains a vehicle marketplace and provides secondary services like vehicle and home insurance.  \n\n### __Challenge: Providing 5,000 employees secure access to internal tools and applications — overnight__\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit Brazil, Creditas were commissioning their newly constructed headquarters, onboarding new hires, and moving its existing workforce to the new space. Then they received instructions from the Brazilian government to send everybody home.\n\n\"Overnight, we had to go from 100% on-site to almost entirely remote,\" explains Ricardo Girardelli, Creditas Network Engineering Team Lead. \"We had to change our entire working model and get everybody offsite in 48 hours.\"\n\nThe Creditas engineering team faced multiple challenges simply keeping employees online during the lockdown. One significant pain point was maintaining a legacy VPN that demanded complex configuration to run on different operating systems (Windows, Linux, and macOS) and could only support a limited subset of employees. \n\nIn addition to a high maintenance effort, the VPN also often required time-consuming collaborations between Creditas teams with their third-party vendors to modify new tools before they were safe to use. \n\nCreditas' next concern was upholding security and data protection standards for 45 internal applications and core third-party tools that were secured only for use within their offices. Unwilling to risk remote data breaches for both the safety of their clients and to remain compliant with Brazil's 2020 Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) personal data protection and privacy legislation, Creditas needed an immediate solution. \n\n\"We are a startup, and don't have the time to build every tool we need, so we use third-party services. With our developers concentrating on user experience and developing new products, we did not want to shift their focus to security if we could avoid it. That said, we had to protect our customer data — a breach would expose us to fines or, worse, fatally damage our reputation and destroy customer trust,\" says Girardelli. \"Without a secure solution, it was not a matter of if, but when the worst would happen. When several local companies got hit with ransomware attacks and experienced data breaches, it was a red flag and a powerful reminder that we could be next.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare core security and a strategic pivot to Zero Trust Network Access__\n\nCreditas reached out to Cloudflare to discuss security services, based on its reputation as a security leader and recommendations from fellow fintech organizations. \n\n\"When we started discussions with Cloudflare, I could tell they actually believed in their products — there was no hard sell, and they had evidence to show they knew what they were talking about,\" recalls Girardelli. \"When Cloudflare offered us an obligation-free proof of concept (POC), and we liked the product, there was no turning back — we are addicted to it.\"  \n\nCreditas began with the Cloudflare core security suite, rapidly implementing the Cloudflare WAF,   global cloud network, certificates, and DDoS protection for secure volumetric and geographic growth as they expanded their territory to include Latin America, Europe, and Mexico.\n\nWith the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the company's focus pivoted to streamlining employee connectivity and securing access to internal resources to meet the high-pressure government deadline to secure remote work. Creditas rapidly deployed Cloudflare Zero Trust, averting the potential threats to the business of working offsite. Specifically, Creditas rolled out Cloudflare Access, a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service, to enforce identity-based authentication per application across their workforce.    \n\n\"Before we got Access up and running, we prepared by organizing our user directory with our identity provider and defining groups for single sign-on (SSO) authorizations,\" says Girardelli. \"The preparations took longer than the deployment, but now we can implement and secure a new tool in a couple of days. We can also have our employees online within hours.\"\n\n### __Efficient use of resources for all Creditas teams__\n\nAccess essentially eliminates the resource-heavy process of dedicating Creditas teams to work with its third-party vendors to recode or reconfigure tools to meet VPN and security requirements. As a result, Creditas DevOps teams have increased their productivity and reduced implementation delays.\n\n\"Before we implemented Cloudflare Access, preparing an application for safe deployment was a two- to four-week project. With Cloudflare Zero Trust, we save almost 90% of that time.\" \n\nThe time saved and lightened workload has also led to improved cooperation between teams. \n\nWith 5,000 Cloudflare Access licenses, the Creditas engineering teams reported additional efficiency gains, including reduced demands from its onboarding and hardware maintenance processes. While the headcount at Creditas has doubled, the engineering team that supports it has increased by less than 30% — an achievement Girardelli attributes to the reduced complexity of tooling like Cloudflare Access which helps engineers more efficiently support the wider organization as it scales. \n\n\"Now our service desk can easily maintain thousands of computers — it is far faster to set up a new employee's computer or replace an existing one with Access because we don't need to install, configure, and test the VPN,\" says Girardelli. \"We can operate using a much more basic setup. If my computer breaks, I can use any other computer and have access to everything by entering a URL. It saves everybody a lot of time.\"    \n\n### __A partnership for growth__\n\nFor Creditas, Cloudflare support is a key factor in the partnership's success. To illustrate, Girardelli recalls the two companies' combined attempts to configure a critical, but unsupported locally developed legacy application to work through Access. \n\n\"The application was a dinosaur, but Cloudflare support refused to give up, even after we exchanged 70 emails to find a resolution. Knowing we have that extra layer of support makes us sleep better at night.\"\n\nIt is one of many reasons Cloudflare continues to play a key role in Creditas' growth. \n\n\"Cloudflare is trustworthy, performant, and intuitive. When I face a challenge with Cloudflare in my corner, I say, 'Yes. I can do that.' With any other vendor, I wouldn't be that confident.\"    \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Arrival incorporates Cloudflare to help improve their internal infrastructure and application security with Zero Trust Network Access__ \n\nArrival is a technology company pioneering a new method of design and production of commercial electric vehicles (EVs) in Microfactories. Founded nearly seven years ago with the vision of making cities better places to live by developing sustainable mobility ecosystems that create clean air for cities all over the world.  It became clear to Arrival that this wouldn't be achievable using old methods and existing technologies - they would need to reinvent both the product and the process together in order to reduce costs and produce better vehicles. This has been achieved by the invention of Arrival's own in-house technologies - software, hardware and robotics - and the use of Microfactories - low CapEx, small footprint production facilities that can be placed locally serving the cities that need them.  \n\nArrival is transforming urban mobility  - right now, the company sees the most opportunity in the commercial EV market, particularly with the growth of [e-commerce](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/). Arrival wants to power a green transition and make our cities better places to live, by developing truly sustainable and equitable mobility ecosystems, creating clean air for communities all over the world. Its decentralized production strategy allows Arrival to make vehicles designed for each city, in the city itself - supercharging the communities they are in. Arrival's Microfactories enable this, also bringing employment to local communities in a manner that's sustainable and helping to grow STEM careers.\n\n### __Challenge: Providing reliable, bandwidth-unrestricted connectivity to users around the globe__\n\nTo connect Arrival's globally distributed workforce to its corporate applications, Arrival initially adopted a commercially licensed, open-source VPN, which showed a poor end-user experience. \n\n\"Despite its broad feature set, our VPN had some issues,\" explains Kirill Sluchanko, Senior Engineer at Arrival, responsible for infrastructure security and liaison between the company's security and IT teams. \"That inflexibility affected our users, who would avoid using the VPN whenever possible.\"\n\nUsers seeking workarounds because of a poor experience unnecessarily exposed themselves and the company to Internet-based threats. This vulnerability affected the company's intentions to develop public services and portals on a larger scale. \n\n\"Arrival can't accept any risks to our internal security. We are a technology company, software is the greatest part of our infrastructure, so we can't compromise,\" says Sluchanko. \"Our priority is to protect our users, infrastructure, and products.\" \n\nAn inability to manage their user access was another issue for Arrival. Their VPN solution was inflexible and offered little granularity regarding which users should be allowed to access specific company resources.\n\n\"We tried to build an access list policy based around each user's group membership, but our VPN just couldn't do that,\" states Sluchanko. \"We needed a tool where our users could connect to the system easily rather than fighting with configuration issues, so we decided to look into a Zero Trust solution.\"  \n\n### __Improving network visibility with Cloudflare analytics and security solutions__ \n\nArrival has been using the Cloudflare security suite since the early stages of the business. They began with Cloudflare DNS, certificates, Web Application Firewall (WAF), firewall rules, DDoS, and Rate Limiting.\n\n\"First, we tested the Cloudflare security suite on one of our internal zones, creating data sources to check performance and behavior. It was great — very easy to implement,\" says Sluchanko. \n\nOn their production system, the Arrival security team discovered that Cloudflare was not limited to protecting their infrastructure from external threats like bots and DDoS attacks. To illustrate, Sluchanko recalls an incident with a bug bounty researcher whose activities in the Arrival data center resulted in an alarming but non-malicious spike in server activity.  \n\n\"We were not expecting a surge, but using Cloudflare logs we were able to rapidly pinpoint and mitigate the source using the Cloudflare firewalls,\" he relates. \"Cloudflare analytics give Arrival unparalleled insight into all of our network traffic, external or internal, malicious or benign.\"  \n\nThat enhanced visibility allows teams at Arrival to spend their time improving rather than monitoring the business. \"We are protected from most threats automatically — Cloudflare stops exploit attempts before they become vulnerabilities,\" he says. \"When we get an incident report we know it is something truly important.\"     \n\n### __Improving Arrival's internal applications and user security with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nTo solve its VPN and user access problems, Arrival evaluated Cloudflare and one other vendor that was an early entrant into the Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) space.\n\n\"We reached out to both companies,\" Sluchanko says. \"With Cloudflare, we began testing their Zero Trust services immediately on their self-service plan. In contrast, the other vendor got back to us 6 months later!\"   \n\nWith the completion of the Proof of Concept (PoC), Arrival adopted Cloudflare Access on an enterprise scale. Their initial focus was on providing secure, VPN-free connectivity and endpoint protection to core company resources. The immediate benefit of the shift to Access was a widespread improvement in user experience for Arrival employees and associates. \n\n\"With Access, our users can connect with a quick click and without friction. Our employees are more efficient because they are not impacted by bandwidth limitations from our traditional VPN,\" says Sluchanko. \"Cloudflare protects our resources and makes our infrastructure even more reliable. That is very comforting.\"       \n\nAccess also simplifies Arrival's application deployment and integration efforts and its native SAML SSO authentication gives their employees and associates connectivity options and improves accessibility.\n\nTo further protect their branch offices and users from malware and ransomware, Arrival is actively rolling out Cloudflare Gateway – a Secure Web Gateway service. Their current Gateway configuration centers on DNS filtering, but Arrival plans to extend the implementation to include TLS and HTTP filtering for both onsite and remote users.\n\n\"Although we have user awareness programs and training, we sometimes face zero-day attempts to reach our sites and servers with malware,\" says Sluchanko. \"Cloudflare Gateway mitigates those concerns around harmful content.\"     \n\nFrom their initial onboarding of the Cloudflare security suite to their rollout of Access and Cloudflare Gateway, Arrival continues to appreciate Cloudflare developer tools and proactive Cloudflare customer support.  \n\n\"Dedicated Cloudflare engineers are always ready to answer our questions, and the Cloudflare developer portal and documentation are great resources,\" says Sluchanko. \"Even the Cloudflare blog is a great tool because it shows us new scenarios and features we might have overlooked.\"  \n\nAccording to Sluchanko, Arrival plans to continue exploring and extending how they use the Cloudflare products in their portfolio as the company continues to grow. \n",

Uniswap Labs is a company that helps to develop the Uniswap protocol, which is the largest decentralized exchange that runs on the Ethereum network. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that allows people to run compute, which is like to run smart contracts and enables people to sort of build a lot of financial tools that are permissionless.\n\n### __What Cloudflare products are you using?__\n\nWe used DNS and then actually deployed to the IPFS network and then use the Cloudflare IPFS Gateway to serve the application to our users. So we use that and then sort of have a couple functions that run on Cloudflare Workers, that are sort of part of that interface.\n\n### __Why did you start using IPFS Gateway and how does it help your organization?__\n\nI think as people working in the Web3 space, we're sort of always interested in technologies and tools that sort of embody the values we care about, which are sort of like, you know, decentralization and open accessibility and IPFS is a cool network that enables sort of this decentralized file storage and serving and so that aligned really well with how, you know, we wanted to build our application and also aligned well with our reliability and security goals.\n\nIt's just nice to have a company like Cloudflare sort of build a product that enable us to use IPFS and serve our front-end to our users. It's super important to us that our users feel secure using our product. And so, you know, for us the main goal is just every bit of code that gets committed to our GitHub repository gets served securely to our users, and they can sort of verify that security and they're using the Uniswap interface in a way that they feel safe.\n\nUniswap works in a way so we never have custody over people's funds, they always retain custody, they're always in control of what they want to do with their tokens and assets. And so I think that's really cool and we sort of take that base foundation and apply it to sort of the application layer as well. And in the way that we build our application to be sort of as decentralized as possible to have as, you know, a minimal amount of third party dependencies and then the way we serve our application users, which is through the IPFS Gateway. \n\n### __What do you think about Cloudflare?__\n\nI'm excited about sort of the products that you all are building. I feel like having IPFS Gateway support running through Ethereum nodes, like to me that's exciting because even though I like being in sort of a hip, cutting edge area, I also care about reliable products and products that people can use and sometimes for that you need large organizations like Cloudflare with a great track record of keeping stuff running and the lights on. And so I'm excited that companies like Cloudflare are sort of entering this domain to partner with smaller companies like us. \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare application services allow SHOPYY's ecommerce customers to operate worldwide in a secure fashion__\n\nSHOPYY was founded in Xiamen with the goal of being the premier international ecommerce platform for China's independent brands. SHOPYY focuses on providing technical solutions for organizations worldwide, including small businesses, small wholesalers, traditional enterprises, platform sellers, and marketing experts. \n\n### __Challenge: Upgrade from a homegrown platform to a mature cloud offering__\n\nAt the early stages of SHOPYY's platform development, cloud services were not readily available to them, resulting in the team building their own system. In 2018, after two years of R&D and internal testing, the in-house SHOPYY platform was officially launched to the market. \n\nAs their user base grew, their self-built system was no longer able to handle the influx of traffic, and the management of SSL certificates became more cumbersome. When a large number of user access requests would reach the server at one time, the system often crashed.  In addition, SHOPYY found that development not only became complicated, but management costs were becoming too high, and reliability was suffering. \n\nTo deal with these overwhelming issues, SHOPYY decided to upgrade its home-grown network to a more sophisticated global cloud network. They needed a partner capable of providing strong support, and they saw Cloudflare as the answer to their problems. \n\n### __SSL for SaaS provides a reliable full-service certificate hosting__\n\nOriginally, to deal with their growing SSL certificate issues, SHOPYY adopted a free certificate management tool. However, these free certificates proved to be unreliable, and had a short validity period. In addition, using the tool took a lot of time and manual effort that the SHOPYY team did not have. They needed to hire additional employees just to oversee this process.\n\nFor these reasons, they turned to Cloudflare — specifically SSL for SaaS, which automates management of SSL certificates. SHOPYY is now able to fully entrust certificate management to Cloudflare without having to worry about any part of the SSL certificate lifecycle. Cloudflare manages the entire process, from private key creation and protection to domain validation, issuance, renewal and re-issuance. As a result, SHOPYY only needs one employee now to maintain the entire Operations and Maintenance structure, reducing staffing costs by approximately 60%. \n\n### __Cloudflare's global network accelerates website access for European and American users__\n\nNearly 80% of SHOPYY's user base is made up of European and American consumers. Before partnering with Cloudflare, SHOPYY used a local CDN. While this CDN was inexpensive, it also had poor performance and availability, sometimes subjecting customers in the US and Europe to prolonged service interruptions. \n\nSHOPYY decided to migrate to Cloudflare's global cloud network. From there parsing, connection, and download times significantly improved regardless of user location. Total loading time saw a 72% improvement. For Los Angeles, California —a highly trafficked area — SHOPYY saw page load times reduce from 272ms, to 16ms - an improvement of 94%. \n\nWhen reflecting on these numbers, Yuanming Chen, SHOPYY's founder and CTO said, \"After implementing Cloudflare, our page load times in Los Angeles, one of our areas with the most customers, decreased by 94%. This improvement lead to an enhanced customer experience and greater customer loyalty.\" \n\n### __Cloudflare security solutions protect SHOPYY from attacks__\n\nIn addition to certificate management and [speed optimization](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/), SHOPYY also began using the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), advanced DDoS protection, and Rate Limiting. SHOPYY is now more protected from attacks, brute-force login attempts, API and application vulnerabilities.\n\nCloudflare's [application security products](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) blocked 4.09 million malicious attacks for SHOPYY in its first 30 days after implementation. Chen was very satisfied with the results, adding, \"Cloudflare has created a dedicated security defense system for us, significantly making SHOPYY more secure and giving peace of mind to our users.\"\n\nCloudflare has not only upleveled SHOPYY's reliability and security, but also delivered significant cost savings. \"The use of Cloudflare products has cut our staffing costs by 60% in operation and maintenance alone,\" said Chen. \"Efficiency and cost-effectiveness are values that Cloudflare has brought to us as a customer, and allows us to provide the same great service to our own customers.\" ",

						"longDescription": "## __Bumrungrad International Hospital sees bandwidth reduction while providing secure, performant access to patient services and information__\n\nBumrungrad International Hospital has been at the forefront of medicine in Thailand for over 40 years. With multiple international accreditations, the 580-bed private hospital has a strong reputation for innovation and quality. Every year, the hospital serves over a million patients from 190 countries.\n\nBumrungrad has always used technology to improve their standard of care. The hospital is an early adopter of emergent medical procedures like robotic-assisted surgery. In 2000, when most healthcare organizations were still exploring integrated patient management systems, Bumrungrad developed and implemented one of the first end-to-end hospital information systems in Thailand. This forward-thinking approach allows Bumrugrad to handle outpatient volumes of 5,500 visitors daily without compromising patient experience or care.\n\n### __The Challenge: Providing frictionless access to information while maintaining strict patient health information standards__  \n\nAs a medical services provider in the highly regulated healthcare sector, Bumrungrad prioritizes patient confidentiality. Providing effective communications and a convenient method of evaluating and booking hospital services and accessing clinical results are also important.  \n\n\"Patient health information and personal and clinical data are our top security priorities. At the same time, however, we want to empower our patients by making our services and their personal data easily accessible through the Bumrungrad application,\" says Wisut Ua-Anant, Bumrungrad's Chief Digital MarTech Officer. \"That means creating secure services that allow them to find a doctor, make an appointment and purchase health screening packages as well as accessing and, where necessary, sharing their personal medical information like prescriptions, lab, and test results.\"\n\nMedical privacy is an important element of these digital experience goals. Bumrungrad must satisfy information management standards established by hospital accreditors like the Joint Commission International (JCI), along with international regulatory requirements for Protected Health Information (PHI) like the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. \n\nBumrungrad also required protection from automated bot traffic and DDoS attacks. \n\n\"Personal health data is a valuable asset to cybercriminals,\" says Ua-Anant. \"To get that data, they use a variety of methods to access a hospital's networks.\"   \n\nCOVID-19, which required Bumrungrad to shift their focus toward the domestic Thai healthcare market, created additional challenges. \n\n\"One of the major impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant reduction in the hospital's international business and a need to refocus on the needs of domestic patients during the crisis,\" says Ua-Anant. \"Bumrungrad is one of the private hospitals supporting the Thai government by administering COVID-19 vaccinations to patients.\"\n\n### __Partnering with Cloudflare for secure, compliant performance enhancements__\n\nBumrungrad engaged Cloudflare as their security partner in 2019, first adopting Cloudflare core internet security services to replace and expand on their existing protections. A primary benefit to the hospital was that Cloudflare provides CDN, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Bot Management services that are consistent with HIPAA and HITECH requirements.  \n\n\"We started with caching, WAF, and country IP blocking to limit special offers to specific counties and regions,\" says Ua-Anant. \"Our previous solutions adequately guarded our assets, but Cloudflare provided better compliance and services that improved performance and enhanced security to our platforms.\" \n\nIn addition to Cloudflare security, the hospital deployed Cloudflare Images, which helps store, optimize, and resize images in the cloud to ensure responsive delivery to all customer devices.   \n\nTo address their concerns over deploying Cloudflare without disruption to the performance of their web properties or customer services, Bumrungrad partnered with a local Cloudflare partner to further ensure efficient delivery. \n\n\"The test stages went well, and our entire implementation was a very smooth process,\" says Ua-Anant. \"Post implementation, we continue to receive rapid, high-quality support from the local and international Cloudflare teams despite a difference in time zones.\"\n\nSince moving to the Cloudflare global network, Bumrungrad has seen significant performance and security gains.\n\n\"In Thailand and other countries in the Asian region, our website is around 12% faster. Our content-rich pages are rendered in less than 1.5 seconds,\" says Ua-Anant. \"By offloading traffic to the Cloudflare cache on the edge, we save about 89% in bandwidth and associated costs.\"              \nWhen it comes to mitigating volumetric threats like bots and DDoS attacks, the gains at Bumrungrad are equally significant — the Cloudflare WAF, bot management, and rate limiting stop an average of 37,000 threats to the hospital site and web applications each month. \n\n\"Cloudflare ensures that our patient data is safe and secure. It also helps maintain our network perimeter, so we can focus on delivering technology and maintaining patient trust,\" says Ua-Anant. \"Cloudflare's ease of use, automatic updates, and automatic threat protection save us time and manpower while allowing us to maintain a high level of cybersecurity against threats that could harm our patients and our business.\"  \n\n### __Improving the patient experience with Cloudflare Waiting Room__\n\nThe Bumrungrad website experienced a significant challenge at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic after the hospital announced their vaccination program and the availability of the Moderna vaccine in Thailand. \n\n\"When we made the alternative vaccine available for online registration, traffic to the Bumrungrad website and our online booking application spiked,\" says Ua-Anant. \"Overnight, more than two million users tried to access our website to reserve vaccinations and make appointments.\"\n\nTo deal with the traffic, Bumrungrad turned to Waiting Room, the rapidly-configurable Cloudflare queue and traffic management solution. After setting Waiting Room up directly through the Cloudflare dashboard, Bumrungrad dynamically routed their mobile and desktop users offsite to a responsive, hospital-branded virtual queueing page. By managing traffic on the fly in this way — rather than returning error messages or subjecting patients to over-long load times — Waiting Room protected the hospital's origin servers and kept the site from being overwhelmed, and prevented abandoned registrations by informing patients of their progress.  \n\n\"Cloudflare was instrumental in helping us manage website traffic throughout the vaccine registration surge,\" says Ua-Anant. \"Waiting room kept the site online while maintaining a positive user experience that allowed our patients to complete their registrations and online purchases. It kept the website working like it should.\"\n\nMoving forward, Bumrungrad plans to use their partnership with Cloudflare to continue building strong foundations for a digital healthcare ecosystem based on an edge infrastructure that supports their telemedicine and telehealth services and direct-to-nurse chat as well as forwarding their automated marketing, online purchasing, and ePayment initiatives. \n\n\"The standard of Cloudflare services is great, and they keep improving,\" concludes Ua-Anant. \"We are looking forward to exploring new Cloudflare offerings that we can use to enhance future application development.\"",

						"longDescription": "## __Logistics leader handles peak customer demand with scalable global network from Cloudflare__\n\nDHL is the first international delivery service, and since its founding in 1969, it has grown into one of the largest logistics companies in the world. In the Netherlands, DHL Parcel delivers 1.5 million parcels every day to businesses and homes using Europe's largest fleet of zero-emissions electric vehicles. Globally, the company has more than 650,000 employees, including 6,000 in Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. \n\n### __Reshaping last-mile logistics__\n\nPackage delivery has always been seasonal, surging during big holidays and mega-shopping days, but at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, DHL Parcel saw its volumes nearly double. Well positioned for post-pandemic growth, [DHL saw revenue increase 22% in 2021](https://www.dhl.com/global-en/home/press/press-archive/2022/dpdhl-group-closes-2021-with-record-earnings.html), its highest ever.\n\nConsumers are buying more online, and they want to know exactly when their packages are arriving. Businesses need real-time tracking of their deliveries to improve efficiency, maintain traceability, and meet their customers' expectations in a changed world. \n\nAs the pandemic upended last-mile logistics virtually overnight, DHL Parcel Netherlands was ready for the surge. \n\n\"Managing peaks is in our nature,\" says Jan De Groot, Vice President of Digital and Business Process Optimization at DHL Parcel Netherlands. \"We didn't need to change anything because we were prepared.\"\n\nDHL Parcel Netherlands had already moved key applications to the cloud, including track and trace, and had designed its microservices environment for maximum scalability. \"All of our microservices can scale indefinitely,\" he says. \n\nDHL Parcel Netherlands partnered with Cloudflare to ensure scalability, simplify security, and maintain operational efficiency as the business continues to grow. \n\n### __Delivering a better customer experience__\n\nDHL Parcel leverages Cloudflare Content Delivery Network (CDN), Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Cloudflare TLS Encryption for its operations in the Benelux. \n\nCloudflare CDN allows DHL Parcel to deliver its content over the global Cloudflare edge network. Cloudflare Argo Smart Routing provides a unique vantage point to detect real-time congestion and route traffic across the fastest and most reliable paths, ensuring customers have real-time, personalized visibility into their package deliveries. \n\n\"With Cloudflare, we can serve content from the edge,\" says De Groot. \"The closer the content is to the edge, the better the user experience is.\" \n\nThe global Cloudflare network provides DHL Parcel with precise control over how both dynamic and static content is cached. Delivering content from the edge improves the user experience and drives down bandwidth costs because it reduces the need to source content from DHL's backend databases and web systems. \n\n\"We can reduce the amount of traffic we get from bots and crawlers who hit our site,\" says De Groot. \"Cloudflare helps us manage our traffic and avoid getting a flood of requests that would limit our ability to serve new information to customers.\" \n\nReducing automated traffic reduces costs and preserves bandwidth for legitimate business use. \n\n### __Ensuring strong security and compliance__\n\n\"We have zero tolerance for security breaches,\" says De Groot. \"We protect customer data and make sure all communications with our clients are secure.\" \n\nWith Cloudflare TLS, DHL Parcel can extend strong encryption to its consumer and business-to-business customer communications, regardless of which web browser they use. \n\nFrom malicious browser plug-ins to the latest application and network threats, Cloudflare helps DHL Parcel protect its business and customers against data breaches and business disruption. \n\nEven as attacks rise, DHL Parcel can simplify compliance requirements for customer-facing applications who need to comply  with the EU's General Data Protection Requirements (GDPR) as well as Germany's even more stringent data protection laws. \n\n\"Cloudflare helps DHL Parcel protect our customer data and client communications, simplifying compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR,\" says de Groot. \n\nCloudflare WAF protects the company's web applications and [APIs](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/api-security/) from zero-day vulnerability exploits as well as attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site scripting, and SQL injection. This way, DHL can protect its web applications — even as attacks become more complex and diverse. \n\nCloudflare Rate Limiting automatically identifies and mitigates excessive requests. \"We can block certain IP addresses where people are trying to hack our systems,\" he says. \"It's a big advantage that we don't have to bother with the malicious traffic,\" de Groot says. \n\nUnmetered DDoS, built into Cloudflare CDN, provides powerful protection for the company's cloud-native applications and websites and ensures the [performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) of legitimate traffic is not compromised.  \n\n### __A relationship built on proven value__\n\nDHL Parcel initially looked to Cloudflare to protect its web operations from rising DDoS attacks, but over the years, the relationship has grown. \"We collaborate well with Cloudflare,\" says De Groot. \"Cloudflare is constantly delivering new features,\" he says. \"We can play with new technologies easily, and if there's a benefit, we can enable them.\" \n\nThat agility and innovation adds value as [ecommerce](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) continues to grow for both businesses and consumers. DHL sees a bright future for business-to-business ecommerce, predicting that [80% of sales interactions between suppliers and buyers](https://www.logisticsbusiness.com/latest-news/dhl-express-predicts-considerable-b2b-e-commerce-growth/) will take place through digital channels by 2025.\n\nDHL Parcel Netherlands is ready to adapt to changing consumer tastes and keep global economies running as it delivers more packages to homes and businesses. DHL Parcel's operations in Sweden, Poland, Portugal and other regions rely on the cloud applications created by the Netherlands team. \n\n\"Cloudflare is a growth enabler for DHL Parcel,\" says De Groot. \"Cloudflare provides out-of-the-box security that helps alleviate my team's workload and allows us to focus on the business.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare Zero Trust solutions provide Carousell employees with secure access to internal domains, websites, and IT infrastructure",
						"longDescription": "## __Securing Carousell's internal networks and providing seamless remote employee access with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nIn 2012, Quek Siu Rui, Lucas Ngoo, and Marcus Tan had an idea — a smartphone- and web-based marketplace that made buying goods as easy as chatting and selling them as simple as taking a picture. Carousell is that idea made a reality.\n\nToday, Carousell is one of Asia's largest C2C [ecommerce marketplaces](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/). They are one of the top lifestyle shopping apps in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and have a rapidly growing presence across Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, and the Philippines. Carousell users turn to the site to buy cars, property, fashion, household appliances, assistive devices, and electronics. The site also hosts job listings and offers services across a continually expanding range of industries.\n\nMore than a quarter of Singapore's population uses Carousell, and that figure continues to grow as more Singaporean and international users gravitate to the site. \n\n### __The Cloudflare WAF and global cloud network — a successful partnership since 2016__\n\nIn 2016, Carousell turned to Cloudflare to serve over 1 PB of images per month and provided a frictionless user experience for its customers. As traffic increased, Cloudflare enabled Carousell to meet its intensive performance requirements, ensuring uptime during high-traffic events like the company's regular flash sales. Using Cloudflare to cache dynamic pages on an as-needed basis, Carousell is able to handle spikes over 3x of its typical traffic without strain — a level of performance competing CDN providers were unable to match despite higher costs for similar data volumes. \n\n\"Our relationship with Cloudflare started off as a solution for our DNS and SSL termination requirements. Then we started exploring the Cloudflare Cache and started moving our assets over from a different CDN,\" explains Sanjeev Jaiswal, the Carousell Group's Senior Director of DevOps, SR (Site Reliability), Platform and Cybersecurity Engineering. \"Now we are 100% cached. Cloudflare's global edge network handles our CDN, WAF, caching, SSL endpoints, and DNS requirements. Cloudflare helps us meet our business objectives and gives us an excellent return on our investment.\"\n\nIn addition to speeding up and scaling the platform, Cloudflare protects Carousell against volumetric security threats like DDoS attacks and resource-draining bots, as well as malicious activity like cross-site scripting (XSS). The Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) leverages collective threat intelligence to identify and prevent malicious requests, empowering Carousell to proactively defend against incoming attacks and ensure application availability. \n\n\"The Cloudflare WAF ticks all of our boxes with OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and Cloudflare specialized rules. We can also easily add custom rules, making Cloudflare a perfect fit for our needs,\" recalls Jaiswal. \"After turning on the firewall features, there was no measurable hit on latency. Cloudflare security features don't impact our overall [site performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/), and our user experience doesn't degrade as we put more checks in place. That is one of the biggest ongoing benefits we see using Cloudflare.\"\n\n### __Solving workforce security challenges with Cloudflare Zero Trust__\n\nSince 2019, Carousell has progressively embraced remote work to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and to support an increasing international employee and contractor workforce. In light of these fundamental changes, Carousell began a strategic reexamination of its own organizational security. This meant a renewed focus on protecting internal infrastructure while [providing secure employee access to corporate applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/).\n\n\"We are looking at everything with a fresh set of eyes, onboarding an expanded security team, working with external auditors to put new security policies in place, and participating in a bug bounty program with security researchers and ethical hackers,\" says Jaiswal. \"The goal is to take our findings from these initiatives, enhance site capabilities, and improve access to the Carousell infrastructure and applications while refining our approach to identity and privilege management.\"\n\nBefore Cloudflare, the company evaluated a competitor and early entrant into the [Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/) category. But that vendor's complexity proved prohibitive from both the adoption and end-user perspectives.\n\n\"Carousell didn't have a great architecture in terms of security or ease of access. It was very cumbersome, and we didn't want to repeat that level of complexity moving forward,\" says Jaiswal. \"The other solution we considered was far too complicated to implement. It required multiple command line parameters for simple SSH access to a single machine. In comparison, the Cloudflare Zero Trust solution was easy to implement and very well-defined,\" he adds.  \n\nCarousell [implemented](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/how-to-implement-zero-trust/) Cloudflare Zero Trust to safeguard access to its internal applications, websites, and domains across cloud and on-premise environments. The solution eliminated the company's concerns about using riskier alternative access methods, such as IP- and geolocation-based controls or catch-all passwords. \n\nWith Cloudflare, Carousell now grants application access based on verification with its preferred identity provider, and administrators build stronger security policies based on user role and group membership on a per-app basis. In the process, Carousell has been able to shift away from its traditional VPN as a single point of access and has regained visibility across every access event.\n\nCarousell saw immediate benefits from Cloudflare Zero Trust. They saved time and improved efficiency for both employees authenticating to applications and the security team that configures access. \n\n\"Cloudflare streamlines our developers' remote connections and improves productivity. Instead of downloading VPN profiles, configuring access, and figuring out which resource they need to connect to, the Zero Trust solution provides a single, easily-configured agent with pre-defined routing. It's simple to connect seamlessly to our production or non-production resources. That alone saves a minimum of 15 minutes per user every month,\" says Jaiswal. \n\n\"On the SRE team's side, the savings are much greater. We don't need to troubleshoot and maintain availability on multiple unreliable VPN tunnels for different production environments,\" continued Jaiswal. \"Cloudflare saves us hours of pain and friction and gives us back time to focus on our bigger projects and initiatives.\" \n\nImplementing Zero Trust Network Access has also reduced the time Carousell spends maintaining its internal security policies. Centralized administration means user roles are easily created and maintained, and authorizations are just as easily revoked as staff turns over.\n\n\"Because Cloudflare ties a user's credentials back to their role, when an employee leaves, it is a simple matter for the SRE team to disable and remove accounts and prohibit firewall access,\" says Jaiswal. \"Having that single point of administration greatly simplifies things.\"  \n\nCarousell started with 500 Zero Trust licenses, and is currently looking to expand across business units to a total of 800-1000 technical and non-technical employees. \n\nThe Carousell SRE team is also exploring ways to integrate Cloudflare Rate Limiting with its existing cloud infrastructure. They intend to replace a competing product that costs up to 5 times more but provides near-identical functionality.      \n\nHaving never worked with Cloudflare solutions before, but with plenty of experience in products that claim to provide similar services, Jaiswal was particularly impressed with the Cloudflare's ease of use and ongoing customer support. \n\n\"Based on clear Cloudflare onboarding tutorials and training materials, we were able to put together our own internal videos to accelerate the learning curve,\" he says. \"More importantly, Cloudflare account teams communicate very well, from answering queries to resolving our issues and even providing future roadmap announcements.\"\n\n\"Cloudflare efficiently delivers a complex Zero Trust security solution that is easy to use and reliable as clockwork,\" Jaiswal adds. \"It is cheaper, works out of the box, and integrates seamlessly with our existing cloud environment and infrastructure.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare Zero Trust solutions secure Blibli's infrastructure for a frictionless online shopping experience__  \n\nWith a population of over 273 million, Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing consumer markets, with [ecommerce revenues growing nearly 20 percent annually](https://globaleyez.net/introduction-e-commerce-indonesia/). Amidst significant regional and international competition, locally-owned Blibli is one of the country's top five [online retailers](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/). \n\nFounded in 2011, Blibli maintains a strong following with Indonesia's most affluent consumers, a demographic expected to double from [9 percent to 21% of the population by 2030](https://www.techinasia.com/underdog-blibli-top-dogs-indonesian-ecommerce). Offering unmatched quality is Blibli's key strategy — in a market where counterfeit goods are common, Blibli guarantees their inventory and brand name products are genuine. They offer a no-question, money-back return policy on everything they sell. As a result, Blibli customers are more likely to make their higher-value transactions on the Blibli platform than through competing channels.  \n\n### __Challenge: Maintaining a reliable consumer marketplace in a threat-heavy online environment__\n\nBlibli faced several challenges — some common to online enterprises and some exclusive to Indonesia. The company's primary pain points were competitor-driven DDoS and bot attacks and a fragile payment gateway. \n\n\"To conduct payment in Indonesia, Blibli payment gateway service needs a direct connection with the bank,\" explains Rendra. \"It can't reside in the cloud. We need to maintain an on-premise payments infrastructure and keeping that infrastructure secure is one of our top priorities.\"   \n\nBlibli needs [threat protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) above current Indonesia IXP can provide. Blibli site and payment gateway were particularly vulnerable to deliberate volumetric DDoS attacks. The attacks occurred during major promotions and advertised online events, leaving Blibli customers unable to complete payments even though they were able to put things in their carts. Blibli was losing revenue and brand reputation.\n\nIn addition to DDoS attacks, malicious bots strained Blibli's hosting infrastructure, increased bandwidth costs due to traffic spikes, made products unavailable by hoarding inventory, and skewed expenses with unusually high off-peak traffic volumes. Blibli needed to ensure they could [process customer transactions without any interruptions](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/).       \n\nFinally, Blibli sought to improve security and governance over their internal infrastructure and gain more granular control over employee access. \"Achieving a Zero Trust infrastructure was always part of the plan,\" explains Rendra. \"But the pandemic pushed us to quickly find a solution that allowed our employees to work securely from home.\" \n\n### __Securing on-premise payment systems against DDoS attacks with Cloudflare Magic Transit__  \n\nIn 2019, Blibli moved to Cloudflare. \"Our previous solution was difficult to use, time-consuming to configure, and slow to propagate changes. It also wasn't very effective,\" relates Rendra. \"Cloudflare is a much more agile solution — we make changes often and see them reflected immediately. The Cloudflare dashboard is also much more user-friendly because it is designed to be used by anyone, not just security experts and CDN specialists.\"    \n\nWith several major events planned and DDoS attacks surging, Rendra and the Blibli team implemented Cloudflare Magic Transit — the secure managed networking solution that operates on layers 3 and 4. The goal was to ensure their payment infrastructure and network assets were [safeguarded](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/) using private network interconnects. Before implementing Magic Transit, Rendra and his team spent a significant amount of time and resources reactively, rather than proactively, combatting attacks.  \n\n\"Magic Transit was our savior. During the emergency onboarding, Cloudflare engineers secured our infrastructure very rapidly,\" explains Rendra. \"We worked together to determine what kind of traffic we would let through and what we wouldn't. Now it just works seamlessly — when attacks happen, we monitor them from the dashboard and carry on with our work day.\" \n\nBlibli configured Magic Transit and Magic Firewall in under 48 hours, effectively mitigating the ongoing DDoS attacks and helping them gain critical network visibility. \"Since then, it hasn't required much additional attention at all. It is easy to create firewall rules and immediately deploy them when we see something happening or when we get intelligence that an attack will occur soon.\" \n\nCloudflare has created a better experience for Blibli users and the security team. \"With Magic Transit in place, we can honor our SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for event tickets and ensure our customers a failure-free shopping experience,\" he says, \"When management announces an event and asks me about our security landscape, I can say with complete peace of mind, \"We got this. We are good to go.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management stops malicious inventory blocking and reduces network costs__\n\nWith their DDoS issues resolved, Blibli focused on implementing Cloudflare Bot Management to monitor automated activity on their domains and block attempts to hoard inventory. \n\n\"We were concerned about blocking beneficial traffic like Google and price comparison sites that provide us with positive exposure,\" says Rendra. \"Using Cloudflare Bot Management, we can identify and allow good bot traffic while using Rate Limiting on login post requests to stop application-layer attacks on our pages.\"  \n\nBlibli also relies on Cloudflare threat intelligence and JA3 fingerprint identification to combat unwanted traffic. Overall, Cloudflare has reduced bot activity on Blibli domains by over 35%, resulting in corresponding savings on infrastructure costs without impeding organic search rankings or useful third-party links.\n\n### __Cloudflare Zero Trust secures Blibli's workforce__\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic not only forced Blibli to transition to remote work but also to keep up with increased demand for goods online. Blibli's distributed employees and partners needed more secure, efficient ways to connect to their corporate applications and the Internet to remain productive and serve their growing customer base.\n\nBlibli turned to Cloudflare Zero Trust to proactively address their remote work security needs. Blibli rolled out Cloudflare's Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution to apply granular, identity-based access controls for priority users who interact with sensitive data in internal applications. Over time, Blibli plans to extend these Zero Trust controls to several hundred more users and a broader range of resources, including SaaS apps and legacy apps hosted in private IP spaces.\n\nBlibli appreciates how easy Cloudflare made it to [secure applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/), deploy a device client, and set up policies. \n\n\"We wanted to accelerate our Zero Trust plan, but we did not want to substantially increase overhead by adding extra appliances or setting up dedicated services,\" Rendra said. \"Cloudflare Zero Trust fit the bill perfectly. It was easy to integrate into our infrastructure and connect to our portfolio of applications.\"\n\nFrom now on, the Blibli security and IT teams are thinking proactively about better protecting their devices and data while users browse the Internet. One early step will be layering Secure Web Gateway (SWG) capabilities such as DNS & HTTP filtering and inspection to protect users from online threats like phishing and ransomware. In the long term, Blibli is exploring ways to leverage Cloudflare's Browser Isolation to insulate users from untrusted web content further and protect data that users interact with in their browsers.\n\nCloudflare solutions and support are central to Blibli's continued growth in Indonesia. \"The Cloudflare engineering team is always there to help us ensure our rules are set up right,\" says Rendra. \"Cloudflare support is so effective that any organization can provide onboard the solution without much technical knowledge.\"  \n\n\"In the past, when zero-day threats arose, we were only aware of them following the vulnerability. Now, the Cloudflare team responds immediately, providing advice and mitigating attacks before going offline. It is the speed of that response that we appreciate.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Nexylan protects major French brands' websites against DDoS attacks with Cloudflare Magic Transit and Firewall",
						"longDescription": "## __Nexylan uses Cloudflare Network Services to reinforce the availability of major French brands' business-critical sites__\n\nNexylan offers premium managed hosting services to some of the biggest brands in France, including Decathlon, Zodio (groupe Adeo), Alten, Zoomalia, and Europcar. Since their founding in 2009, Nexylan has expanded to support 1.5 million visitors. Their customers give them a 98% satisfaction rating and 4.9/5 stars for customer service.\n\nIn 2021, Nexylan joined the international Total Webhosting Solutions (TWS) group. As part of this group, Nexylan supports primarily French organizations with 100% hosting in France. Over 1,000 servers are hosted in three data centers located in the north of France.\n\n### __Challenge: DDoS attacks threaten customer website availability and revenue__\n\nFor Nexylan, the availability of their customers' sites is a top priority. As a premium managed hosting provider, Nexylan serves organizations whose websites are a critical part of their business.\n\nDistributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks can pose a serious threat to the availability of major, highly-visible brands. Before partnering with Cloudflare, Nexylan had encountered several sophisticated DDoS attacks against their clients' sites.\n\nWhile Nexylan had DDoS protection in place at the time, it no longer provided the level of protection and availability guarantees that Nexylan wanted to provide to its customers. The previous solution could effectively filter DDoS traffic, but needed to be manually configured to block attack traffic. This reliance on manual responses limited its effectiveness and left Nexylan and their customers more vulnerable to automated and constantly evolving DDoS attacks.\n\n### __Magic Transit provides critical attack protection and business continuity__\n\nFor nearly a decade, Nexylan has taken advantage of Cloudflare's global edge network to improve the responsiveness of their customers' websites.With Cloudflare Magic Transit, Nexylan immediately perceived this solution as being more suitable and logical to meet the needs of its customers.\n\nGaetan Allart, Managing Director and Founder at Nexylan, was impressed with Magic Transit from the very start. After carefully scheduling the migration at 5:00 a.m. to minimize disruption, the actual migration process was seamless with no disruption to services.\n\nHe said, \"We turned it on, and it just worked. The pre-migration checklist from Cloudflare is impressive. It really does check everything. Really nice pre-migration work from Cloudflare made it 100% transparent.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare support gives Nexylan greater flexibility__\n\nWith Magic Transit, Nexylan has the automated DDoS traffic detection and filtering capabilities that they need to block sophisticated threats against their customers' sites. However, this improved security is not the only benefit that it brings to the organization.\n\nAllart has always worked with a human-sized team and is usually the lead on managing and resolving higher risk network tasks. With Cloudflare Support, he now can be supported by a team of experts that can help troubleshoot advanced issues with the network.\n\nNexylan is using Cloudflare Magic Firewall to manage access to its customer sites. Magic Firewall's intuitive user interface has also enabled Allart to transition some network and security management duties over to other experts of his team.\n\nHe says, \"In the past, filtering had to be done through complex access-lists across multiple network equipments. Now, it can be all managed through the Cloudflare Dashboard, fill in the form, and press validate. With less risks, more people can now manage security.\"\n\nNexylan's deployment of Magic Transit has also had a positive impact on the company's brand image. With Magic Transit managing DDoS protection and BGP advertisements, their network is even more reliable and hosted sites' availability and resiliency have improved.\n\n### __Partnering for customer success__\n\nAllart asserts that Magic Transit provides an important additional layer of reassurance against DDoS attacks, calling it a \"rock-solid network umbrella.\" However, the technology is not the only reason why he partners with Cloudflare.\n\nHe says, \"What we find at Cloudflare is what we want to provide as a service provider to our customers. We both want customers to choose us because we are experts at what we do and want to be partners in our customers' journey to success.\"",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare Zero Trust solutions boost the security and performance of public WiFi in Seine-et-Marne's secondary schools__\n\nDigitization and Internet access within its schools were urgent priorities for the Department of Seine-et-Marne, a region in Northern France. This government department provides services for a growing population, including many young people who see Internet usage at school as a basic necessity. In addition, staff at the department's 129 state secondary schools serving teenagers need secure, reliable internet connectivity in order to complete their work and keep malicious and unwanted content away from students. \n\nFaced with these needs, the department began to look for a suitable cyber security solution that would enable them to offer WiFi access without putting their networks at risk. \n\n### __Challenge: Roll out WiFi hotspots and security across the department's 129 state schools quickly and efficiently__ \n\nMuch of the Internet usage in the department's schools takes place on personal mobile devices, which presents a host of security risks. The department needed a network security service that would protect the network from public Internet usage on any device. \nIn addition, the department wanted an out-of-the-box solution that would not only optimize WiFi hotspots with enough capacity to support guest traffic, but  would also be easy to manage and updated regularly. The scalability of the solution was another key selection criteria, as the local authorities were already anticipating a growth in Internet traffic and associated cyber risks.\n\n### __Cloudflare now provides secure traffic management for connected devices__\n\nTo address these issues, Cloudflare Gateway — a secure web gateway with DNS filtering capabilities to protect users from harmful content — was deployed across The Department of Seine-et-Marne, with the help of a partner DC Communication. Upon completion of a proof-of-concept phase, the department, DC Communication, Cambium Networks and Cloudflare were able to roll out the solution across every school within a very short timeframe. \n\nCloudflare Gateway users log in through a firewall via Active Directory, from a dedicated Stormshield captive portal. Malicious sites and cyberattacks are blocked effectively with no admin time required. \n\nFor the secondary schools themselves, their traffic is managed by teams from the department with the support of DC Communication, and they work to operate the  solutions from Cambium Networks and Cloudflare. As Olivier Millien, Deputy Director of Digital Learning explains, \"This comprehensive solution allows us to guarantee connectivity and access to information for our students, teachers and staff, allowing our internal teams to work more efficiently while avoiding potential cyber security issues.\"\n\nFor DC Communication, the solutions from Cambium Networks and Cloudflare allow them to ensure a long-term, high-end service. Rémy Millescamps, CEO of DC Communication, explains, \"The Cloudflare points of presence are capable of handling large volumes of simultaneous connections, allowing us to respond to the growth in connected terminals with an easy-to-manage solution.\" \n\n### __Separating learning from administrative tasks with a WiFi solution dedicated to students and teachers__\n\nBy installing WiFi hotspots in secondary schools, the department has helped improve mobile device usage. As a result, students and teachers benefit from dedicated WiFi access, as do administrative teams. \n\nToday, the WiFi hotspots available across the department's secondary schools allow students and teachers to connect to the Internet from anywhere within the building from any device. Accelerated connectivity supported by Cloudflare Gateway ensures online access for up to 300 tablets or laptops per school. \n\nIn addition, teachers can also connect their personal computers to the school WiFi without compromising the security of the network. This enhances the user experience and provides a better working environment.\n\n### __A versatile and responsive wireless connectivity solution__\n\nFor the department, secure web browsing and DNS filtering protection against cyber attacks have not been the only advantages gained from rolling out the solution offered by DC Communication and Cloudflare. It was also important to implement a solution that was quick to install, as well as adaptable, responsive and long-lasting.\n\nThe majority of solutions available on the market would not have guaranteed the same level of security and responsiveness to such a wide variety of threats as Cloudflare Gateway does. Rémy Millescamps explains, \"Cloudflare Gateway ensures security for a wide variety of applications used on the school WiFi network, including a wide range of educational software as well as video platforms. We wouldn't be able to operate as securely as we do without Gateway.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Polestar drives Chinese consumer confidence and scores a Super Bowl win with Cloudflare__\n\nPolestar has always focused on performance and innovation. From its roots as an automotive racing team, the organization evolved to become Volvo's performance tuning arm. Under the Volvo brand, the Polestar badge became synonymous with the Swedish manufacturer's more sporty offerings. \n\nToday, as an independent electric car manufacturer, Polestar applies its talent toward the development and manufacture of design-forward, performance-oriented luxury electric vehicles (EVs). The company's ethos— Pure Progressive Performance — is at the heart of its approach to all aspects of the business, from the cars it designs to the end-to-end customer experience it provides.\n\n### __The Challenge: Improving Chinese customer confidence, finding a strategic development partner, and ensuring highly-performant content delivery__\n\nFor automobile manufacturers, an effective digital infrastructure is central to both product performance and how customers perceive and interact with the manufacturer. Within the performance EV sector, Polestar has the mechanical pedigree, but wants to take its digital experience to the next level.   \n\n\"Polestar has a unique take on how to buy a car and it's very important to us to deliver on those expectations,\" explains Mikael Vesavuori, Cloud Software Architect and Technical Standards Lead at Polestar. \"Whether you purchase our cars online or visit one of the Polestar spaces, we tie together the physical and digital dimensions to provide a much richer retail and automotive encounter.\"\n\nOne way they achieve this is the Polestar Configurator, a central feature of Polestar's distinctive physical spaces. It is a media-rich digital and physical touchpoint that familiarizes buyers with vehicle configurations, options, and interior and exterior materials and trim. \n\nUnfortunately, the Polestar Configurator experienced performance and availability issues in China — a lucrative market where one in every five cars sold is an EV (1).\n\nAt the heart of the problem was Polestar's CDN provider, which had issues with the restrictive Chinese Internet infrastructure and connectivity problems with its global AWS network. The only solution was a partner that could overcome the latency, congestion and peering, and DNS issues that negatively affected customer perceptions of Polestar technology and the cars themselves.         \n\nIn addition to solving these issues, Polestar wanted a strategic partnership to aid along its software development roadmap. The company was developing a micro-front end architecture for its web presence that relied on multiple applications. These applications needed to interact seamlessly to provide a user experience that aligned with Polestar's brand objectives. \n\n\"We were looking for a proactive partner with developer experience, but we were sitting in meetings with vendors simply handing us documentation and saying, 'Here's how you can deal with the challenges you are facing,'\" says Johan Larsson, Technical Lead for the Polestar Platform Team.    \n\nFinally, as Polestar scaled its online and physical spaces internationally and began more proactively marketing its products, they wanted enterprise-class security and content delivery to ensure they remained performant in every imaginable scenario and market.\n\n### __The Cloudflare China Network provides world-class performance and reliability__\n\n\"It was a matter of perfect timing in a very poor situation,\" says Vesavuori, explaining Polestar's move to Cloudflare. With the current CDN partnership up for contract renewal and Chinese connectivity lagging, Polestar began researching to find the ideal solution partner. \n\n\"The list went from many names to very few,\" he explains. \"Only Cloudflare ticked all the boxes and met all of our absolute requirements for a dedicated China network — brand stability, proven reliability, and a very DevOps-oriented approach.\"\n\nAfter the switch, Polestar saw an immediate improvement in the performance of its on-site Configurator and web properties due to the Cloudflare China Network's partnership with China's largest Internet and cloud services provider, JD Cloud. The partnership provides Cloudflare clients with a geographically dispersed network presence in major cities across China to serve their static and dynamic content, and unrestricted access to Cloudflare serverless computing. \n\n\"With our previous vendor, everything was difficult to configure and troubleshoot,\" says Larsson. \"With Cloudflare, it just worked like magic. We instantly saw performance — our Chinese pages were as accessible as any other page, anywhere in the world.\"  \n\n\"Our most important gain in the move to Cloudflare China was the improvement across the board in predictability and stability. It always works,\" Vesavuori adds. \"On the customer side, that ability to deliver reliable technology ensures trust.\"\n\n### __A Super Bowl performant win with Workers and the Cloudflare global network__   \n\nIn addition to adopting the Cloudflare China Network, Polestar moved away from its underperforming cloud services and CDN  provider, switched to the Cloudflare global network for content delivery worldwide, and began web development using Cloudflare Workers serverless edge computing services.\n\nWhen it came to development, Polestar was able to rapidly migrate its entire micro-front-end architecture and applications to Workers, the Cloudflare serverless platform for running applications and code on the network edge. Cloudflare documentation, in addition to its strong online community and consultations, demos, and walkthroughs from proactive Cloudflare support teams further accelerated the transition. \n\nAnother win for the company was the ability to easily test its releases using Workers, a process Polestar previously found tedious and time-consuming. The time saved freed up Polestar's technical teams to focus on core business goals.   \n\n\"Workers was the most compatible with the tech we use to develop our applications — other vendor's solutions were abstracted in a way that made it difficult to get a sense of what would happen when we made changes,\" Larsson explains. \"Using Workers, we have granular control of everything and we can easily test to ensure our setup is correct before we release anything.\" \n\nOn the content delivery side, Polestar put the Cloudflare global network to the test when it aired the ['No Compromises'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QI0VzbkHk) commercial during Super Bowl 2022. The advertisement resulted in over 150,000 website visits — a traffic increase of almost 500 percent — in the two minutes after it aired. The site also saw an increase in long-tail traffic of around 15% for weeks following the tv commercial. \n\n\"Immediately after airing the Super Bowl commercial, viewers completed over 2000 configurations. We also saw a sales record for cars sold post event without fatal errors or us even flinching,\" says Vesavuori. \"Without Cloudflare as part of our core infrastructure, that could not have happened.\" \n\nWith 99.7% of its traffic served from the Cloudflare cache — up from a maximum of 80% percent with its previous providers — the Polestar network is faster and more [resilient](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/) than ever. Cloudflare image resizing and optimization further lighten Polestar's bandwidth requirements, increase performance, and render its graphically-intensive website responsive on any device. \n\nLooking forward, Polestar intends to strengthen its partnership with Cloudflare and explore new services. The company is looking into [Cloudflare Stream](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/) for its video storage, encoding, and adaptive bitrate playback, in addition to digging deeper into Workers KV, the Cloudflare edge key-value-data storage solution.\n\n\"Cloudflare is taking steps that disrupt the traditional marketplace. It's very interesting to follow their emerging services and figure out how they will improve our next generation of applications on the edge,\" says Larsson.\n\n\"Cloudflare is Polestar's twin in the sense they are innovating and disrupting classic software development, I think our continued relationship will be one of the keys to Polestar's success,\" adds Vesavuori.   \n\n---\n[1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2021/11/13/ev-share-of-china-passenger-car-market-more-than-tripled-to-nearly-19-in-october/?sh%3D104ff31b2c21&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1652516160991840&usg=AOvVaw2g4ebZTrSyGO52TpPwqGiK)\n",

The company's ethos— Pure Progressive Performance — is at the heart of its approach to all aspects of the business, from the cars it designs to the end-to-end customer experience it provides.\n\n### __The Challenge: Improving Chinese customer confidence, finding a strategic development partner, and ensuring highly-performant content delivery__\n\nFor automobile manufacturers, an effective digital infrastructure is central to both product performance and how customers perceive and interact with the manufacturer. Within the performance EV sector, Polestar has the mechanical pedigree, but wants to take its digital experience to the next level.   \n\n\"Polestar has a unique take on how to buy a car and it's very important to us to deliver on those expectations,\" explains Mikael Vesavuori, Cloud Software Architect and Technical Standards Lead at Polestar. \"Whether you purchase our cars online or visit one of the Polestar spaces, we tie together the physical and digital dimensions to provide a much richer retail and automotive encounter.\"\n\nOne way they achieve this is the Polestar Configurator, a central feature of Polestar's distinctive physical spaces. It is a media-rich digital and physical touchpoint that familiarizes buyers with vehicle configurations, options, and interior and exterior materials and trim. \n\nUnfortunately, the Polestar Configurator experienced performance and availability issues in China — a lucrative market where one in every five cars sold is an EV (1).\n\nAt the heart of the problem was Polestar's CDN provider, which had issues with the restrictive Chinese Internet infrastructure and connectivity problems with its global AWS network. The only solution was a partner that could overcome the latency, congestion and peering, and DNS issues that negatively affected customer perceptions of Polestar technology and the cars themselves.         \n\nIn addition to solving these issues, Polestar wanted a strategic partnership to aid along its software development roadmap. The company was developing a micro-front end architecture for its web presence that relied on multiple applications. These applications needed to interact seamlessly to provide a user experience that aligned with Polestar's brand objectives. \n\n\"We were looking for a proactive partner with developer experience, but we were sitting in meetings with vendors simply handing us documentation and saying, 'Here's how you can deal with the challenges you are facing,'\" says Johan Larsson, Technical Lead for the Polestar Platform Team.    \n\nFinally, as Polestar scaled its online and physical spaces internationally and began more proactively marketing its products, they wanted enterprise-class security and content delivery to ensure they remained performant in every imaginable scenario and market.\n\n### __The Cloudflare China Network provides world-class performance and reliability__\n\n\"It was a matter of perfect timing in a very poor situation,\" says Vesavuori, explaining Polestar's move to Cloudflare. With the current CDN partnership up for contract renewal and Chinese connectivity lagging, Polestar began researching to find the ideal solution partner. \n\n\"The list went from many names to very few,\" he explains. \"Only Cloudflare ticked all the boxes and met all of our absolute requirements for a dedicated China network — brand stability, proven reliability, and a very DevOps-oriented approach.\"\n\nAfter the switch, Polestar saw an immediate improvement in the performance of its on-site Configurator and web properties due to the Cloudflare China Network's partnership with China's largest Internet and cloud services provider, JD Cloud. The partnership provides Cloudflare clients with a geographically dispersed network presence in major cities across China to serve their static and dynamic content, and unrestricted access to Cloudflare serverless computing. \n\n\"With our previous vendor, everything was difficult to configure and troubleshoot,\" says Larsson. \"With Cloudflare, it just worked like magic. We instantly saw performance — our Chinese pages were as accessible as any other page, anywhere in the world.\"  \n\n\"Our most important gain in the move to Cloudflare China was the improvement across the board in predictability and stability. It always works,\" Vesavuori adds. \"On the customer side, that ability to deliver reliable technology ensures trust.\"\n\n### __A Super Bowl performant win with Workers and the Cloudflare global network__   \n\nIn addition to adopting the Cloudflare China Network, Polestar moved away from its underperforming cloud services and CDN  provider, switched to the Cloudflare global network for content delivery worldwide, and began web development using Cloudflare Workers serverless edge computing services.\n\nWhen it came to development, Polestar was able to rapidly migrate its entire micro-front-end architecture and applications to Workers, the Cloudflare serverless platform for running applications and code on the network edge. Cloudflare documentation, in addition to its strong online community and consultations, demos, and walkthroughs from proactive Cloudflare support teams further accelerated the transition. \n\nAnother win for the company was the ability to easily test its releases using Workers, a process Polestar previously found tedious and time-consuming. The time saved freed up Polestar's technical teams to focus on core business goals.   \n\n\"Workers was the most compatible with the tech we use to develop our applications — other vendor's solutions were abstracted in a way that made it difficult to get a sense of what would happen when we made changes,\" Larsson explains. \"Using Workers, we have granular control of everything and we can easily test to ensure our setup is correct before we release anything.\" \n\nOn the content delivery side, Polestar put the Cloudflare global network to the test when it aired the ['No Compromises'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QI0VzbkHk) commercial during Super Bowl 2022. The advertisement resulted in over 150,000 website visits — a traffic increase of almost 500 percent — in the two minutes after it aired. The site also saw an increase in long-tail traffic of around 15% for weeks following the tv commercial. \n\n\"Immediately after airing the Super Bowl commercial, viewers completed over 2000 configurations. We also saw a sales record for cars sold post event without fatal errors or us even flinching,\" says Vesavuori. \"Without Cloudflare as part of our core infrastructure, that could not have happened.\" \n\nWith 99.7% of its traffic served from the Cloudflare cache — up from a maximum of 80% percent with its previous providers — the Polestar network is faster and more [resilient](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/) than ever. Cloudflare image resizing and optimization further lighten Polestar's bandwidth requirements, increase performance, and render its graphically-intensive website responsive on any device. \n\nLooking forward, Polestar intends to strengthen its partnership with Cloudflare and explore new services. The company is looking into [Cloudflare Stream](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/) for its video storage, encoding, and adaptive bitrate playback, in addition to digging deeper into Workers KV, the Cloudflare edge key-value-data storage solution.\n\n\"Cloudflare is taking steps that disrupt the traditional marketplace. It's very interesting to follow their emerging services and figure out how they will improve our next generation of applications on the edge,\" says Larsson.\n\n\"Cloudflare is Polestar's twin in the sense they are innovating and disrupting classic software development, I think our continued relationship will be one of the keys to Polestar's success,\" adds Vesavuori.   \n\n---\n[1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2021/11/13/ev-share-of-china-passenger-car-market-more-than-tripled-to-nearly-19-in-october/?sh%3D104ff31b2c21&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1652516160991840&usg=AOvVaw2g4ebZTrSyGO52TpPwqGiK)\n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare solutions enable PayNet to easily and securely adopt a secure, resilient modern cloud computing model",
						"longDescription": "## __PayNet transitions to a cloud-based computing model to further its mission of making electronic payments more accessible in Malaysia__ \n\nPayments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (PayNet) is the operator of Malaysia's shared payments system and shared financial market infrastructures created following the merger of MyClear and MEPS on 1 Aug 2017. In line with the developmental objective of providing inclusive and efficient payments to Malaysia's financial ecosystem, PayNet's shareholders do not receive dividends, and surplus profits are instead reinvested to ensure that the nation's financial market infrastructures and payment ecosystems are resilient, competitive, and accessible to all. Services provided span almost every payment type, from large value to retail payments and from securities settlement to ATMs to bills pay, to ACH. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the country's central bank, is PayNet's single largest shareholder, with 11 other financial institutions in the country holding equal shares.\n\nPayNet operates the MyDebit domestic payment card program, with over 47 million cards in circulation. Malaysian consumers can use the MyDebit card to access automated teller machines (ATMs) and make purchases both online and at brick-and-mortar merchants.\n\nAdditionally, PayNet is the developer and operator of the DuitNow service which comprising of DuitNow QR is which is Malaysia's interoperable standard for QR codes and DuitNow Transfer where consumers can instantly transfer funds using their mobile number, national ID card number, or other proxy options. \n\n### __Challenge: Optimize security while transitioning from mainframes to a modern cloud-based data environment__ \n\nThe Malaysian financial services industry still depends on legacy technologies, such as mainframe systems. For this reason, PayNet traditionally built private connections between itself and financial institutions -- meaning that the connections were not through the open internet. \n\nHowever, as cloud computing became the technology of choice over the past several years, electronic payment providers emerged. PayNet had to transition to internet-based connections, using a technology called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), to continue serving banks and furthering its mission to promote electronic payments in Malaysia.\n\nThis transition from private connectivity to APIs made it necessary for PayNet to enhance its security using a methodology called Zero Trust, which would allow PayNet to continue to provide secure and trusted transactions. PayNet also needed to ensure that their API connections could handle spikes in usage, and they needed to protect them from distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyberattacks. In a DDoS attack, cybercriminals flood a website or application with \"junk\" traffic from multiple sources, slowing the site or app, or even bringing it down completely.\n\nPrior to deploying Cloudflare, PayNet used an older web application firewall (WAF) to block cyberattacks, with DDoS protection provided by their internet service provider. However, the WAF was complex and time-consuming to configure and manage, and their DDoS protection was insufficient to meet PayNet's needs. Additionally, neither service scaled well to handle traffic spikes, nor did either service support a modern Zero Trust security model. \n\nPayNet needed easy-to-use, scalable, cloud-based solutions that supported a Zero Trust security model. PayNet also wanted greater visibility into their web traffic, so that they could monitor where security threats were coming from. After evaluating both Cloudflare and a competing vendor, PayNet chose Cloudflare because of its ease of use, pace of innovation, transparency, customer-centric approach, and competitive pricing.\n\n### __PayNet ensures availability of services with Cloudflare Magic Transit and the Cloudflare WAF__\n\nCloudflare Magic Transit is a cloud-based security tool that uses the Cloudflare global network to protect against DDoS attacks while also accelerating network traffic. Using Magic Transit, PayNet now mitigates all DDoS attacks within minutes, ensuring that its services are always available. Magic Transit is also more scalable and easier to use than PayNet's previous DDoS solution, and it provides PayNet with valuable data on its web traffic.\n\n\"Cloudflare Magic Transit's scale, dashboard analytics, and dynamic capabilities are highly valuable,\" says Preman Padmanabhan, senior principal engineer. \"We get immediate attack alerts, and we can see where the attacks are coming from.\"\n\nMagic Transit includes a feature called Magic Firewall, which allows PayNet to easily block web traffic coming from specific sources or using specific protocols. Previously, PayNet had to contact its ISP and request that they perform the block. Not having to contact Cloudflare to perform this type of task is easier and much faster for PayNet.\n\nUsing the Cloudflare WAF analytics, PayNet can rapidly pinpoint the root causes of problems and resolve them quickly, ensuring that its services remain fast and secure. Additionally, PayNet's engineering team can focus on internal projects instead of getting bogged down with security issues.\n\nBy applying these modernizing tools, PayNet was able to integrate an end-to-end solution for non-sovereign operations and develop a modern sovereign operations platform. Further, this new infrastructure enables PayNet staff members to work together like an integrated system, with everyone striving to reach a common goal. There is a synergy of ideas, actions, and solutions when people come together to improve productivity and efficiency.\n\n\"We have a small security team, and our engineers need to spend their time on product development,\" explains Kenny Tse, Head of Information Technology Security. \"Cloudflare has the security expertise to maintain firewall rules that are much more current and comprehensive than what we could have come up with.\"\n\nPayNet uses Cloudflare's analytics to gain actionable insights into its web traffic and security posture. PayNet uses these insights to both optimize security and ensure that its services scale rapidly to accommodate increasing demand. PayNet's application developers use this data to perform capacity planning and optimize application response times.\n\n\"Cloudflare helps us see what types of attacks we're getting, take proactive measures to prevent them, and share relevant data with all internal team members,\" Gomez says. \n\nPayNet also uses Cloudflare's analytics to simplify compliance reporting and demonstrate to its customers that it adheres to the highest levels of security. \n\n\"We use Cloudflare's analytics and reporting to prove that our security isn't just sufficient, but significantly better than what we had previously, helping us remain compliant,\" Padmanabhan explains.\n\n### __PayNet uses mTLS for an upcoming product that will greatly expand electronic payments in Malaysia__\n\nMutual TLS (mTLS) ensures that traffic between a client and server is both secure and trusted in both directions. PayNet deployed mTLS in preparation for a new online e-commerce service with Malaysia's Debit Card Scheme, which began rolling out in July 2021. In Malaysia, the ability to make online payments is largely restricted to consumers who have online bank accounts. PayNet's new service will make it easier for more Malaysians to purchase goods and services digitally, even if they don't have an online banking account.\n\n\"A Zero Trust implementation is a marathon, not a sprint,\" Tse points out. \"By helping us with user authentication on our new service, Cloudflare gets us one step closer to our ultimate goal of a full-on Zero Trust architecture.\"\n\nThe PayNet team also appreciates the ease of having an integrated set of security solutions provided by one single vendor.\n\nThese added services and Zero Trust solutions further secure PayNet's infrastructure, which provides an added layer of security for their customers who rely on PayNet every day. \n",

						"longDescription": "## __UK Government agency leverages Cloudflare to modernize communications with a solution of significant national importance__\n\nA UK Government agency needed a digital platform where users could engage digitally. They partnered with CDS, an agency that enables strategic change in organizations and businesses to create and build better services to meet the evolving needs of customers, employees and citizens. \n\n### __Challenge: Ensure secure remote access to the solution of national importance and protect it from malicious bots__\n\nCDS manages the back end of the platform, including security. Initially, remote access to the solution of national importance by a UK Government agency and CDS employees was protected by firewalls and other internal measures, but these were difficult and time-consuming to manage. CDS didn't want to use a VPN, because VPNs are complicated to deploy and manage, and difficult for end users to use.\n\nAvailability and performance were especially important, as was protecting the platform from high volumes of malicious bot traffic, which would degrade its performance and incur significant bandwidth charges.\n\nDue to previous positive experiences with Cloudflare products, CDS deployed several Cloudflare solutions to address these challenges:\n\n- __Access__, which enables remote users to securely connect to internal resources\n- __Bot Management__, which uses global threat intelligence and machine learning to block malicious bot traffic\n- __Tunnel__, a secure tunneling solution that establishes a private connection between internal applications and the Cloudflare edge\n\n### __Cloudflare Access ensures secure remote connections to the solution of national importance platform__\n\nCDS was able to configure Cloudflare Access and implement the solution within a few hours.\n\n\"We didn't have a single issue deploying Cloudflare Access, and our clients love how easy it is for them to use,\" says CDS. \"We feel really lucky that we found Access when we did, which in our experience has proven itself superior to other similar solutions.\"\n\nThe team working on the platform share Access seats, which enables secure authentication from any modern browser to the web-based solution they have developed. For this use case, end users did not need to install any endpoint software, making deployment straightforward and streamlined. \n\n\"Cloudflare Access provided this solution with secure remote access right out of the box,\" said a spokesperson from the team at CDS. \"It's very easy for the UK government agency to use, and it takes very little time for CDS to maintain. Once you have Access set up, it just works.\" \n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management guards the solution against malicious bot attacks, while Tunnel ensures world-class performance__\n\nAfter deploying Cloudflare Bot Management, malicious bot attacks on the platform dropped. This decrease improved site performance, saved money on bandwidth costs, and provided highly detailed security analytics that were previously unavailable. The UK government agency can use these analytics to better understand the types of bot attacks they're facing.\n\nThe Bot Management machine learning engine is amazing, and the analytics provide the client with valuable security data that they can use to implement proactive security measures, such as blocking problematic IP addresses.\n\nCDS also deployed Cloudflare Tunnel to further optimize performance on the platform.\n\nCloudflare is integral to the success of this UK government platform. As a solution of national importance the platform is required to deliver consistent, secure, high-performance to users.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Otrium moves fashion forward with Cloudflare Zero Trust, application performance, and serverless solutions__\n\nFounded in 2015, Amsterdam-based [Otrium](https://www.otrium.com/) believes all clothing should be worn. Their purpose is to target excess inventory, a major sustainability issue in the fashion industry. \"One in 10 pieces of clothing manufactured goes unsold, gets sent to warehouses, and eventually ends up in landfills,\" explains Leander Sikma, Otrium CTO. \"Otrium works to address this by giving designer and contemporary fashion brands such as Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein, REISS, Filippa K, Adidas, and Puma an online managed marketplace that connects millions of registered members with their end-of-season collections.\"\n\nTo increase marketability, Otrium provides their partners' collections with refreshed descriptions and improved photography. They also harness AI to match inventory on the platform with buyer preferences. In line with their sustainable ethos, the company even repairs returned items to perfect condition in order to give them a second chance on their platform. \n\nAdding further value with their unique [Data-Made Fashion concept](https://us.otrium.com/blog/otrium-pioneers-data-made-fashion-to-eliminate-unsold-inventory-in-fashion), Otrium uses their partners' data to take the guesswork out of creating new collections, reduce overstocked fabric, and reproduce popular items. With over 3.7 million members and 400 brand partnerships, Otrium is a win-win proposition for smart consumers and fashion brands alike.    \n\n### __Challenge: Providing strict internal controls while enabling a frictionless shopping experience around the world__\n\nOtrium is a 100% cloud-based enterprise with a global presence that serves over 20 markets worldwide. It has an equally diversified [remote-first ](https://www.otrium.com/blog/otrium-hq-cloud)workforce that ranges across Western and Eastern Europe, the US and UK, Asia and South Africa. As a result, the company needed to provide employees with safe, uninterrupted, location-independent access to internal systems while continuing to provide a friction-free user experience. \n\n\"It is vital we maintain a reliable IT and security infrastructure,\" says Sikma. \"Our employees, partners, and customers rely on our technology.\"\n\nOtrium initially depended on third-party platforms for hosting and security, but that proved both problematic and inflexible, especially as they extended their global reach. \"As we expanded, we quickly outgrew those services,\" Sikma explains. Otrium needed more control over their technical infrastructure and the ability to optimize further to meet their technical, security, and business goals. Cloudflare provided a flexible solution that fulfilled Otrium's requirements as the business continued to evolve.\n\n### __Immediate success with minimal effort using Cloudflare security and performance solutions__\n\nIn 2018, Otrium moved their servers to the cloud and selected Cloudflare to enable enhanced  content delivery. \"It was a logical choice — in some cases, we were already indirectly using Cloudflare through our legacy vendors, and it was a performance and security solution familiar to most of the team,\" says Sikma regarding the rationale behind the switch.  \n\nThe company began with standard security and performance features like Cloudflare DNS, cache, SSL/TLS, and managed rules. \"We had immediate success with minimal effort. Cloudflare tools like Rocket Loader immediately reduced our front-end load times to 50% of what our existing tech stack was taking,\" Sikma says. \"Today, with our more complex single-page architecture and the performance enhancement features Cloudflare offers, we continue to see clear benefits.\"\n\n### __Blocking DDoS and bot traffic with Cloudflare Security Center__\n\nAs Otrium became more established and their architecture evolved, their security requirements also shifted focus. \"DDoS, bots, and individual or automated security penetration are currently our biggest external security concerns,\" says Sikma. [Cloudflare application security solutions](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) like WAF, DDoS protection, Rate Limiting, and Bot Management keep the Otrium site running smoothly and securely.\n\n\"With the launch of the [Cloudflare Security Center](https://blog.cloudflare.com/security-center/), our security architects can easily monitor attack surfaces, pinpoint shortcomings, and reduce vulnerabilities,\" says Sikma. \"It allows us to make continuous improvements on a daily basis.\" \n\nCloudflare currently blocks thousands of significant automated threats to the Otrium platform monthly. \"Since we implemented Cloudflare across all of our 30+ domains and subdomains, our cybersecurity has massively improved,\" says Sikma. \"Cloudflare default features make running a safer infrastructure easy, but you see its true power when you start optimizing rules and functionality to suit your business needs.\"\n\n### __Flexible Cloudflare solutions meets specific business needs__\n\nOnline fashion retailing is a highly visual endeavor. As a result, Otrium has a vast, ever-changing library of product images that needs to be [100% optimized](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) on a range of devices. In addition, with their multi-country expansion, Otrium needs to automatically direct community members to location- and language-specific sites and payment gateways from their root domain. Both requirements are supported by Cloudflare functionality. \n\n\"Because everything we do happens in the cloud, Otrium relies heavily on edge computing features like IP geolocation and image optimizations,\" says Sikma, \"Cloudflare's serverless solution makes many of our security challenges easy to resolve, saving us both time and money.\" \n\n### __Cloudflare Zero Trust secures SaaS and internal application access for Otrium's global workforce__\n\nOtrium also deploys Cloudflare to protect their globally distributed workforce. Specifically, Cloudflare Zero Trust secures employees, partners, and vendors accessing corporate applications with identity-aware, granular policies.\n\nOtrium currently has employees, vendors, and partners across 4 continents using Cloudflare to authenticate internally-hosted apps and SaaS apps like Google Workspace.\n\n\"Cloudflare Zero Trust provides an extra layer of security to every one of our internal applications that would be exposed on the web,\" says Sikma. \"The initial configuration only takes a couple of minutes, and you can quickly establish custom rules for each of your applications.\"\n\nAs next steps to build out their Zero Trust approach, Otrium intends to leverage Cloudflare's forward proxy capabilities to secure a wider range of SaaS and internal apps, including those hosted in private IP spaces.\n\n\"Due to its ease of implementation and high level of configurability, Cloudflare offers many use cases that suit Otrium from both the end user and technical practitioner perspective,\" says Sikma.\n\nFor Otrium, the support Cloudflare offers is as important as the performance it brings. \"The Cloudflare Account team has been really helpful to us,\" says Sikma. \"They go above and beyond our expectations — they have even helped us conduct a custom proof of concept and collaborate on the product roadmap to solve application access use cases.\"\n\nFor the future, Otrium plans to continue their security modernization, increase their international reach footprint, and expand their internal security awareness training, underpinned by solutions such as Zero Trust, Cloudflare Tunnel and Workers.\n\n\"As we continue to grow, Otrium will leverage Cloudflare further to keep our cloud infrastructure safe and secure,\" Sikma concludes. \n",

Having had previous experience with Cloudflare, Wethenew decided to set up Cloudflare Bot Management as a first step, before moving on to secure their traffic with Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF).\n\n### __Cloudflare provides large-scale data protection and bot management__\n\nThe challenge for Wethenew was twofold; they needed to protect their market intelligence from competitors while also preventing abuse of the \"sellers\" part of their marketplace.\n\nAfter implementing Cloudflare's easy-to-use platform, with its DDOS protection, WAF, and Bot Management solutions, Wethenew was able to add a strong security layer on their website.\n\nPowered by data from millions of Internet properties on Cloudflare's network, Bot Management responds in real time, making the technical team's job much easier. This allows the Wethenew team to spend less time fighting bots and more time working on business critical projects to provide their customers with a better experience.\n\nAccording to Raux, \"We felt the benefits of Cloudflare immediately. By deploying their app security solutions, we were able to keep legitimate bots and analyze behavior on our network more comprehensively than ever before.\"\n\n### __Quick and efficient deployment__\n\nWethenew turned to Cloudflare because they needed a solution that was quick and easy to deploy. Now, Wethenew's technical team can focus on new projects, rather than dealing with security incidents.\n\nMoreover, Wethenew now has precise analytics on security events that occur on its website and can act swiftly - saving themselves time and increasing employee efficiency. \n\nAs Raux explains, \"The speed and ease with which you deploy Cloudflare is a real plus. By working together, we've been able to meet all of our goals and optimize security throughout our organization. We look forward to working with Cloudflare as we continue to grow.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare empowers NCR to fight sophisticated payment fraud and protect customers across multiple industries__\n\nWith a storied history of innovation, NCR has been at the forefront of retail systems for more than 100 years. From the earliest cash registers to today's contactless checkout, NCR is a global leader in software for retail, hospitality, payments and banking. A customer-first focus and a strong foundation of information security have helped NCR earn the trust of its customers and their consumers. \n\n### __Keep payment fraud at bay__\n\nWhether you are buying the perfect puffer jacket, picking up takeout from your favorite restaurant or buying crypto at an ATM, chances are NCR is behind your digital interaction. \n\n\"At NCR, our mission is to convert daily transactions into meaningful relationships with our customers,\" says Alok Kumar, CISO, Retail & Payments at NCR.\n\nBut as the pandemic accelerated digital transformation of sectors such as banking, retail and restaurants, so has online fraud. As the threat of cyberattacks increases, NCR has continued to advance its digital protections that could otherwise chip away at customer confidence and result in higher costs for everyone. \n\n### __Protect the digital experience__\n\nNCR relies on a portfolio of Cloudflare solutions to protect its retail, hospitality, payments and banking customers from online fraud and business disruption while providing a better consumer experience. With Cloudflare, NCR can help guard against brute-force attacks, malicious bots and DDoS attacks. \n\n\"Cloudflare was really attractive because it provides really sophisticated controls against attacks but does so in the cloud,\" says Bob Varnadoe, CISO at NCR. \"The security team isn't responsible for managing infrastructure, so they are able to focus on doing higher value security work.\"\n\nCloudflare Bot Management Service enables NCR to detect and block malicious bots at scale, helping to protect customers against automated attacks and lowering fraud chargebacks from payment card companies. \"When we deployed Cloudflare, we were able to prevent 80 to 90 percent of brute-force attacks–and that was right out of the box.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare SSL for SaaS, NCR can provide its banking, retail, payments and hospitality customers with a branded visitor experience while extending security and performance benefits. Cloudflare Web Application Firewall offers protection for NCR's customers against expanding attack surfaces, including advanced malware, zero-day vulnerabilities and the growing risk of attacks on APIs. \n\nCloudflare helps NCR enhance software supply chain security, a dramatically growing risk. Cloudflare Page Shield gives NCR's IT team visibility into third-party scripts and libraries running on applications to gain insight into malicious behavior and protect customer interactions from attacks that rely on compromised third-party software.\n\n\"Hackers are always trying to bypass protections and Cloudflare continues to step up,\" said Kumar. \n\n### __Growing service revenue__\n\nFoundational security defenses are built into NCR's offerings. Customers at the highest risk of credit card tumbling, credential stuffing or other brute-force attacks can add on a premium security service that offers continuous protection. \n\nOften overlooked, credit card tumbling attacks are a costly assault. In this scam, criminals create possible credit card and debit card numbers, along with the CVV, and test these fake numbers against legitimate websites. When hackers get a working number, they sell it to the highest bidder on the dark web. Repeated attempts drive up NCR's penalty chargebacks from payment card issuers.\n\n\"If a customer gets impacted, we provide the initial brute-force protection at no charge for several weeks,\" says Kumar. \"After seeing the additional insights, customers can opt to continue on with the premium service.\" \n\nThe service leverages Cloudflare Bot Management Service as well as Cloudflare Workers and Page Rules to run serverless code that stops the credit card tumbling attacks. Workers enables deployment of service workers with exceptional performance, reliability and scale, while Page Rules trigger action when an in-progress attack is detected. \n\n### __Advanced workload and endpoint with innovative integrations__\n\nNCR leverages Cloudflare for greater resilience against advanced threats through innovative integration with NCR's preferred endpoint and workload protection platform. \n\n\"NCR operates in a highly-regulated environment, and we have worked with Cloudflare to develop an innovative way to protect our servers at the highest levels while meeting industry compliance mandates,\" says Kumar. \n\n### __A trusted partnership__\n\nNCR invented the electronic cash register, the magnetic card stripe and self-checkout machines. The payments pioneer continues to be a technology leader, protecting its customers from escalating cybersecurity risk and a loss of consumer confidence in today's digital world.\n\n\"Cloudflare was probably one of the easiest decisions we've ever made,\" said Varnadoe. \"Cloudflare has created a lot of value very quickly for our organization.\" \n",

						"shortDescription": "CARS24 uses Cloudflare to protect its customers from malicious bots and DDoS attacks while providing peace of mind to both buyers and sellers in the pre-owned car market",
						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps the CARS24 ecommerce platform stay one step ahead of DDoS attacks, data scrapers, and appointment hoarding bots__\n\nIndia's growing professional class aspires more than ever toward the safety and convenience of private transportation. Many car buyers, however, are simply unwilling to pay the premium new car prices that COVID-19 uncertainties, global supply chain issues, and a shortfall of new vehicles demand. That is where CARS24 enters the picture. Pioneering a unique dual C2B and B2C sales strategy, CARS24 demystifies the sale of pre-owned cars by offering sellers fair valuations and buyers quality assurance, warranties, and financing. \n\nThe timing couldn't be better  — [India's pre-owned vehicle market is currently valued at US $34.1 billion](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/india-used-car-market), with projections estimating that number will double to over US $70 billion by 2027 as other regional markets follow suit. Valued at $5 billion, this privately-owned, 2015 startup has 205 branches across India, a presence in 203 Indian cities, and a network of 10,000+ channel partners. With the Indian market well in hand, CARS24 has expanded to the UAE, Australia, and Thailand and has plans underway to further their global reach. \n\n### __Challenge: Ensuring secure, frictionless transactions in a fast-paced international ecosystem under attack__\n\nAs a thriving autotech ecommerce platform, CARS24 depends on security, stability, and availability to ensure frictionless transactions in a market fraught with buyer and seller insecurity.\n\n\"Convenience and consumer peace of mind are the most important services we provide,\" explains Marut Singh, the CARS24 CTO overseeing the company's tech stack, application architecture, and security. \"Although the process looks very simple, there are many underlying complexities,\" he adds, referring to consumer confidence as well as the regulations, logistics, and systems required to evaluate, acquire, refurbish, photograph, and finance the purchase of each vehicle.\n\n\"Our infrastructure must always be up and running because our customers won't wait. There is a limited supply of vehicles and a lot of people interested in each car. Delays mean lost opportunities.\"\n\nWith a three-person SecOps team doing double duty handling compliance and multiple internal and external domains used by their channel partners and customers around the world, CARS24 had multiple concerns.\n\n\"We were facing DDoS attacks, data scrapers, and cumbersome certificate management across all our web properties as they grew in number,\" summarizes Singh. \"We wanted a security layer that could protect our web properties and APIs without adding significant overhead.\"\n\nIn their quest for a security solution, CARS24 tried several vendors before Cloudflare, but none of them ticked all the boxes.\n\n\"The competitor with the largest comparable footprint and service offering to Cloudflare had a user interface that was too clunky and outdated to use efficiently,\" Singh recalls. \"Another vendor lacked Indian servers — the nearest was in Singapore — and added significant latency to our infrastructure. The last solution we looked at was too complicated to configure effectively and had immature pricing policies.\"\n\nCARS24 wanted an advanced security solution that delivered everything on their list — ease of implementation and configuration, maintenance, performance, local server coverage, prompt support, and value for money. \n\n### __Cloudflare ensures seamless WAF implementation and peak-level DDoS protection__\n\nCARS24 began their journey with Cloudflare in 2019 by moving to protect their domains with the Web Application Firewall (WAF).\n\n\"It really wasn't difficult. Integrating Cloudflare with our newer domains was just a matter of changing name servers,\" says Singh.\n\nMigrating CARS24's legacy domains and their complex load balancing requirements proved to be almost equally straightforward. With Cloudflare CNAME flattening, CARS24 was able to provide immediate access to edge services.\n\n\"When we used competing solutions, we encountered significant implementation and configuration issues with changes taking a long time to reflect,\" Singh relates. \"What took us three days with a previous provider, Cloudflare accomplished in an hour. Overall, the Cloudflare interface is much simpler, and certificates and configuration changes to the WAF propagate in minutes.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare, the CARS24 team can finally address their most pressing security concern: DDoS attacks. With their early vendors, CARS24 was particularly vulnerable on weekends when customer activity was highest and their technical staff least available.\n\n\"Saturdays and Sundays are our busiest days and, in the past, the site has failed due to a DDoS attack during this critical period,\" says Singh.\n\nNow, CARS24 can configure robust DDoS attack prevention with a combination of the Cloudflare WAF, Managed Ruleset, OWASP ModSecurity Core Ruleset, and their own custom rules.\n\nCARS24 also uses Cloudflare country-based IP blocking to avert unwanted volume attacks and ensure their sites stay up.\n\n\"There is no strategic value in allowing traffic that originates in problem countries when it couldn't possibly come from a potential customer,\" says Singh.\n\nDirectly from the dashboard, Cloudflare filters out questionable requests and secures the CARS24 websites, applications, and networks against DDoS attacks without compromising performance or inconveniencing legitimate customer traffic.\n\n\"In the most severe instances, we can rely on the Cloudflare cache to serve our users even if our underlying infrastructure is not available,\" Singh adds. \"It gives us an advantage for sure.\" \n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management frees up customer appointment times and reduces unwanted traffic and unnecessary overheads__\n\nAnother pain point for CARS24 was \"hoarding\" bots that create false bookings and disrupt the company's vehicle acquisition workflows.\n\nSingh explains, \"There is a fixed number of bookings our vehicle inspection partners can handle. When a bot blocks those appointment slots, we can't accept real bookings which means we can't buy cars.\"\n\nCloudflare's advanced rate limiting protects CARS24 from unusual activity like excessive login attempts or repeated API calls.    \n\nData scrapers were also a threat to user personal information and CARS24 public domain data that needed to be curbed. In addition to the security risk, the unwanted traffic was affecting CARS24' bottom line.\n\n\"Whether or not traffic is genuine, we bear the costs of upgrading our infrastructure to serve it,\" says Singh. \"Useless traffic also skews our analytics and puts us in danger of focusing our marketing and other initiatives on the wrong audience.\"\n\nWith the granular control Cloudflare gives CARS24 over their traffic, Singh and his team can rapidly recognize spurious activity and automatically block, challenge, or redirect threats without interrupting service or staffing around the clock to manually monitor systems. \n\n\"Simply put, Cloudflare identifies and mitigates risks to our ecosystem that rogue elements want to exploit,\" says Singh, indicating that Cloudflare had stopped 44,000 threats in the last 24 hours. \"We couldn't build that in-house and expect to get it right. Discovering an attack and knowing Cloudflare has already stopped it gives us peace of mind.\"      \n\n### __Non-disruptive legacy code replacement on the edge with Cloudflare Workers__\n\nCloudflare Workers enables CARS24 to deploy serverless code on the edge of a powerful global network, [minimizing latency](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) and removing on-premise infrastructure dependencies. Singh explains how Workers empowers CARS24 development teams to update their legacy PHP codebase to React.js without service interruptions or laborious update procedures: \n\n\"Workers and advanced routing mesh well with our development roadmap. We are changing our tech stack and converting our backlog page by page using complex logic to direct users to our new code. It would be very difficult to do from inside our own web servers, but it is very easy to do with Workers on the edge.\"             \n\nAs CARS24 takes the business even further afield, Workers features are likely to become a more critical part of their infrastructure.\n\n\"In addition, we are exploring the use cases of Cloudflare Tunnel and Argo Smart Routing as the CARS24 global portfolio continues to expand,\" says Singh. The company is also investigating caching their static content — including images of their entire automobile inventory — on Cloudflare's global network.   \n\nAfter three years, CARS24 remains impressed by the availability of the dedicated Cloudflare CSM and CSE teams working to meet their needs.\n\n\"Cloudflare is such a technical product, having immediate access to their support team's expertise to ensure everything is configured for maximum performance, answer a quick question, or get on a call to help us explore a new product or feature is very reassuring,\" says Singh. \"As their customer, I'm confident Cloudflare will continue to support CARS24 as we grow.\" \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps Holly Technology optimize security and performance across Southeast Asia__\n\nGuided by their \"go global\" strategy, Holly Technology was established in Hong Kong in 2017. The company provides network and cloud architecture solution services as well as IDC and cloud computing services for a wide customer base in Asia. In addition to providing hosting services and cloud computing architecture, they help customers build their own global networks. \n\n### __Challenge: Network congestion impedes dynamic content delivery to users in Southeast Asia__\n\nThe majority of Holly Tech's customer base is concentrated in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and many of them run online gaming platforms. For these customers, reaching an online user base - one that spans many countries around the world - can be challenging. Network congestion and latency often impacts the speed at which content is delivered to the users, which would cause game lags and ultimately drive players to seek out alternative platforms.  To remedy this issue and prevent it from happening in the future, Holly Tech began the search for a partnership that would solve these problems and allow them to better serve their customers. \n\n### __Cloudflare's global network improves speed and reliability for customers around the world__\n\nAfter searching for a vendor that could not only help solve their latency issues, but also tailor efficient and budget friendly services for their customers, Holly Tech decided on Cloudflare's application services solutions. \n\nWith Cloudflare's global cloud network, Holly Tech's customers were able to create automated workflows, fine-tune control over content caching and purchasing, and determine congestion in real time in order to route network traffic through the fastest and most reliable network path. Now, Holly Tech's customers don't have to worry about traffic spikes or network congestion slowing down their sites, helping improve their reputation and relationship with online users.\n\n\"The difference before and after using Cloudflare was like night and day. Their global network provided our customers with relief and the chance to give their users a more enjoyable gaming experience,\" said Jessie Chen, Holly Technology's Product and Service Manager. \n\n### __Cloudflare application security tools block billions of attacks__\n\nIn addition to optimizing site performance, Cloudflare helps Holly Tech safeguard their customers with integrated security tools, including Advanced DDoS Protection, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Rate Limiting. \n\nWith online threats becoming an increasingly prevalent issue, Cloudflare detects and blocks more than 20 billion malicious attacks for Holly Tech's customers each month. Now DDoS attacks, malicious bots, and other threats are no longer a concern. Holly Tech's staff is now able to spend less time on mitigating attacks, and more time on product development. \n\nThe combination of Cloudflare's application performance and security tools greatly enhanced the service Holly Tech is able to provide its customers, and they look forward to a long continued partnership. \n\n\"Cloudflare has delivered our customers in Hong Kong and Taiwan the high-speed and secure experience their users in Southeast Asia were previously lacking.

						"shortDescription": "Koo partners with Cloudflare to augment data security as downloads increase",
						"longDescription": "## __As the Indian multilingual microblogging platform scales past 30 million downloads, enhances creator happiness and provides users with a safe and reliable interface, Koo uses Cloudflare to secure the API endpoints, mitigate threats and prevent bot attacks__\n\nLaunched in March 2020 to empower internet users to express themselves online in their mother tongue, Koo became India's go-to micro-blogging platform by addressing the core internet use case of 'expression'. Today, with over 30 million downloads and growing, the platform is riding the wave of India's recent widespread mobile phone adoption and universal Internet access. In a country with over one billion people that speak over 22 official languages, Koo gives users outside the English-speaking community an online voice.\n\nKoo invites users to come online to share their thoughts and opinions in a language of their choice, engage with distinct linguistic communities, and celebrate events of regional, national and international importance on the platform. Koo's innovative features such as the multi-lingual Koo (MLK) enable the real-time translation of a message across the 10 languages currently offered by the platform, while retaining the sentiment attached to the original message. This feature truly democratizes the voice of users by enabling them to reach out to speakers of other languages, thus amplifying their outreach. Koo also serves a growing volume of users and user-generated content at the national and local levels as more personalities, media outlets, and regional adopters come on board.\n\n\"We grow by moving forward and expanding our services based on user feedback,\" explains Phaneesh Gururaj, Chief Technology Officer, Koo.\n\n### __Challenge: Securing a newly-developed and rapidly-expanding social media platform__\n\nKoo's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team faced the task of keeping an API-intensive, largely-unsecured new platform and their users safe while improving performance and enhancing their Android and iOS app and browser experience. Then there was the urgent issue of scaling up to meet overwhelming demand. \n\n\"As Koo started getting popular across India, we saw a sudden surge in our API traffic. We quickly had to ensure all things related to security were tightened; right caching strategies and policies were put in place, API level throttling was configured - all this had to be done on a war footing,\" says Gururaj.\n\nKoo needed a flexible and secure content delivery solution they could implement out-of-the-box.\n\n### __A seamless Cloudflare implementation, under pressure__\n\nKoo adopted Cloudflare within their first six months of operation. The company  based their decision on the recommendations of their network partners. \n\nDespite the Koo team's limited exposure to the Cloudflare product suite and the pressure of the platform's rapidly growing subscriber base, integrating Cloudflare services with Koo's existing infrastructure was a smooth and seamless process.\n\n\"With the support of the Cloudflare team, we were able to achieve our objectives and secured our infra in a week,\" says Gururaj. \"After that, they worked with us on our back-end migration to establish the best security infrastructure and security best practices.\"\n\nWith the system locked down, the team was available to continue its development arc and implement additional Cloudflare features. \n\n### __Cloudflare WAF and Bot Management ensure API security and block impersonation and emulation attacks__\n\nKoo leans heavily on APIs to do everything from posting live user content and language-pair translations to processing video uploads on the fly. With their APIs exposed to the Internet, Koo was vulnerable to DDoS, daisy-chain, and zero-day attacks. The company needed visibility into the sources of the attacks and the ability to block them before they could do damage.\n\nCloudflare gave Koo the security and insight it lacked.\n\n\"Over a 30-day period, Cloudflare automatically blocks around 120 million malicious payloads for us,\" says Gururaj. \"Using Cloudflare, we can analyze harmful traffic patterns and fine-tune our bot management and WAF rules. When the patterns show malicious traffic coming from a specific country, we can block that, too.\"\n\n\"We work on a continuous basis to ensure our user data is secure and protected as we provide users with a genuine, safe and reliable experience,\" says Gururaj.\n\nCloudflare maintains customer trust by protecting Koo users from credential stuffing, emulation, and impersonation attacks. Thanks to Cloudflare Managed Rulesets and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) threat protection, Koo APIs are always safeguarded from threats — whether users access them via their browser or mobile device.\n\n### __Eliminating high overage fees with Cloudflare Rate Limiting__\n\nWhere Koo APIs need to remain open and available, the company relies on Cloudflare Rate Limiting. A prime example of this is the SMS one-time password (OTP) APIs Koo uses to verify users' identities when they log in, or sign up for an account.\n\n\"We want our users to experience the least amount of friction when they use the app, but SMS APIs are quite vulnerable,\" says Gururaj. \"Without Cloudflare Rate Limiting, we would be bombarded with very hefty SMS bills.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare, Koo can mitigate vulnerabilities, configure thresholds, define traffic, and customize API responses without disrupting the user experience.\n\n### __Cloudflare accelerates and improves site performance, technical automation, and user experience__\n\nTo Koo, the benefits of adopting Cloudflare aren't limited to security. Using the Cloudflare global cloud network, the company has significantly increased the performance and reliability of their in-browser experience. \n\n\"When our website loads, the Cloudflare cache ensures that our static elements, JavaScript, and CSS bundles all download from the edge network and kick in effectively,\" says Gururaj. \"Using the Cloudflare console, we can tweak the configurations to improve our caching and load times.\" \n\nAccording to Gururaj, the Cloudflare cache also streamlines Koo's upgrade and technical automation pipeline. \"With every planned release, it is painless to maintain and regenerate our caches.\"\n\nKoo also improved their experience using another out-of-the-box Cloudflare tool to personalize each user's sign-up and first log-in. With the Cloudflare IP to Geolocation API, Koo users from each region experience the platform in their local language by default. Best of all, the Koo team added the customization with minimal engineering effort.\n\n\"It's a benefit we didn't anticipate,\" Gururaj adds, \"but a welcome screen in the user's own language improves their understanding of Koo, increases retention and helps to build a sticky user journey on the platform. It's a simple use case with a significant impact.\" \n\n### __Scaling up with Cloudflare__ \n\nSince the company started using Cloudflare, Koo's traffic has increased by 1600%. Gururaj puts the platform's growth into perspective:\n\n\"Koo sees an average of 2.5 billion hits per month on our APIs and another 500 million hits on our website from Koo products. All of that traffic talks to our back-end infrastructure through an API endpoint. Cloudflare plays a critical role securing and making sure that endpoint is always up and running.\"\n\nAs a fast-growing social media platform with a significant presence in metropolitan cities as well as the tier II and tier III towns in India, Koo also witnesses bandwidth spikes and surges. Cloudflare helps to ease this load.\n\n\"When our traffic jumps 10x due to a trending hashtag or a major celebrity signing on, it doesn't cause any scaling issues,\" says Gururaj. \"We work very well in parallel with the Cloudflare team.\"\n\nAs Koo continues to scale aggressively in India, with plans afoot to attain 100 million downloads, and offer its breakthrough features in all the 22 official Indian languages, the platform seeks to collaborate and engage closely with Cloudflare.\n\n\"The kind of growth that we envision for Koo will require a lot of planning and engagement with the Cloudflare team. For Koo, the key benefit of having adopted Cloudflare has been the comprehensive protection that it provides. We have resolved every issue that was of concern, and we will continue to work as keen partners going ahead - in our journey to provide users with an immersive, superior and enriching language experience online,\" says Gururaj.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Upyun protects clients from attacks and improves customer satisfaction and retention with Cloudflare__\n\nUpyun is committed to providing customers with fully customizable CDN solutions. Based in Hangzhou, China, Upyun provides cloud storage, cloud processing, cloud security, AI video cloud, traffic marketing, and other services to help their users accelerate content distribution, product development, and business growth.\n\nIn addition to cloud services, Upyun offers live streaming, on-demand broadcasts, CDN acceleration solutions, and more. Their open and highly scalable API are used by developers to help companies obtain reliable, safe, and fast basic storage systems at affordable prices. Upyun's clients include large, recognizable brands used all over the world like Starbucks and Bytedance, and many others in the ecommerce, gaming, and elearning industries. \n\n### __Challenge: Global expansion poses security and performance problems__\n\nIn recent years, many Chinese companies have been eager to expand to overseas markets. However, as these companies begin to scale their operations, they also open themselves up to increased performance and security risks. \n\nFor Upyun, this shift posed a serious concern. Not only did they need to find a secure, fast, and scalable way of helping their customers grow - they also needed to be able to seamlessly handle increased volume from both local and international visitors during high-traffic events. With Singles' Day, the [largest online shopping day in the world according](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarandipkaur/2017/11/08/1111-everything-to-know-about-singles-day/?sh=75e706676f61) to Forbes, fast approaching, Upyun began to look for a vendor who could support them during these high pressure situations and beyond. \n\n### __Cloudflare WAF and Spectrum provide much-needed security__\n\nWhen evaluating potential vendors, Upyun listened to the advice of their customers - many of whom had previous experience with Cloudflare. Liming Zhu, Senior Vice President of Development at Upyun, said, \"Our existing clients that have deployed Cloudflare security solutions highly recommended that we consider adding Cloudflare to our portfolio. Knowing that so many of our customers were already Cloudflare users definitely made an impact on our decision.\"\n\nThe original engagement with Cloudflare began when one of their own customers, a major game developer, started to encounter malicious attacks while scaling their business overseas. \n\n\"When communicating with this client who was under attack, the need for website security was critical. We quickly teamed up with Cloudflare and developed a joint solution designed for this client's specific needs,\" Zhu adds. \n\nThis solution was a combination of Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Spectrum. Cloudflare WAF was able to mitigate ongoing attacks and provide a stalwart defense against incoming threats, while Spectrum acted as a reverse proxy to protect their TCP/UDP applications. \n\nWith the help of Cloudflare's integrated threat protection and the attack mitigated, the gaming developer was able to focus less of his time on attack prevention and more time on growing his user base. This positive feedback from the customer laid the foundation for future projects with Cloudflare as Upyun began to roll out the solutions to the rest of their customer base. \n\nWhile reflecting on the collaboration, Zhu said, \"The timing could not have been better. We met the right partner at the right time.\" \n\n### __Cloudflare's vast number of global data centers significantly improves user experience__\n\nBefore partnering with Cloudflare, Upyun's ecommerce customers struggled to support their users during peak shopping times - when traffic spikes would lead to high latency and negatively impacted sales. \n\nCloudflare's global cloud network proved to be the lifesaver Upyun and their customers needed. With hundreds of data centers all over the world, Cloudflare is able to improve site speed, uptime, and reliability for anyone connected to their network. As a result, Upyun's users saw a boost in performance - up to 30% - which helped relieve pressure in peak seasons and on critical shopping days, like Singles' Day. These improvements also led to Upyun seeing an increase in customer satisfaction and retention, contributing to their dominant position in the market. \n\n\"In a business like ours, it is critical to have a highly customizable and reliable solution,\" says Zhu. \"With the Cloudflare global network, we were able to reduce a great deal of manual attack intervention while improving our performance at the same time.\" \n\nCloudflare's suite of security and performance products have consistently helped Upyun better serve their global customer base, and they look forward to a stronger partnership. Zhu adds, \"We have received nothing but positive feedback from our clients about Cloudflare. It is the best choice in the industry, hands down.\" \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Visma Enterprise protects critical educational resources and student data with Cloudflare Magic Transit__ \n\nAs a rapidly-growing company, Visma provides business-critical software solutions to over a million customers with a focus on simplifying business processes and user experience using machine learning and automation.  With 200 companies under its umbrella, Visma has a presence in twenty countries and acquires dozens of companies each year. The overall organization has over 1 million customers in the Nordics, Benelux, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America.\n\nVisma Enterprise is one of several Visma companies and they serve 1100 customers in Finland. Among other services, it operates Wilma, a school-focused software tool the entire Finnish school system uses to record grades, absences, and student documentation, and to communicate with parents. The platform was especially critical to providing important information to parents during the COVID-19 pandemic and is visited by an average of one million active users each month. \n\n### __Challenge: DDoS attack threatened school's ability to communicate with parents and access student data__\n\nIn April 2021, Wilma was targeted by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that overwhelmed Visma Enterprise's then-existing DDoS prevention solutions, disrupting its operations and threatening its ability to fulfill service level agreements (SLAs) with its customers.\n\nTogether with its data center provider, the company explored a variety of potential solutions, but none were able to stop the attack, which was impacting the data center's other customers as well. The only remaining option was to look for another vendor that could potentially help to protect against these attacks in the future.\n\n### __Magic Transit keeps Wilma online despite frequent DDoS attacks__\n\nBased upon its own research and recommendations from trusted partners, Visma Enterprise identified Cloudflare as a potential solution to its problem. Over a weekend, Cloudflare and Visma Enterprise teamed up to move Wilma behind the protection of Cloudflare Magic Transit, which provides DDoS protection for network infrastructure After some final fine-tuning on Monday, the company turned on Magic Transit Tuesday morning.\n\nAfter activating Magic Transit, Visma Enterprise saw immediate effects. According to Kim Hisinger, Product Development Director, \"During that first hour, we saw everything just started working again really quickly. All our solutions came back online. When we looked at the statistics, it was working and stopping the DDoS attacks.\"\n\nWilma is still targeted by frequent DDoS attacks, but none of these attackers have been able to take Wilma offline. According to Hisinger, \"If an attack starts to slip through, we open a ticket, and Cloudflare helps to tweak the settings. We've never had the same attack get through more than once. I think that's a really good track record.\"\n\n### __Ensuring educational data availability and security__\n\nWilma's importance to the Finnish school system makes it highly visible to attackers and parents. While DDoS attacks typically don't result in data breaches, reports of cyberattacks against Visma raise parents' concerns.\n\nAccording to Hisinger, Magic Transit helps Visma Enterprise to meet the needs of its customers and assuage these fears. He says, \"By using Magic Transit, we show that we are a company that takes security and the protection of students' personal data really, really seriously. We demonstrate that we can protect our solutions and know what we're doing.\"\n\nIn addition to blocking frequent DDoS attacks and freeing up personnel to focus on addressing other threats and managing corporate IT assets, Visma Enterprise has also found that Magic Transit has improved Wilma's performance. By filtering out malicious traffic, Magic Transit has reduced load on Wilma's servers and enabled pages to load more quickly.\n\nAccording to Hisinger, the switch to Cloudflare has been a positive experience throughout the entire process. He says, \"I would absolutely recommend Cloudflare just based on the experience of getting it set up and that the product does its job well. The support experience is also excellent and flows very well.\"\n\nVisma looks forward to continuing their working relationship with Cloudflare, and cites Cloudflare Services and Support as one of the reasons. \"It's not every day that you get a company that really invests in your experience. I can tell that Cloudflare really wants us to succeed. Even if we're on a call in the middle of the night, the Cloudflare team is always helpful and professional,\" said Hisinger. \n",

						"longDescription": "## __SCAYLE protects online fashion retailers against ecommerce attacks with Cloudflare__\n\nFounded in 2014, ABOUT YOU is the number one online fashion platform in Europe for Generation Y and Z. Its generational appeal stems from an innovative use of celebrities and other influencers to help showcase collections and recommend outfits for consumers to try.\n\nABOUT YOU has been a technology-driven company from the very beginning. When the company was founded, ecommerce platforms on the market lacked the capabilities to bring to market applications quickly using modern development methodologies. As such, ABOUT YOU built their own ecommerce platform, which has propelled fast growth for the company.\n\nBuilding on the success of their ecommerce technology stack and go-to-market approach with the ABOUT YOU fashion ecommerce shop, ABOUT YOU's parent company, decided to make the ecommerce platform and industry expertise available to other brands and retailers, and founded SCAYLE. SCAYLE also offers consulting services to the brands running on its platform, both on the technology itself and on how to market and sell online to different markets around the world. The company now supports over 100 European online shops including Marco Polo, Tom Tailor, Depot and many others.\n\n### __Challenge: Rapid growth increases exposure to cyber threats__\n\nEcommerce retailers face a variety of cyber attacks, including credential stuffing, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, malicious bot activity, and more. As SCAYLE expanded their reach and more brands adopted the platform, their exposure to cyber attacks also increased.\n\nIn the past, SCAYLE primarily relied on a web application firewall (WAF) to protect clients from cyber threats. However, as these attacks grew larger and more complex, SCAYLE needed a more robust threat defense to safeguard their platform. To manage these risks, SCAYLE turned to Cloudflare.\n\n\"We decided to bring on Cloudflare to ultimately have the best possible security tech stack in place to protect our brands and retailers,\" explains Tobias Ring, Consulting Director Growth Service at SCAYLE and ABOUT YOU.\n\n### __Protecting online fashion retailers from prominent industry threats__\n\nBefore turning to Cloudflare, SCAYLE's clients were targeted by credential stuffing attacks two to three times per week. When successful, a credential stuffing attack allows attackers to access client accounts and fraudulently order products.\n\nAccording to Morten Gade, Circle Manager Information Security at SCAYLE: \"With Cloudflare WAF, Bot Management, and Rate Limiting, we don't see credential stuffing attacks on our platform anymore. This helps to keep shoppers' accounts safe and reduces load on our clients' sites.\"\n\nDDoS attacks posed another serious concern for SCAYLE. If a brand's site is flooded with illegitimate requests, it can disrupt service — leading to downtime, a frustrating customer experience and tarnished brand reputation. Before implementing Cloudflare mitigating DDoS attacks often took significant time and resources.\n\n\"In the past, it took a security engineer 30 minutes to an hour to investigate and block a DDoS attack,\" says Gade. \"Cloudflare automatically handles them for us, saving time and eliminating the impact of these attacks.\"\n\n### __Delivering a seamless shopping experience for clients and their customers__\n\nFor ecommerce sites — like those on SCAYLE's platform — the impact of malicious scripts and bots is not limited to direct attacks on the site. Bad bots can also abuse legitimate site features, strain underlying infrastructure, and ultimately cause e-tailers to lose customers and revenue.\n\nThe ABOUT YOU fashion platform, like other brands running on SCAYLE, commonly runs promotions and campaigns for certain products, investing significantly in advertising and getting the word out. Scalper bots target these campaign products, buying them up within a few seconds for resale. Such attacks can significantly increase the traffic load on the infrastructure and degrade the customer experience.\n\nWhen customers respond to a campaign and discover that the inventory is sold out, they often turn to resellers to purchase the item — so the original seller loses both customers and revenue as a result. With Cloudflare Bot Management, SCAYLE is able to fight back against these attacks, working to fingerprint and block scalper bots before they can compromise sales.\n\nAs SCAYLE continues as an innovation leader in the commerce technology space, Cloudflare will be there to deliver solutions to protect the company from emerging cyber threats. This allows SCAYLE to focus on their mission of empowering brands and retailers to transform their online presence and creatively serve a global clientele.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps KuoBrothers create an ecommerce platform that is secure and ensures a pleasant shopping experience__\n\nOnly four years after its founding, ecommerce retailer KuoBrothers was listed on the Taiwan OTC exchange in 2016, setting a record for the fastest listing in Taiwan's ecommerce history. KuoBrothers, which includes brands like Buy123 and PCone, sets themselves apart by using AI technology and business innovation to understand and manage the needs of the consumer market.\n\n### __Challenge: Providing the safest shopping experience for the public while reducing development work__\n\nBuy123 was established in 2013 and is KuoBrothers' largest B2C ecommerce platform. In order to provide shoppers with the most competitive prices, Buy123 painstakingly negotiates the price of each product on the shelf, and strives to create the most cost-effective shopping platform for every consumer.\n\nIn 2021, Buy123 began to focus on discounts to differentiate itself from its competitors. Through the platform's continuous price-checking mechanism and bargaining power, consumers are able to enjoy preferential discount prices in Buy123 day after day, which creates a win-win ecommerce ecosystem for merchants, consumers, and the platform alike. \n\nToday, more than six million users visit Buy123 every month, the number of monthly page views exceeds 32 million, and the transaction volume is in excess of 400 million TWD. As the platform continues to grow, Buy123 not only faces high traffic volumes, but also needs to defend against malicious requests, which have proven to be a big challenge for technicians. To combat these issues, developers at KuoBrothers decided they needed an easy to use and reliable cloud service platform.\n\n### __Cloudflare reduces the traffic load for Buy123 by effective caching and filtering requests__\n\nWith the increase in traffic volume, the first problem to be tackled by an online shopping platform is how to maintain the speed and page load times of the website.\n\n\"With Buy123's ever-growing user base, we encountered traffic load issues,\" says Chifeng Ku, Product Reliability Technology Development Manager at KuoBrothers. \"But with Cloudflare's application performance solutions, we were able to turn what would normally be a big problem into a cakewalk.\"\n\nCloudflare's cache function is one of the features most frequently used by Buy123. Cloudflare provides flexible caching options for enterprise-level customers. In the face of traffic peaks, Buy123 can create Page Rules to cache HTML, reduce the load on the web server, and improve the website loading speed.\n\n\"The caching feature has saved us a lot of traffic that would otherwise go to the web server, and the speed of the website has also improved,\" added Ku.\n\n### __Cloudflare DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting blocks fake traffic to Buy123__\n\nWhile dealing with an influx in traffic, Buy123 also often encounters malicious or fake requests.\n\n\"We are very concerned about the user experience, requests for add-ons or when people are placing orders — we don't want those functions being abused,\" says Ku.\n\nBefore using Cloudflare, processing fake requests was a costly and time-consuming affair for Buy123, requiring a lot of complex front-end work.\n\nCurrently, Buy123 uses Cloudflare's security solutions — including Web Application Firewall (WAF), DDoS protection, and Rate Limiting — across multiple domains. WAF protects against attacks that damage web assets, DDoS Protection ensures that the performance of legitimate traffic is not affected, while Rate Limiting prevents brute force login attempts and other types of abuse targeting the application layer. \n\nIn 2021, Cloudflare blocked an average of 1.8 million threats per month to Buy123, and identified and blocked an additional eight million threats during major ecommerce promotions. \n\n### __Cloudflare spares Buy123 tedious development work__\n\nCloudflare provides a simplified environment for the Buy123 and KuoBrothers' engineering teams. With assistance from the Cloudflare team, Buy123 technicians can get started quickly, saving time, expense, and effort on development work.\n\n\"After partnering with Cloudflare, we saw a significant reduction in development costs and efforts, as well as manpower — all accompanied by increased flexibility,\" Ku says. \n\nBuy123 is also starting to use Workers, Cloudflare's serverless platform, to further simplify development work — and, in turn, devote more time to product selection and consumer market research in order to [optimize their users' shopping experience](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/).\n",

Their flagship product, AfterShip, is the #1 post-purchase experience tool for enterprise and SMB retailers alike. It provides live and accurate shipment tracking notifications, which helps brands take control of the post-purchase customer experience. AfterShip also has a suite of pre-purchase and post-purchase products for ecommerce retailers, as well as consumer apps. More than 10,000 retailers use AfterShip, including leading marketplaces and iconic brands, and they serve 100,000+ customers worldwide. \n\n### __Challenge: Improve website access speed for customers while protecting data privacy__\n\nAs a key player in the ecommerce market, AfterShip wanted to ensure its platform worked quickly and reliably for customers, no matter where they are in the world. The company also wanted to ensure the security of their customer data at all times. \n\nAs the company expanded, AfterShip began to encounter malicious DDoS attacks, and their previous solution was leaving them vulnerable. \n\n### __Cloudflare DDoS protection successfully defends against large-scale attacks, assuring concrete customer data security__\n\nAfterShip needed to ensure the security of their user data without affecting the performance of their websites. After researching different solutions in the marketplace, AfterShip chose Cloudflare based on its strong reputation. \n\nAfterShip CEO Teddy Chan said, \"Fortunately, we started using Cloudflare products very early. Cloudflare's powerful DDoS protection has helped us successfully block more than 90% of attacks.\" \n\nCloudflare also met AfterShip's performance needs, enabling them to maintain a secure yet performant website, even under heavy web traffic conditions. After utilizing Cloudflare's global network, page load times immediately improved by 29%. Now, AfterShip is able to provide an improved end-user experience with the support they receive from Cloudflare, and they can retain their leadership spot at the top of the market. \n\n### __Cloudflare SSL for SaaS reduces workload and simplifies domain management__\n\nAfterShip is a  B2B2C model, serving business customers directly but also interacting with end consumers. In particular, the Branded Tracking Page function of AfterShip is created for end-users to look up their package tracking information. Before Cloudflare, AfterShip struggled with managing their customer's SSL certificates. After implementing Cloudflare SSL for SaaS, AfterShip was able to simplify the process of managing SSL certificates for custom domains, helping them provide users with more secure services. They are now able to manage these certificates much more efficiently, which allows their staff to focus on other critical projects.\n\n### __Cloudflare provides AfterShip's customers with a worry-free experience__\n\nAfterShip has been a Cloudflare customer for 7 years and sees them as a close partner, and they look forward to maintaining a long-term relationship with Cloudflare. During their time as a customer, they have onboarded and begun using other Cloudflare products like WAF and Workers. With Cloudflare, AfterShip is confident they can not only meet customer needs but also exceed customer expectations.",

Today, Moneybox offers a range of great value products and services across savings, investing, mortgages and pensions, to help people manage and achieve their short, mid, and longer-term financial goals all within one easy-to-use and engaging app.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Moneybox has seen exponential growth. It currently employs 300 people, supports a community of more than 750,000 customers, and has in excess of £2B in assets under administration. \n\nWith customer growth of 46% year on year, Moneybox is rapidly expanding in terms of mass-market adoption and on its way to becoming a category-defining wealth platform supported by award-winning technology and customer support.\n\n### __Challenge: Deliver secure access to internal infrastructure for remote workforce__\n\nSince Moneybox launched, the company has used Cloudflare Access to keep its internal applications shielded from the public internet. Access, which is now part of the Cloudflare Zero Trust platform, enables users to securely connect to corporate applications. Access easily scaled as Moneybox rapidly expanded from only 40 employees in 2016 to more than 300 today.\n\n\"Even when employees are working on site, they may be using their own devices. Cloudflare's Zero Trust Platform ensures they can connect to internal resources on any device, from anywhere, securely and with appropriate role-based controls,\" notes Jonathan Leigh, Engineering Director.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, businesses had to close their offices, and Moneybox had to quickly pivot to enable its entire workforce to work remotely, which meant providing all employees with secure, reliable remote access to all of the internal resources they needed to do their jobs. The Access solution helped the company seamlessly transition employees to work from home.\n\nThe Cloudflare Zero Trust platform delivers the high level of security required by a company operating in the financial services space, including granular role-based access controls. At the same time, employees have a much easier time securely connecting to key work-related resources. \n\n\"The Cloudflare Zero Trust platform lets us give every employee least privilege access to the applications they need to do their job,\" recalls Edward Fretwell, Engineering Director. \n\nMoneybox is using Cloudflare two-factor authentication (2FA), which provides protection against password-related cyber attacks such as credential-stuffing. The company has also integrated Cloudflare with Terraform to automate provisioning for new applications and users, saving the company time and ensuring that security controls are applied consistently.\n\n\"The Cloudflare integration with Terraform lets us protect new application types and scale with user growth in a consistent, automated way, without having to put a lot of thought into user access rules,\" Fretwell explains.\n\n\"When we were a very small company, our security needs weren't as complex,\" Fretwell says. \"Now that Moneybox is mature and growing, Cloudflare provides us with the comprehensive and nuanced protection we need against highly sophisticated cyber attacks.\"\n\n### __Freedom to innovate and bring features to market faster to serve a growing customer base__\n\nBy leveraging Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions such as Cloudflare and public cloud vendors, Moneybox is able to keep its infrastructure team lean and efficient while resting assured that Cloudflare is keeping its infrastructure and user data secure. Freed from tedious infrastructure tasks, developers can focus on innovation and quickly bring new features to market to better serve the company's massive and growing user base.\n\nIn addition to enhancing Moneybox's security posture, Cloudflare is a key partner in Moneybox's ambitious plans to continually disrupt the financial services space through non-stop innovation and a fanatical focus on its customers. \n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare solutions amplify speed and protect Dcard's global community platform against attacks__\n\nFounded in 2011, Dcard is the largest next-generation social media platform in Taiwan with 6 million registered members and 18 million unique monthly visitors. In addition to community services, Dcard is expanding into new services like [ecommerce](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) and IP and audio-visual production, and extending community services to markets like Hong Kong and Japan.\n\n### __Challenge: Guarantee platform security, increase access speed overseas, and maximize development flexibility__\n\nDcard is a popular social platform in Taiwan, with a primarily young user base. Its website provides almost 500 discussion cards with in-depth and diverse content. In addition to cards focused on topics that young people care about, Dcard users also post about interpersonal relationships, emotions and moods. Its other cards include topics such as work, workplaces, stocks, wealth management, and other self-help and growth-related content. Dcard was originally a social networking platform exclusively for college students. Recently, the site opened registration to non-college users as well as people in other regions, including Hong Kong and Japan. Since then, the number of non-college students on Dcard has reached more than 50%.\n\nDcard anonymizes users, allowing them to communicate freely on the site. When users register, they must provide an ID card or phone number. Therefore, Dcard regards security as one of its top priorities, and ensures that users' personal information will not get leaked. Additionally, Dcard's server was originally located in Taiwan, which slowed down response times in other regions, especially Japan and Hong Kong. \n\nDcard wanted to improve the security of their platform without affecting [website performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/). However, achieving this balance with an in-house solution is complex, so Dcard decided to look for a more flexible solution from external vendors. \n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare security products create a secure social platform for Dcard users__\n\nCloudflare's WAF and DDoS protection along with its Rate Limiting product portfolio enable Dcard to eliminate user security concerns. Before using Cloudflare, Dcard had to investigate the individual source of suspicious requests and then set up a custom firewall. With a 100 Tbps network, Cloudflare handles peaks of up to 35 million requests per second. Cloudflare allows Dcard to automatically filter illegal traffic, detect and block attacks, [protect applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/), and defend against data breaches. \n\nRuian Huang, Backend Architect at Dcard, is responsible for the development and operation of the Dcard system. He has peace of mind thanks to Cloudflare security products, saying, \"Cloudflare is Dcard's first line of defense against DDoS attacks. It automatically identifies and blocks these attacks and then sends an email to notify us.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers provides a flexible and lightweight development environment__\n\nBefore using Cloudflare, Dcard had to invest a lot of manpower and time to deal with security and speed issues. Manually setting rules on servers and adjusting settings on multiple devices was very complicated. For this reason, Dcard chose Cloudflare Workers, a serverless computing platform, to build a new application on the global Cloudflare network. \n\nHuang explained that \"Cloudflare Workers makes front-end work more flexible and reduces the complexity of back-end maintenance. We use Workers to handle a variety of complex tasks, including A/B testing and merging responses from multiple APIs.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare scales with Dcard's evolving performance and security needs__\n\nDcard started using Cloudflare products in 2015, starting with the free plan. With the continuous growth of their platform, Dcard switched to a business plan in 2016 and upgraded to the Enterprise plan in 2017. As their user base grew and they expanded into new markets, Dcard found that loading speeds in Japan and Hong Kong suffered. Dcard then used the global Cloudflare edge network to speed up static and dynamic content delivery, reducing bandwidth usage by 10% and reducing response delays in overseas markets by 2 to 3 times.\n\nDcard's Backend Lead, Chang Wen Lin, said, \"Cloudflare's service meets all of our needs, and it's extremely helpful. We're now able to use a single platform to complete all of our complicated development tasks.\" Dcard has also begun to try out Cloudflare Zero Trust, using the Cloudflare network to replace their traditional security perimeter. This provides teams around the world with a faster, more secure Internet. In the future, Cloudflare will continue to assist Dcard as they expand into even more new territories.",

						"longDescription": "## __Digital banking platform Q2 looks towards extensive growth with support from Cloudflare Magic Transit__\n\nQ2 began with the radical idea to simplify and integrate the banking experience across mobile, online, and voice channels. From its founding in 2005, the company has grown into a financial industry powerhouse, fueling the digital banking experiences of one out of 10 consumers in the US. Thirty-five percent of the country's top 100 banks rely on Q2's digital banking and lending services. \n\n### __Keep pace with digital banking expectations__\n\nWith $500 million in revenue in 2021, Q2 is planning for explosive growth as consumers expect the convenience of banking and borrowing from anywhere and at any time. \n\n\"Availability is the expectation that we proudly wear for our clients,\" says Jordan Hager, vice president of hosting architecture at Q2. \"With the pandemic's stimulus payments and Paycheck Protection Program loan activity, the role we play in our customers' ability to access money in a time of need really came to light.\" \n\nQ2 shifted to a distributed cloud environment to improve agility, and the company needed to ensure adequate [security](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) and availability for their Internet-facing applications.\n\n\"Operating across multiple cloud providers unlocks innovation, and our customers assume that we're doing this securely and with the same high availability that we've delivered through our private data centers,\" says Hager.\n\nQ2 not only needed to protect and scale, but also assure the highest levels of availability as the company supported more financial clients and their customers. \n\n\"Uptime is critical not just for us and our customers, but ultimately the end users who entrust in our financial platforms,\" says Joshua Pena, principal security architect at Q2. \"There are over 19 million global users of our online banking product who rely on our technology to navigate their financial lives.\"\n\n### __Solution: Secure and scale critical banking experiences__ \n\nCloudflare Magic Transit serves as the front door of Q2's network, protecting its cloud-hosted and on-premise data centers against even the largest and most sophisticated DDoS attacks. Magic Transit also accelerates Q2's application traffic, with Cloudflare's built-in Load Balancing, Next-Generation Firewall Services, and Content Caching to improve the customer experience. \n\n\"On average, roughly 35% of all inbound traffic to Q2's private cloud is malicious,\" says Pena. \"By leveraging Cloudflare, we eliminate that before it ever reaches our infrastructure.\" \nCloudflare inspects all of Q2's traffic for attacks. When malicious traffic is detected, it is automatically blocked in less than three seconds. Magic Transit provides more than 100 Tbps of network capacity and near-instant mitigation. Cloudflare's global network stops threats close to where they originate, so only clean traffic is routed to Q2's data centers and cloud providers, eliminating wasted bandwidth. \n\n\"Security has always been perceived as a natural inhibitor to innovation, but with the help of Cloudflare, we are flipping that narrative at Q2. Cloudflare is enabling our teams to deliver innovation to customers more rapidly, while elevating our security posture to new heights,\" says Pena. \"Security at the edge is no longer seen as a friction point for us; it's a differentiator.\" \n\n### __Provision network services on the fly__\n\nCloudflare Magic Transit makes it easier for Q2 to build, deploy, and scale innovative banking and lending applications. \n\n\"One of the things that separates Magic Transit from legacy solutions is infrastructure-as-code,\" says Hager. \"We have democratized access to the network so anyone who has access to our code repositories can propose changes and push code into production by following the appropriate policies,\" says Hager. \n\nWith programmable APIs for configuration, control and analytics, Magic Transit is easy to integrate into customers' infrastructure-as-code frameworks. A programmable approach allows Q2's developers to automate the deployment of network and security functions like load balancing and edge firewalls without having to wait for the network engineering team to make manual changes to the network. \n\nNot only does an infrastructure-as-code model for network and security services empower the development team, but also helps eliminate vendor lock-in. Q2 can choose the best-fit technology partners for innovation. \n\nWhen discussing this benefit, Luis Placeres, Senior IT Systems Architect at Q2 adds, \"Cloudflare is critical to our distributed-cloud strategy at Q2. Leveraging BYOIP on top of Cloudflare's advanced load balancing features, we're no longer locked into a single downstream compute environment for our products. We've embraced the flexibility of distributing workloads where they deliver the most value, whether that be in our own private data centers or with public cloud providers.\"\n\n### __Stronger communities through digital banking__\n\n\"Q2 is focused on building strong and diverse communities, and we do that by building strong financial institutions,\" says Hager. \"We look at technology as the great equalizer for financial diversity and freedom.\" \n\nWith Q2's banking and lending as a service, more regional and community banks, alternative finance, and fintech companies can offer personalized and intuitive experiences to their customers. \n\n\"Cloudflare allows us to quickly scale and deliver solutions across multiple platforms,\" says Hager. \"We look at Cloudflare as a 10x solution for us, and that's the scale we need as we strive to double our footprint in the next three years.\"\n\nCloudflare has been a strong partner in Q2's mission to transform the financial experience for millions of people. \"The Cloudflare team has been tremendous through this entire engagement,\" says Pena. \"They're quick to respond, super helpful, and have expert-level answers to our very technical questions.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare protecting and scaling Q2's banking and lending services, the company can continue to expand its market opportunity, delivering on plans to reach $1.6 billion in revenue by 2026.\n\n\"Cloudflare is transformational,\" says Pena. \"Cloudflare allows us to transform how quickly we can deliver innovation to customers.\" \n",

						"shortDescription": "An innovator in Managed Security Services dramatically reduces the risk of cyber breaches from Microsoft Office 365 and Gmail vulnerabilities, by implementing powerful anti-phishing technology.",
						"longDescription": "## __Managed security service provider strengthens its protection against cyberthreats by adding Cloudflare Area 1 to its defense infrastructure__\n\nLegato Security is a full-service Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) with a team of highly trained employees providing advanced 24/7 threat detection and comprehensive incident response services. Organizations served range from small and mid-sized firms to the Fortune 100, spanning legal, political entities and campaigns, healthcare, technology, government, and finance. \n\nLegato's managed, customizable security services include continuous security monitoring, incident response, penetration testing, malware removal, security staff augmentation, and dark web monitoring.\n\nThe company's tailored, technology-agnostic cybersecurity approach helps firms plan, build, and implement programs that address security challenges from every possible angle, and keep pace with evolving cyber threats.\n\n### __Challenge: Close cloud email security gaps that raise the risk of business email compromise, credential harvesting, and other threats__\n\nAs a provider of cybersecurity services, Legato takes the trust of its customers and their security infrastructure very seriously. As Jennifer Greulich, the company's SVP of Security Operations, notes, \"A majority of the technology solutions we sell to our clients are the same ones we use and rely on to protect our business. We wouldn't promote or endorse anything we hadn't used or weren't completely confident in.\" \n\nLike many of its customers, Legato uses Office 365 for email, relying on its native email security features to [protect it from cyber threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/). But the company quickly recognized that numerous [phishing emails](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/how-to-prevent-phishing/) were bypassing Office 365's security. This \"phishing gap\" resulted in incidents that required investigation and remediation. The company realized it needed specific anti-phishing technology that goes above and beyond Office 365's native capabilities.\n\n### __Legato selects Cloudflare for its proactive approach to phishing threat detection__\n\nLegato made the decision to integrate the Cloudflare [email security solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/email-security-services/) in-house first. \"Deployment was complete in a couple of hours,\" said Greulich.\n\nThe Cloudflare technology made an immediate difference, drastically reducing phishing incidents \"from 10-15 per week to one or two.\" Over time, the results became even more striking. \"Cloudflare has performed outstandingly for us,\" said Greulich. \"We have seen a significant and prolonged drop in phishing emails. Not only that, the Cloudflare service has had little to no impact on email productivity, which means there are minimal false positives.\"\n\nLegato is pleased that employees who previously had to interrupt their work to report, investigate and deal with phishing incidents are now freed up to remain focused on their jobs. And of course, Cloudflare reduced the concern, endured by all organizations, that even a \"security awareness trained\" employee can be manipulated into clicking on a phish or complying with a [business email compromise](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) (BEC) scheme.\n\n### __Legato customers using cloud email suites see fewer phishing attacks after implementing Cloudflare Email Security__\n\nLegato's own clients often rely on Office 365, or G Suite defenses, along with their respective native email security tools to protect their organizations from cyber threats. But typically, these clients did not have specific anti-phishing resources or tools before working with Legato.\n\n\"Since it's our business to select and manage technology for our customers, it's important for us to understand those unique customers' environments and challenges,\" said Greulich. \"In many cases customers come with a specific issue to be addressed. So in working with what the customer has, we then see additional needs calling for the addition of an anti-phishing layer to deal with or prevent breaches. When our customers ask us for suggestions on phishing protection, we always recommend Cloudflare,\" said Greulich.\n\nIn fact, for their Managed Services customers, Legato actually builds in Cloudflare's anti-phishing service when it develops quotes for securing the customer's email. In those situations, Legato manages administrative control of the Office 365 or G Suite environment, [configuring](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-security/deployment/) it for maximum security and adding Cloudflare Cloud Email Security service as the phishing protection layer.\n\n\"Cloudflare Cloud Email Security deployment goes really well: We rely on a simple guide for the steps to follow when installing Office 365 and G Suite protection.\"\n\nLegato checks in regularly with their customers and shares Cloudflare reports that document the messages that were blocked. In some cases, customers with the skills and technological resources can access the Cloudflare portal directly.\n\n\"Cloudflare's message-tracing features have been extremely helpful when it comes to tracking email that should have been delivered but wasn't — or that was delivered but shouldn't have been. It's really helpful to be able to see that message trace; you can observe for yourself and see the actual email flow and detection details on the Cloudflare portal.\"\n\nLegato's customers who had been using Office 365 native defenses and still suffer from phishing attacks also saw those attacks drop precipitously after adding Cloudflare's anti-phishing service. Their Gmail-using customers who adopt Cloudflare Cloud Email Security have also seen nearly 100 percent of their attacks shut down preemptively — before they could even enter the inbox.\n\n### __Legato reaffirms clients' trust with forward-thinking, multi-layered defenses__\n\n\"Every day, we do our best to reaffirm our clients' trust with forward-thinking, multi- layered defenses,\" said Greulich. \"Because we aren't tied to any one technology or provider, we can advise without bias. Our only obligation is to defend our clients in the most strategic way possible. This technology-agnostic approach sets us apart from most MSS vendors.\"\n\nLegato checks in regularly with their customers and shares Cloudflare  reports that document the messages that were blocked. In some cases, customers with the skills and technological resources can access the Cloudflare portal directly. \n\n\"Cloudflare's message-tracing features have been extremely helpful when it comes to tracking email that should have been delivered but wasn't — or that was delivered but shouldn't have been. It's really helpful to be able to see that message trace; you can observe for yourself and see the actual email flow and detection details on the Cloudflare portal.\"\n\n\"Since working with Cloudflare,\" says Greulich, \"Legato has seen a significant drop in phishing email incidents, with little to no impact on email productivity and minimal false positives. This service is just extremely effective at stopping phishing. We don't use or recommend products we don't believe in — so our recommendation of Cloudflare for our own customers underscores our belief in this service, based on its performance in our company.\"\n",

PChome Online Inc. was officially incorporated in July 1998, and went public in January 2005, becoming the first internet company to be listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (symbol 8044). PChome is now the leading integrated e-commerce service group in Taiwan, providing [e-commerce](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/), FinTech, warehousing, logistics, and fulfillment service.\n\n### __Challenge: Self-built CDN solution cannot support the surge in traffic volume during promotional periods__\n\nPreviously, PChome relied on a homegrown content delivery network (CDN). Unfortunately, this solution had limited capacity and could not support heavy traffic volumes. This was particularly noticeable with push advertisements during promotions when images would load slowly. For some time, PChome assumed it was normal for images to load slowly when there were too many visitors on the site. They wanted to [improve the customer experience](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/), so they began to look for an external vendor. \n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare's global network solves image buffering delays and simplifies the complexity of independent operations__\n\nIn the end, PChome decided to adopt the Cloudflare global network. After making the switch, PChome found that their push advertisements no longer suffered from buffering. In fact, the entire website now loads smoothly no matter how much traffic spikes during promotional periods, greatly improving the user experience.  This time is very valuable when it comes to customer retention. \n\nIn addition to being highly satisfied with the results, PChome also appreciates how intuitive and easy it is to use. Chen Tsan-Yuan, PChome Online Inc. Assistant Vice President , says, \"Not only do Cloudflare solutions provide noticeable speed improvements, they also have a very user-friendly interface.\"\n\nPChome also appreciates the support they receive from the Cloudflare team. When PChome encounters issues, the Cloudflare team responds extremely quickly and solves problems rapidly. Chen Tsan-Yuan added, \"From evaluating the product and throughout the entire usage process, communication between us and the Cloudflare team was very smooth.

It provides 1-on-1 online language lessons with verified native teachers in more than 150 languages, also integrates free language learning content and tools, and a global community for all language lovers. It currently connects more than 30,000 teachers and tens of millions of students from over 190 countries. italki believes that human connection and cultural immersion are the best ways to learn languages and reach fluency. It is imperative to their business that they stay online and secure, so they can continue to serve language learners all over the world.\n\n### __Challenge: Improve online platform's stability and security__\n\nitalki cares deeply about the security, stability, and efficiency of its platform, since those qualities make its language learning community more robust. \n\nUnfortunately, the company has faced serious attacks in the past. In one instance, an HTTP flood DDoS attack on the italki web server brought the service down for more than 5 hours, resulting in a decrease in users, a degraded user experience, and a loss of nearly one million dollars. italki knew it needed to prevent such an attack from happening again.\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare security tools protect italki from indiscriminate cyber attacks__\n\nitalki began working with Cloudflare in 2021, using security services including the web application firewall (WAF), DDoS protection, and Rate Limiting to build the first line of defense for the platform. Spark Liu, italki's technical director, said, \"We chose Cloudflare to block indiscriminate attacks, provide italki with security protection at the outermost layer, and integrate with italki's own security protection technology to ensure the stable operation of italki from different dimensions.\"\n\nCloudflare's 100 Tbps network blocks an average of 76 billion threats per day, prevents DDoS attacks from the edge, and responds quickly, providing italki with unmetered, always-on DDoS protection. Currently, Cloudflare blocks approximately 5 million malicious attacks for italki every month.\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare Bot Management protects italki user content__\n\nitalki's user content is also an important area for protection. The italki community provides users with services such as podcasts, exercises, and Q&As. Users can freely post on the platform, exchange language experiences with other learners, or ask teachers questions. To prevent this content from being maliciously crawled and used for unintended purposes, otherwise known as content scraping, italki uses Cloudflare's Bot Management solution — which seamlessly integrates with other products in use, such as WAF, DDoS, and CDN — to identify automated programs.\n\nWith Bot Management, italki can use threat intelligence drawn from the millions of Internet properties on the Cloudflare network to quickly and accurately stop content scrapers and other bots without complicated configurations or maintenance, allowing the company to spend more time on platform construction and creating greater value for users.\n\nIn addition to security tools, italki also uses Workers, Cloudflare's serverless development platform, to complete migration from the old technology stack to the Cloudflare platform, avoiding complicated technical work. In the future, italki will continue to explore Cloudflare products to create a safer, more stable, and more efficient language learning platform for users worldwide.",

Shoptop supports merchants as they scale globally, and they are focused on providing a continuously great user experience.\n\n### __Challenge: Inconsistent user experience for Shoptop merchants and consumers in different regions__\n\nSecurity and speed are top priorities for Shoptop's customers — or 'merchants' — since they are operating in markets all over the world. However, before working with Cloudflare, Shoptop's security and performance solutions only worked well in certain regions. For example, Shoptop's CDN guaranteed fast page load times for merchants in mainland China, but load times for merchants from overseas, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were slow. This problem compounded when Shoptop merchants used VPNs to access their websites, leading to a poor customer experience.\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare improves Shoptop's site speeds while also providing comprehensive protection__\n\nShoptop's goal is to provide a secure environment for merchants and consumers. Shoptop uses Cloudflare security and performance tools like DDoS protection and the content delivery network (CDN) across multiple domains. Cloudflare DDoS protection successfully mitigates about 10,000 attacks for Shoptop every month, while also ensuring that the performance of legitimate traffic is not affected. Shoptop CTO Sam Huang said, \"As the Shoptop brand grows rapidly across the world, Cloudflare intercepts thousands of malicious attacks every month, ensuring that our global merchants and consumers can continue to enjoy secure and reliable services.\"\n\nWhile ensuring security, Shoptop also values speed, because page load times can significantly impact user experience and is a major determinant of user retention. To [increase the speed and further optimize the experience](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) of users overseas and in Hong Kong and Taiwan, Shoptop chose Cloudflare's CDN and Spectrum products. Cloudflare Spectrum accelerated traffic in real-time and resolve network congestion, while the CDN cached static content closer to users and provide dynamic content through the fastest and most reliable private backbone links. \n\nAfter just a few months of use, Cloudflare has accelerated Shoptop's overall site speeds by 50 percent. More specifically, loading speeds in North America, Europe, and Hong Kong have increased the most, by up to 60 percent. This has paired well with Shoptop's recent growth. Over the past six months, Shoptop's overseas users have increased by 600 percent, and the total volume of business has increased by nearly 10 times. \n\n### __Solution: When traffic surges, Cloudflare provides the most cost-effective bandwidth services__\n\nBefore working with Cloudflare, Shoptop bought bandwidth from local and domestic suppliers with mixed results. Huang said, \"Different suppliers charge different prices. The solutions of many suppliers seemed to be relatively cheap at the beginning, but when encountering a large volume of traffic, costs started to become very high. In the long run, Cloudflare's price/performance ratio was the real winner.\" \n\nThe Cloudflare CDN can cache content on the Cloudflare network, reducing the need to obtain content from original sites, thereby reducing bandwidth costs. After using Cloudflare, Shoptop has saved 50% on bandwidth traffic, and total product costs have been reduced by 10% compared with previous solutions.\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare support delivers excellent service, allowing Shoptop to provide continuous protection for their merchants__\n\nIn addition to being satisfied with Cloudflare products, Shoptop also appreciates the support they get from the Cloudflare team, specifically citing their quick responses and quality of service. In the early days of Shoptop using Spectrum, not only would Cloudflare engineers assist Shoptop in completing configurations, but Cloudflare's support team would also follow up and ask for feedback.\n\n\"Working with Cloudflare has been a great experience. They are very professional, and services are spot on,\" Huang noted. In addition to security and performance tools, Shoptop plans to continue to work with Cloudflare to provide a solid security guarantee for Shoptop merchants as they export their brands overseas.\n",

SolCyber is a modern MSSP, insomuch that we take what we've learned over the years from working with Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 companies, and we take that technology and package it into very easy-to-consume modules for the mid-market and small enterprises.\n\n### __Why did you choose to build Cloudflare into your managed security offering?__\n\nScott McCrady: We chose to use Cloudflare for our email security solution for the simple fact that email often is the entry point for bad people to get footholds into the organization. Account takeovers and business email compromise are critical problems that especially mid-market customers face. The way Cloudflare goes about their solution with their web crawlers and their understanding of the attack surface when it comes to email, they are truly second to none when it comes to understanding advanced attacks and protecting our customers.\n\n### __How does the Cloudflare Solution improve the management and operation of your SOC?__\n\nScott McCrady: Cloudflare helps our SOC in the fact that it's very, very high fidelity. What really matters for our customers is accuracy and catching the bad guys. And so if your email solution isn't high fidelity and also able to address and see advanced attacks, then you're left blind. And so from our standpoint, we have to know what the bad guys are doing. Cloudflare is exceptional at finding them and then putting that information in front of our analysts so that we can review it, double check it, correlate it with any other incidents or information we see from other devices and technologies, and let our customers know how to remediate or resolve any problems.\n\n### __How do you use Cloudflare to provide additional value to customers?__\n\nScott McCrady: Cloudflare provides exceptional value to our customers in two different ways. The first is accuracy on quarantining of emails. It's important that the bad stuff gets quarantined, and the good stuff gets through. They're very accurate on quarantines. From a SOC standpoint, from a customer standpoint, we're not consistently having to go in and quarantine items. The secondary value is around business email compromise and account takeovers. This is a real big challenge for most email solutions to get ahead of that problem and be able to detect it. Cloudflare, again, is exceptional at finding those types of activities and helping our customers know when that's happening, and helping us know when it's happening so that we can let the customers know.\n\n### __What would you tell a customer about Cloudflare? What about a prospective partner?__\n\nScott McCrady: What I think is important for customers to understand is that in the sea of 3,500 vendors out there, Cloudflare just works. It works great. It's somebody that they can have faith in, you can trust in them that their product's going to do what they say it does. It's easy to install, has great details in the dashboards, and is a great solution. From a prospective partner standpoint, it really matters that one, the technology works, but two, that the vendors themselves understand channels and partnering and Cloudflare understands this in great, great detail. So it doesn't matter whether or not you're a VAR or an MSSP,  they understand your business model, and they designed Cloudflare in the commercial models to really support you.\n",

I'm the senior manager of IT in Security at Namely. Namely creates an all-in-one HR payroll and benefits platform for small-to-medium businesses. Our mission is to help companies create better work spaces through a modern HR stack.\n\n### __What email security challenges were you facing?__\nRob Hooper: Before Cloudflare, Namely was drawing the stock filtering in Gmail to secure inboxes. Google does a good job handling spam, but phishing emails for our support teams was a big problem. It's critical for us to deliver every single valid email from our clients to our support teams. However, we also have to make sure to filter out all the malicious content that could put our clients at risk. You know, that's an especially tricky challenge for a managed payroll provider, because the content of the email that we receive would look suspicious in any other circumstances. For example, it would be common for us to receive emails from a non-Namely address saying, \"Help, I can't run payroll\". Obviously, it was a difficult challenge and we knew that. And we also knew that most traditional anti phishing tools weren't equipped for the task. \n\n### __Why did you choose Cloudflare?__\nRob Hooper: Our CTO at the time recommended we check out Cloudflare because he had heard good things from leaders at other companies. After a quick POC, we were impressed with Cloudflare's ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio, its flexible remediation options, and integrations that it offered.\n\n### __How did Cloudflare improve your security program?__\nRob Hooper: We were able to deploy Cloudflare as a transparent layer of protection on top of our existing email service, with zero downtime. This allows us to better secure inboxes without having the employees needing to know anything about Cloudflare or change their email habits in any way. As a result, our user-reported phishing investigations were cut by at least half. Since implementation, we've never had to release a falsely convicted email from our admin quarantine. The solution just works. This frees up our time for other proactive activities. Phishing is never going to be a solved problem for us, but since Cloudflare, it's a problem that no longer keeps me up at night. \n\n### __What would you tell a colleague/peer about Cloudflare?__\nRob Hooper: Namely has had a good experience with Cloudflare. The solution is a very good value in terms of the amount of risk it mitigates to the dollars it costs. On top of that, it does its thing while requiring very little of our time and energy to maintain.\n",

As Europe's leading online fashion platform, with [annual revenues of €8 billion](https://www.statista.com/topics/7153/zalando/#dossierKeyfigures), Berlin-based Zalando is disrupting the highly competitive online fashion industry. Zalando's more than 46 [million active customers](https://www.statista.com/topics/7153/zalando/#dossierKeyfigures) can browse an extensive collection of clothing, shoes, beauty products, and accessories from over 4500 international brands, sold across 23 countries. While the bulk of its sales are [online](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/), the company also operates 12 (and counting) brick-and-mortar outlet retail stores in Germany.\n\n### __Challenge: Protect an internal network that is critical to customer fulfillment operations__\n\nZalando's enterprise network connects their fulfillment centers, the fashion store, outlet retail locations, and company headquarters. If their network were to go offline, a cascade of problems could ensue. Warehouse workers would be left idle until the problem is fixed, causing fulfillment backlogs and electronic communications between fulfillment centers, outlet retail stores, and the company headquarters would come to a halt, further impeding customer service.\n\nIn early November 2020, DDoS attacks were gaining momentum and quickly increasing in frequency and intensity, and the fact that the holiday shopping season was rapidly approaching, convinced Zalando that they needed a proactive and robust [network security solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/) for their enterprise network to prevent possible outages.\n\n### __Cloudflare helps Zalando maintain a world-class customer experience through the holiday season and beyond__\n\nZalando chose Cloudflare Magic Transit, a cloud-based solution that uses Cloudflare's global network to protect entire IP subnets from DDoS attacks while also accelerating network traffic.\n\nCloudflare adds an additional layer of security to Zalando's network while [improving performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) and availability, ensuring that customer orders are fulfilled quickly and accurately. It also enhances productivity and reduces operational costs by freeing up engineers to work on continuously enhancing the customer experience instead of mitigating DDoS attacks.\n\n\"Cloudflare Magic Transit is a 'set it and forget it' DDoS solution, which is exactly what we needed. We're a busy team, and we don't have time for a tool that requires constant oversight,\" explains Santiago Serra, Network Architect.\n\nCloudflare blocks an average of 200 potential attacks each week. In fact, Cloudflare's automated protection thwarts attacks before Zalando is even aware of them!\n\n### __Security analytics and performance tools bundled with Magic Transit are a value-add__\n\nCloudflare has simplified how Zalando routes traffic through their network by enabling the company to offload traffic completely to Cloudflare. Additionally, Cloudflare provides valuable analytics — such as availability on different hops and inbound traffic patterns — that Zalando has integrated with its other security tools.\n\n\"What's great is that all of Cloudflare's services work hand-in-glove with each other and can be managed from the same dashboard,\" says Zalando engineering manager Guillermo Cotone.\n\nCloudflare ensures that Zalando is not only protected from attacks, but can provide a best-in-class experience for their loyal customer base — all without placing extra burden on their internal teams.\n\n\"We're focused on automation, standardization, and resiliency so that we can grow in an orderly and secure fashion. Cloudflare helps us ensure the resiliency of our internal network,\" Serra adds.\n\nWith Cloudflare protection in place, Zalando can tackle their ambitious growth plans with confidence. The company can scale as rapidly and as much as they wish while maintaining the world-class customer service the Zalando brand is known for.\n",

Fitness studios, salons, spas, and integrative health centers rely on Mindbody's integrated software and payments platform to manage, promote and expand their businesses. Consumers turn to the Mindbody app to find and interact with health and wellness businesses around the world - from signing up for gym classes, to booking spa appointments, to finding a hair stylist in their local area, and more. Consumers expect a seamless and pleasant experience when searching for and booking classes and services at wellness studies.  However, this user experience can be placed at risk by cyberattacks that cause account lockouts and potentially leverage compromised credentials to access user accounts and make fraudulent reservations or purchases.\n\nPreviously, Mindbody had deployed many different solutions across their on-premises and cloud-based infrastructure, including multiple CDNs, WAFs, and a bot mitigation service.  However, these solutions were complex to manage and did not meet Mindbody's needs.  According to Eric Pierce, Senior Manager Cybersecurity at Mindbody, \"We had a diversity of products all of which had different interfaces and different capabilities used in different platforms across different things. It was really hard to manage and monitor that many disparate solutions and different environments.\"\n\n### __Challenge: Blocking cyber threats with an easy-to-use, powerful security architecture__\nConsumers expect a seamless and pleasant experience when searching for and booking classes and services at wellness studies.  However, this user experience can be placed at risk by cyberattacks that cause account lockouts and potentially leverage compromised credentials to access user accounts and make fraudulent reservations or purchases.\n\nPreviously, Mindbody had deployed many different solutions across their on-premises and cloud-based infrastructure, including multiple CDNs, WAFs, and a bot mitigation service.  However, these solutions were complex to manage and did not meet Mindbody's needs.  According to Eric Pierce, Senior Manager Cybersecurity at Mindbody, \"We had a diversity of products all of which had different interfaces and different capabilities used in different platforms across different things. It was really hard to manage and monitor that many disparate solutions and different environments.\"\n\n### Security integration streamlines monitoring and management\nAfter a thorough evaluation, Mindbody decided to partner with Cloudflare to replace seven legacy tools with a solution that seamlessly protected both its on-prem and cloud-based assets.  This shift eliminated the complexity of managing multiple point solutions and provided improved visibility and protection for Mindbody's IT infrastructure.  Adelyn Fears, Security Engineer at Mindbody, says, \"With Cloudflare, we've been able to replicate all the functionality that we had previously with a variety of tools and consolidate it into one, which just makes everything easier.\"\n\n### __Blocking the leading cyber threats to online commerce__\nLike all online enterprises, Mindbody and its customers are targeted by credential stuffing, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), data scraping, and other attacks. These cyber threats harm the customer experience, place sensitive data at risk, and waste Mindbody's resources.\nCloudflare Bot Management, WAF, and DDoS protection have dramatically reduced Mindbody's exposure to these automated attacks. According to Pierce, \"Right now, about 20% of the requests inbound to Mindbody services are bots. Some of those are good bots like Googlebots, but some are web scrapers and credential stuffers. With Cloudflare, we're able to tell the difference between the good bots and the bad bots and create rules that only allow the good bots through.\"\n\n### __Eliminating false positives to improve customer experience__\nMindbody's customers expect to be able to quickly and easily access their studio's business account and consumers expect to seamlessly book a fitness class or schedule an appointment.  However, several times each day, a legacy solution blocked legitimate users and directed them to contact Mindbody's security team.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management offered improved bot detection and the ability to more precisely tune detection rules to reduce false-positive detections.  Instead of multiple customers and consumers being redirected each day, Mindbody's security team now only addresses a few account lockout issues per week.  Pierce says, \"With Cloudflare, our security blocks have dropped by about 95%, which is a huge improvement.  We've mitigated bot scraping and improved the customer experience.\"\n\n### __Controlling access for remote contractors__\nMindbody works with a group of remote contractors who need access to certain internal resources to do their work.  However, directly exposing its servers to remote workers places Mindbody at greater cyber risk. Cloudflare Access enables Mindbody to manage its third-party risk by implementing zero trust remote access for its contractors.  Remote access to Mindbody's systems is strictly limited based on business needs, limiting the potential impact of a compromised user account.\nProtecting against modern and future cyber threats\n\nMindbody is an innovation leader in the wellness space.  As Mindbody's platform continues to evolve to meet the changing needs of its customers and consumers, Cloudflare provides [protection against modern and emerging cyber threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/).\n",

						"shortDescription": "SIXT partners with Cloudflare to halt daily bot attacks that degrade website and app performance",
						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps SIXT stop bot attacks and build proactive security defenses__ \n\nHeadquartered in Pullach, near Munich, Germany, SIXT SE is a leading international provider of high-quality mobility services. With its products [SIXT rent](https://www.sixt.com/#/), [SIXT share](https://www.sixt.com/share/#/), [SIXT ride](https://www.sixt.com/ride) and [SIXT+](https://www.sixt.com/plus/#/) the company offers a uniquely integrated premium mobility service across the fields of vehicle and commercial vehicle rental, car sharing, ride hailing and car subscriptions that can all be booked via the SIXT App. SIXT is present in approximately 110 countries worldwide. The listed family-owned company's strengths lie in its consistent customer focus, a living culture of innovation with strong technological expertise, its fleet of premium cars and its exceptional value for money. Since 2009, Sixt SE has more than doubled its revenue in the Mobility business segment and generated revenue of EUR 2.49 billion in this segment in its previous record year 2019 (total group EUR 3.31 billion). It is ranked as one of the most profitable mobility companies in the world. In the third quarter 2021, Sixt SE posted the best quarterly operating result in the company's history and is heading for a full-year result that exceeds the record year 2019. Sixt SE, the Group's parent company, has been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 1986 (WKN common shares: 723132, WKN preferred shares: 723133).\n\n### __Challenge: Mitigate daily bot attacks that were degrading performance and preventing overnight system upgrades and testing__\n\nSIXT was facing a major problem with price-scraping bots, which attacked SIXT's systems on a daily basis. The bots significantly degraded performance on both the company's website and mobile app, and the regular early-morning attacks prevented SIXT from scheduling overnight system upgrades and testing. This could prevent customers from being able to access the SIXT website and its services. \n\nSIXT's engineers attempted to mitigate the bots with a previous solution, but the product was not robust enough to fit SIXT's needs. The solution did not allow them to act quickly enough, so by the time SIXT managed to block the bots, the threat actors behind the attacks would alter the bots to evade SIXT's defenses. Additionally, the past solution could not differentiate between malicious bots and legitimate automated traffic from SIXT's extensive partner network.\n\nSIXT turned to Cloudflare for a more comprehensive solution. In addition to Cloudflare Bot Management, SIXT implemented a performance and security suite that includes the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), CDN, and Rate Limiting. To complement these products, SIXT added Cloudflare Workers, which provides developers with a serverless execution environment that enables them to create entirely new applications or augment existing apps with custom code at the edge, without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management puts a halt to daily bot attacks and enables SIXT to take a proactive security stance__\n\nAfter deploying Cloudflare Bot Management, SIXT stopped experiencing daily early-morning bot attacks. After first mirroring the setup they had had with their previous provider, SIXT configured Bot Management to perform additional logging, which enabled their engineers to block problematic endpoints, proactively hardening their defenses against malicious traffic.\n\n\"Cloudflare Bot Management lets us block bad bots as soon as we see them,\" explains Anthony Davis, senior engineering manager, IT software operations. \"Since implementing Cloudflare, we have not had any downtime due to bots.\"\n\nIn addition to making SIXT's website far more reliable, which enhances the customer experience, Cloudflare Bot Management saves SIXT money on infrastructure and personnel.\n\n\"My engineers no longer have to get up at 4:00 a.m., and we no longer have to run specific clusters just to handle bot traffic,\" Davis notes. \"We are also able to perform upgrades and testing in the overnight hours without worrying about our infrastructure being overtaxed.\"\n\nBot Management's analytics have also made it easier for SIXT to have difficult conversations with some of their partners. These partners are permitted to use bots to obtain data from SIXT. However, some of them had been using unapproved methods to access the data, resulting in them inadvertently bombarding SIXT's systems with automated requests — and being blocked.\n\n\"These partners did not mean to cause problems; they just did not realize how many requests they were sending in short periods of time,\" Davis explains. \"Now, when they complain about being blocked, we can show them Bot Management data demonstrating that they were sending far more requests than they thought.\"\n\nIn addition to preventing SIXT's daily bot attacks, Bot Management protects the company's systems around the clock. On one occasion, Bot Management stopped a very large bot attack in its tracks.\n\n\"We were experiencing a bot attack that could have taken us offline for some time,\" Davis recalls. \"It would have taken a considerable amount of time for us to rewrite code and block it manually. Bot Management stopped the attack immediately.\" \n\n### __Cloudflare Workers and WAF complement Bot Management to provide SIXT with a total security solution__\n\nThe Cloudflare Workers serverless platform saves SIXT's engineers a great deal of development time by enabling them to easily augment existing code, as opposed to having to do a rewrite. Among other use cases, SIXT leverages Workers as a complement to Bot Management.\n\n\"The combination of the Cloudflare Workers serverless platform and Bot Management makes it easy to differentiate bad bots from legitimate automated traffic,\" says Davis. \"We use Workers scripts to allow traffic through if the Bot Management bot score falls below a certain number.\"\n\nSIXT is also using Workers to set up a new development environment that integrates with its version control system. This will enable engineers to safely \"break\" code in production, enhancing innovation and letting SIXT get new products and features to market faster.\n\nThe Cloudflare WAF works in conjunction with Bot Management and Workers to enhance SIXT's security while saving the company time and money by allowing them to properly use their resources. SIXT uses the WAF to set up IP blocking and allow lists on endpoints that are restricted only to certain customers.\n\n\"We can immediately accomplish things with the WAF that would take weeks if we had to refactor our app code,\" Davis says. \"Cloudflare WAF frees up my team to work on new products and features instead of security configurations.\"\n\nDavis can see SIXT is getting great value from Cloudflare, and he plans to use Cloudflare solutions to protect more domains and services. \"I am a big believer in voting with my feet,\" Davis says. \"If I do not like a service, I will go elsewhere, and if I am happy, I will grow the relationship. I am thrilled with Cloudflare, and I intend to put as many assets behind it as possible.\" \n\nKlaus Kolitz, Chief Technology Officer at Sixt adds, \"With Cloudflare we have confidence that we have the tools we need to ensure a safe and fast online experience for our customers, while providing our teams a flexible and secure way to build and deploy applications.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __BlockFi simplifies its security stack while enabling scalable Zero Trust remote access to internal resources__\n\nWith a mission to bring financial empowerment to traditionally underserved markets, BlockFi bridges the worlds of traditional finance and blockchain technology on a global scale. BlockFi's interest accounts, cryptocurrency-backed loans, BlockFi Rewards Credit Card and crypto trading platform are leveraged by crypto-asset owners worldwide, ranging from everyday retail clients to top-tier hedge funds. \n\nBlockFi supports over 450,000 funded clients and manages over $10 billion in assets (as of June 30, 2021). The company is backed by more than $450 million in equity funding, including a recent Series D funding round led by Bain Capital that [raised $350 million](https://www.blockfi.com/blockfi-completes-usd350-million-series-d). \n\n### __Challenge: Replace a complex security solution with a comprehensive Zero Trust platform — but first, stop a massive DDoS and API attack__\n\nIn 2020, BlockFi had been deploying multiple services from a vendor to protect external web properties and protect employees from online threats. The solutions were complex to deploy, required multiple endpoint agents, and lacked natively integrated capabilities to secure application access. Additionally, BlockFi relied on IP-based controls to enable remote access to key corporate resources. Maintaining these IP blocks and allow lists across a rapidly growing, globally distributed workforce of nearly 1,000 employees was time-consuming and not scalable.\n\nJust as BlockFi began exploring alternative vendors and approaches, they were suddenly and simultaneously struck by two serious cyberattacks: a very large DDoS attack and an attack on its sign-up API. The attacks occurred during a major growth spurt, during which BlockFi was signing up approximately 20,000 new retail clients each week.\n\nLacking sufficient internal resources to mitigate the attacks on their own, BlockFi contacted Cloudflare for help. \"Cloudflare came to BlockFi in our hour of need,\" recalls Adam Healy, Chief Security Officer. \"I literally woke up my Cloudflare contact at 6:00 a.m. They quickly mobilized every resource we needed, even though BlockFi wasn't a Cloudflare customer at the time.\"\n\n### __After stopping DDoS & API attacks, Cloudflare works with BlockFi to implement scalable Zero Trust security solutions__\n\nCloudflare helped BlockFi halt the DDoS and API attacks during an onboarding session allowing systems operations to return to normal within 6 hours, saving \"thousands, if not millions\" of dollars in lost revenue and helping mitigate reputational damage among customers and investors.\n\nAfter mitigating the attacks, BlockFi decided to pursue a more comprehensive organizational security transformation to protect its workforce and sensitive data with the Cloudflare Zero Trust platform. This platform includes a Zero Trust network access (ZTNA) solution to [protect applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) across cloud and on-premise environments, along with a secure web gateway (SWG) solution to provide [threat protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) from ransomware, phishing, and other Internet-based threats.\n\nAll of BlockFi's high-value internal applications are now secured behind the Cloudflare ZTNA solution, including two applications that handle sensitive data and represent an estimated 70% of BlockFi's mission-critical operations. \n\n\"Cloudflare gave us fine-grained, Zero Trust access control over our internal applications throughout our distributed environment, which is an enormous improvement in our security posture,\" says Dan Rue, Lead Site Reliability Engineer. \"We have full control over system ingress, we can scale much better, and we're much more resilient.\"\n\nHealy adds, \"Cloudflare's Zero Trust services enabled us to protect our remote-first, globally distributed workforce and critical internal applications that are not exposed to the public Internet.\"\n\n### __A simpler security stack helps BlockFi minimize costs and increase productivity, while serverless computing and static site hosting using Cloudflare Workers optimize development processes__\n\nWith Zero Trust network access in place, BlockFi was able to stop using IP block and allow lists, which previously demanded the dedicated attention of four full-time engineers. Additionally, employees whose IP addresses changed were frequently forced to remain idle while BlockFi engineers added their new IPs to allow lists. Now, employees securely access resources from anywhere, on any device, simply by logging on through BlockFi's single sign-on (SSO) provider, Okta.\n\n\"Since our engineers no longer have to maintain IP block and allow lists, they have far more time to focus on strategic projects that drive the business, such as enhancing applications,\" says Eric Freeman, VP, Security Program Management. \n\nSeeing an opportunity to improve development processes, BlockFi also added Cloudflare Workers, which provides developers with a serverless execution environment, and Cloudflare Pages, a JAMstack platform for frontend developers to rapidly deploy fast-loading websites.\n\nBlockFi is using Cloudflare Workers to move more application logic to its network edge, which enhances performance and simplifies the company's internal architecture. BlockFi's developers frequently use Workers to insert code snippets into static sites built with Cloudflare Pages, which allows them to make changes far more quickly than if they had to rewrite the site code. Moving forward, BlockFi anticipates using Workers far more often.\n\n\"Workers solves our most complicated use cases in an elegant and simple fashion, while Cloudflare Pages provides us with best-in-class static site hosting that's much easier to use than our cloud services provider,\" notes Rue.\n\n### __BlockFi enjoys defense in depth at the network edge__\n\nBy enabling BlockFi to block user traffic to malicious websites out of the box, Cloudflare reduces the risk of employees being victimized by drive-by malware or phishing sites as they browse the Internet. For phishing emails specifically -- whether to everyone in the organization or only to a specific target -- BlockFi can run antivirus inspection and use threat category filters to prevent risky links from resolving.\n\nBlockFi also saw instant results from the Cloudflare Bot Management solution, which it deployed simultaneously with Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform. Within the first day of deployment, Bot Management blocked approximately 10 million malicious bots from reaching BlockFi's site. In addition to ensuring that malicious traffic does not degrade site performance, this protects BlockFi from credential-stuffing and other bots that seek to compromise user login credentials.\n\n\"By protecting our employees from phishing links, credential-stuffing, and other attacks on their login credentials, Cloudflare gives us the end user protection that's crucial to defense in depth,\" explains Freeman.\n\nFrom ZTNA to DDoS protection to security against malicious bots, Cloudflare solutions are so deeply woven into BlockFi's data environment that they effectively make up the company's network edge.\n\n\"Cloudflare is our edge. It protects our entire cloud environment,\" Healy says. \"Our perimeter is secure, and we have the resiliency to scale as much and as quickly as we want.\"\n\nRue adds, \"Cloudflare is critically important to our ability to securely scale, and it fits in with the rest of our stack beautifully. As extensive as our Cloudflare integration already is, we've only just started. We have many more potential use cases where Cloudflare is the best tool for the job.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Computex uses Cloudflare Magic Transit and Spectrum to block DDoS attacks and meet critical SLAs",
						"longDescription": "## __Computex enhance its Managed Security offering by adding Cloudflare Magic Transit to protect its clients against DDoS attacks__\n\nComputex is a global solutions, cybersecurity, managed security services, and managed services provider with offices throughout North America and customers supported globally. Headquartered in Houston, Computex has been awarded Houston's #1 cybersecurity company for multiple years by the Houston Business Journal. Through their managed services offering they provide a wide range of services, from managed infrastructure (infrastructure as a service) to Security Operations Center (SOC)-as-a-Service, to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large enterprises alike. Computex currently manages 65,000 users and serves over 1,000 companies. \n\nAs a large cybersecurity company, their main goal is to protect their customers' businesses and keep them secure from attacks. \n\n### __Challenge: DDoS attacks endanger core services__\n\nComputex is rapidly expanding, moving from a national footprint to supporting businesses around the world. With this growth comes increased visibility to attackers and the need to protect the services and infrastructure that they host for their customers against cyber threats.\n\nDistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are growing more common and sophisticated. For Computex, a DDoS attack could significantly impact its ability to provide core services to its customers as the company hosts its customers' infrastructure and provides SSL VPNs to customers.\n\n### __Cloudflare Magic Transit intelligently mitigates DDoS attacks__\n\nComputex previously had a DDoS prevention solution, but it did not meet the needs of the business. The solution required frequent monitoring and configuration changes to protect Computex's infrastructure against more sophisticated DDoS threats.\n\nFor a more sustainable solution, Computex turned to Cloudflare. Oscar Morales, SOC Manager at Computex, says, \"I really appreciated the documentation that was provided to us. It was easy to understand what data points Cloudflare needed from us and what we needed to do to ensure that we configured and set up everything correctly and efficiently.\"\n\nComputex also saw value in working with the Cloudflare team directly during implementation. \"We had a very good experience with Cloudflare,\" says Kuoan Lee, Vice President of Infrastructure. \"Our account team was on the phone with us every day to help us fine tune and succeed.\" \n\nAfter deploying Magic Transit, Computex no longer needed to constantly monitor and react to protect against evolving DDoS threats. According to Morales, \"Cloudflare Magic Transit automatically adapts to threats and mitigates them. It also provides feedback and analytics so that we can make the best decisions as a business.\"\n\nFor Computex, DDoS attacks were an existential threat to their business. A successful attack could cause the company to miss service-level agreements (SLAs), costing them customers and money. Additionally, a successful attack could carry significant remediation costs in terms of cyber insurance, public relations, and post-incident forensic security assessments.\n\nMagic Transit provides ongoing cost savings and peace of mind to Computex by eliminating the fear of DDoS attacks. Morales says, \"This eliminates the need to have resources sitting around and continuously monitor 24/7. It's great to have Cloudflare doing that for us, because I just get a report saying, 'We mitigated this much DDoS traffic today.'\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Spectrum provides protection against application-layer DDoS attacks__\n\nModern DDoS attacks commonly combine layer 3/4 and layer 7 attacks. Network-level monitoring and DDoS protection are not enough to mitigate these threats. According to Adam Klimko, Sr. Director of Solution Architects at Computex, \"Trying to filter out good traffic from bad traffic, just based on origin, is difficult. There just isn't anything unique about any of the packets from good attackers and bad attackers at layer 3 or 4 because attacks happen more at the application layer.\"\n\nComputex hosts SSL VPN, DNS, email, and other services for its customers and needs deep visibility into this traffic to detect and filter DDoS traffic. \"That's why we enabled Spectrum,\" Morales says. Cloudflare Spectrum is a reverse proxy service that protects TCP and UDP applications from DDoS attacks without impairing performance. \"Because of the nature of our business and the criticality of those services, it just made sense for us. Otherwise, we weren't using the right tool for the right situations.\"\n\n### __Securing customers with Cloudflare solutions__ \n\nComputex's top priority is upholding the responsibility of keeping their customers' businesses secure and protected, and Faisal Bhutto, President of Cloud & Cybersecurity at Computex, believes providing DDoS protection via Magic Transit and Spectrum is critical to achieving that goal and the ability to deliver to their customers the best of breed solution. He says, \"Cloudflare is an intelligent solution that understands your environment and adapts over time. It's a resilient and comprehensive solution with a team that is invested in supporting their customers through not only the sales cycle, but also through implementation and adoption.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare provides Platzi's growing global online learning platform with Zero Trust security and streamlined development",
						"longDescription": "## __Platzi partners with Cloudflare to implement Zero Trust remote access, optimize development processes, and mitigate malicious bots__\n\nPlatzi is a global professional education platform that helps over two million students worldwide acquire new, in-demand job skills in marketing, business, design, and information technology. The company operates completely remotely, with employees in 17 different countries. In addition to its own course catalog, Platzi creates employee training courses for large corporations, including Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, and Google. The company also hosts video conferences and live-streaming events for the tech industry.\n\n### __Challenge: Replace a burdensome VPN with a Zero Trust solution and mitigate malicious bot traffic__\n\nPrior to using Cloudflare, Platzi used a VPN to provide remote access to internal resources for instructors and other employees. However, the VPN was complex and time-consuming to manage. End users found it difficult to use, and the internal help desk spent a lot of time dealing with tickets related to VPN deployment, configuration, and troubleshooting. Additionally, the VPN did not support security best practices fundamental to Zero Trust, including default-deny, least-privilege access, and role-based access control. It was also difficult to disable access for former employees.\n\nPlatzi also struggled with malicious bot traffic, which was degrading performance and threatening platform security overall. The tool they were using generated too many false positives.\n\nHaving had prior success using the Cloudflare performance and security suite, Platzi upgraded their subscription. Platzi added Cloudflare Access, which enables remote users to securely connect to internal resources, and Cloudflare Bot Management, which uses global threat intelligence and machine learning to block malicious bot traffic. To streamline development processes, Platzi also added Cloudflare Workers, an edge-based serverless computing platform built on the Cloudflare network. Workers allows developers to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones with custom code at the Internet edge, without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. \n\n### __Cloudflare Access provides Platzi with no-hassle Zero Trust remote access__\n\nAfter years of struggling with its VPN, Platzi was highly motivated to transform its remote access approach while employees worked from home during the pandemic. After deploying Cloudflare Access, complaints from end users about remote login issues came to a near halt. Access now protects hundreds of Platzi's internal web-based resources and streamlines the authentication experience for their global workforce of instructors, developers, and other employees.\n\n\"Cloudflare Access is an amazing alternative to traditional VPNs,\" says Ronald Escalona, Head of Cloud Engineering at Platzi. \"Users just open their browsers and log in, without having to download and configure additional software.\"\n\nCloudflare has also bolstered employee productivity while moving Platzi closer to a Zero Trust security model. Access makes it easy for Platzi to set up accounts for new hires, disable accounts for departing employees, and configure role-based access controls with least-privilege access -- all with just a few clicks in the dashboard. When users need their login credentials reset, Platzi no longer has to generate new certificates, as VPNs require.\n\n\"Cloudflare's flexibility and ease of use enabled Platzi to achieve Zero Trust remote access with minimal effort,\" Ronald explains. \"It's Zero Trust in a box -- it just works!\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers streamlines back-end development processes__\n\nPlatzi uses Cloudflare Workers for several different use cases, including optimizing their cache and serving users customized content based on their location.\n\n\"It took us only about an hour to write a Workers script to route site traffic according to a user's country code,\" Ronald says. \"Without Workers, that job would have taken two weeks.\" \n\nFuture projects with Workers include optimizing Platzi's testing platform to automate repetitive manual processes and facilitate feedback loops between operations and development teams. This will allow iterative updates to be deployed faster to applications in production.\n\n\"Our back-end developers absolutely love Workers,\" Ronald says. \"They can easily write scripts to automate processes, enabling them to integrate code and deploy applications much faster.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management filters out bad bots while hardening defenses against DDoS attacks__\n\nPlatzi had used Cloudflare distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Cloudflare Rate Limiting to mitigate DDoS attacks. The addition of Bot Management hardened Platzi's existing defenses against DDoS while helping them mitigate attacks from other types of bad bots, all without blocking legitimate traffic.\n\n\"Our previous bot mitigation solution produced a lot of false positives. Cloudflare Bot Management is far more accurate,\" Ronald explains. \"The Bot Score is particularly helpful to discerning legitimate traffic from bot attacks.\"\n\nPlatzi is so happy with the Cloudflare solutions and pace of innovation that instructors bring up Cloudflare during their own cybersecurity classes. The company looks forward to continued expansion of its partnership with Cloudflare.\n\n\"We've dedicated an internal lab to evaluating new Cloudflare solutions as they come out,\" Ronald says. \"We're delighted with how Cloudflare is continually enhancing existing products and launching new ones.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "KUKA relies on Cloudflare solutions to automatically identify and block cyberattacks and improve the performance of its key web properties",
						"longDescription": "## __KUKA deploys Cloudflare to improve web performance and security for corporate web properties__\n\nKUKA was founded in 1898 to manufacture lighting products for homes and city streets in Germany. In its over 120-year history, the company has repeatedly transformed itself to meet the needs of the modern market. Today, KUKA is a global automation corporation headquartered in Augsburg, Germany. As one of the world's leading suppliers of intelligent automation solutions, KUKA offers customers everything they need from a single source: from robots and cells to fully automated systems and their networking in markets such as automotive, electronics, metal & plastic, consumer goods, e-commerce/retail, and healthcare.\n\n### __Challenge: Frequent attacks impacted KUKA's website performance__\n\nKUKA was facing an increasing volume of application-layer attacks that impacted the accessibility of its corporate website. As with all major enterprises, website outages and performance problems had the potential to negatively impact brand image and the ability of current and potential customers to contact KUKA.\n\nPrior to implementing Cloudflare, the KUKA team faced the daunting task of manually analyzing and mitigating attacks. As a result, the IT staff was spending significant time and effort remediating these threats. \n\nRelying on manual incident response resulted in greater performance degradation and impact to the company than if the attacks were handled automatically. According to Alexander Bronnhuber, Head of IT Services (Digital Marketing, Application Lifecycle Management and Production IT) at KUKA, \"Every hour that our website is down, we would lose a considerable amount of leads that don't go to our CRM system. While this doesn't impact production, it hurts our marketing and customer experience.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare solutions provide vital visibility and threat prevention__\n\nAfter deploying Cloudflare WAF, KUKA saw a dramatic improvement in its ability to detect and mitigate attacks on its website. Christian Fürst, Project Architect at KUKA, says, \"With Cloudflare, we actually see more attacks because Cloudflare is picking up low-level attacks that we were missing before.\"\n\nRemediating these threats has also become much easier for KUKA. In the past, the team manually collected and analyzed raw logs and traffic flow data to identify threats. Now, the data is automatically collected, analyzed, and displayed in the Cloudflare dashboard. According to Bronnhuber, this has dramatically reduced the time spent handling these attacks. He says, \"We work in three-week sprints, and we sometimes would spend one man-week of time per sprint mitigating attacks. Now, maybe twice a month we see an attack that requires someone to manually block an IP address in the Cloudflare dashboard.\"\n\nThe protection provided by the Cloudflare network also makes incident response faster and easier. In the past, an attack could cause KUKA's servers to become less responsive, making it difficult to collect data and make the necessary changes. Now, attacks are blocked before they reach KUKA's systems, improving server performance and making manual data collection and attack remediation unnecessary.\n\n### __Cloudflare offers threat prevention, network performance optimization, and unmatched customer service__\n\nKUKA selected Cloudflare after performing a proof-of-concept comparison against other solutions. While Cloudflare was not the only solution to fully meet KUKA's functional requirements, it distinguished itself as the best overall package, including automated threat detection and response and improved web application performance. One major differentiator in the comparison was Argo Smart Routing. With Argo enabled, Cloudflare delivered a 45% improvement in response time consistency thanks to optimized traffic routing. They also saw an average of 11.5% improvement in time-to-first-byte and, for traffic from remote locations, the time-to-first-byte was even faster by 25% - thanks to the global Cloudflare network.\n\nIn addition to its rich feature set, the company culture at Cloudflare was a major selling point for KUKA. According to Rainer Stein, Project Manager, \"When you evaluate IT solutions and realize a potential supplier isn't really interested in working on equal footing with you, maybe you shouldn't work together in the first place. Cloudflare feels like part of the KUKA team.\"\n\nCloudflare won in terms of usability as well. Bronnhuber says, \"You click on the dashboard, and you'll immediately get a feeling about how the software works. I didn't have to do any training to start working with the system.\"\n\n### __Supporting a culture of innovation__\n\nKUKA is known for its inventive culture and ability to adapt to market needs. By partnering with Cloudflare, KUKA ensures that its corporate websites are accessible to its customers and are armed with protections against evolving cyber threats. Fürst says, \"Cloudflare is in tune with the way we work: agile and outcome-driven. Their solutions and support save valuable time and allow us to put the focus back on really advancing rather than just defending our status quo against attacks.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __One Mount Group partners with Cloudflare to embrace Zero Trust and go \"all-cloud\"__\n\n- __VinShop__, a dedicated retail app enabling independent shop owners to grow their business via tech enabled supply chain and inventory management.\n- __VinID__, a super app and Vietnam's largest consumer loyalty program integrating many functions such as payment, housing management, goods purchase, and financial services.\n- __OneHousing__, a one-stop destination for all needs in housing, supporting buying, selling, investing, and other real-estate related services.\n\n### __Challenge: Transition from on-premise security appliances to cloud-based Zero Trust solutions__\n\nSince its early days, One Mount Group has prioritized investing in cloud infrastructure and SaaS tools. However, it maintained its on-premise VPN, which enabled remote access to corporate resources. As the company grew and remote work became the norm, this appliance created frustrations that became too pressing to ignore.\n\nThe VPN was time-consuming for One Mount's IT staff to configure and troubleshoot, and it could be unreliable or slow, particularly for traffic to SaaS apps. Applying controls to specific apps or user groups could be so tedious that admins sometimes granted \"access to everything,\" opening the organization up to the threats of lateral movement. \n\nLonger term, One Mount Group recognized it had to reduce this excessive trust and adopt default-deny best practices that would better enable the organization to embrace remote work and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives. \n\nOne Mount Group had used Cloudflare's performance services since its founding to protect its external web properties, and it saw an opportunity to extend security to its internal operations by implementing Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform. Specifically, this platform -- called Cloudflare Zero Trust -- includes a Zero Trust Network Access solution to protect apps across cloud, on-prem, and SaaS environments, and a Secure Web Gateway solution to [protect users from threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) on the Internet.\n\nAdditionally, to facilitate code customizations that would further enhance performance and security, One Mount added Cloudflare Workers, which provides developers with a serverless execution environment that enables them to create entirely new applications or augment existing apps with custom code at the edge, without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. \n\n### __Cloudflare Zero Trust secures remote connections and provides One Mount with a solid foundation for Zero Trust__\n\nOne Mount started its Zero Trust journey by protecting internal web-based applications and over time, progressively secured a greater volume and variety of apps. Recently, this included leveraging Cloudflare's forward-proxy capabilities to streamline authentication for traditional resources like file sharing that were previously accessible only \"on-the-network\" in a One Mount office. \n\nToday, One Mount protects hundreds of applications for hundreds of employees, freelancers, and contractors and anticipates reducing its VPN usage entirely in the near future. Going forward, the organization is aiming to automate nearly all the workflows it takes to [protect applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) with an infrastructure-as-code approach that Cloudflare supports.\n\n\"Adopting Zero Trust was a very simple choice. Our vision is to be an 'all-internet company' and have everything in the cloud,\" says Phạm Anh Liêm, Director of Cybersecurity. \"We do not want to be limited by a corporate network perimeter. That's why Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform has been such a strong fit for us.\"\n\nOne Mount has particularly valued Cloudflare's flexibility to onboard multiple identity providers (IdPs) simultaneously. Cloudflare makes building group- and identity-based policies straightforward, particularly compared to the tedious, error-prone process of configuring a VPN.\n\n\"Cloudflare has saved us lots of time,\" says Liêm. \"Whenever we build a new application, it's so simple and easy to add protections based on our IdP of choice.\"\n\nThat same flexibility for IdP integration extends to integrations with endpoint protection (EPP) software. Specifically, One Mount uses Cloudflare's integration with its preferred EPP provider to set up device-aware, least privilege access policies. Extending visibility and security with this integration is empowering One Mount to fully embrace BYOD, and One Mount plans to roll out Cloudflare's device client to all employee endpoints by the end of 2021.\n\n\"With so many remote workers, you cannot trust every device, so we need to ensure that every request coming to our systems is validated with the right factors before granting them access,\" says Liêm.\n\nOne Mount is extending this Zero Trust approach to Internet browsing by applying filters and extending visibility to their users' outbound connections. Prior to Cloudflare, users were only protected from malware and risky Internet destinations while working in local offices.\n\n\"We want our employees to be secure on the Internet at any time and anywhere, not just when they're on the corporate network,\" says Liêm.\n\nAs the company grows, One Mount is excited to scale its cloud-based Zero Trust approach with Cloudflare. \n\n\"We are one of the first companies in Vietnam which offers fully public cloud-hosted financial services,\" says Liêm,\" and Cloudflare is a crucial partner in achieving our Zero Trust aspirations.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers enables One Mount to easily solve complex problems with custom code run at the edge__\n\nOne Mount uses the Cloudflare Workers serverless platform for a variety of use cases, including offloading backend processing, handling uncommon but high-volume tasks, and building perimeter security solutions for dynamic access control, dynamic IP allow-listing, and fraud detection. Nearly all of these use cases are critical to the company's internal operations.\n\n\"Workers provides us with the essential elements we need to tackle our toughest use cases,\" notes Phạm Anh Liêm. \"It's a great choice for our serverless solutions needs.\"\n\nOne Mount has integrated Workers with the Cloudflare WAF and DDoS mitigation to prevent fraud during special promotions. For example, One Mount holds virtual promotions where millions of users compete in a short period of time to obtain promotion vouchers or purchase limited-edition products. By using Workers to integrate custom code with the WAF and DDoS protection, One Mount ensures that attackers can't use automated scripts to snap up the vouchers or products, leaving legitimate customers empty-handed.\n\nCloudflare Workers enables One Mount to easily utilize the processing power at the point nearest to end users to run the logic, then use the Cloudflare WAF to block abusive activity — all without concern about scaling the underlying infrastructure. Without Workers, it would be extremely difficult for One Mount to design, implement, and automatically scale these protections on their backend without impacting the user experience. \n\n\"Workers lets our developers write code and see results immediately,\" notes Phạm Anh Liêm. \"It's dramatically reduced our development and operating costs and has made a big difference in the way we build our products.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Kinsta uses Cloudflare solutions to prevent DDoS attacks and provide a premium tailored hosting experience",
						"longDescription": "## __Kinsta uses Cloudflare technology to deliver premium cloud-hosted solutions that are secure and fast__\n\n[Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/) is a provider of tailored cloud hosting to tens of thousands of organizations in 128 countries. The company was founded in 2013 with the idea that hosting should be feature-rich, powerful, fast, and secure — and that support should be exceptional.\n\nInitially famous for its [Managed WordPress Hosting](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-hosting/), Kinsta's offerings also include [Application Hosting](https://kinsta.com/application-hosting/), [Database Hosting](https://kinsta.com/database-hosting/), and [Static Site Hosting](https://kinsta.com/static-site-hosting/) — all fronted by Cloudflare. Using the fastest machines on the Google Cloud Platform for WordPress, Application, and Database Hosting, Kinsta's services have been winning awards for years. The company is regularly ranked near the top of the Managed Hosting category of G2's crowdsourced reviews, and in 2023 was ranked third across G2's Satisfaction, Popularity, and Easiest to Use ratings. Kinsta has also earned recognition as a leader or high performer in G2's Europe Regional Grid, Mid-Market Grid, Small Business Grid, and Momentum Grid.\n\n### __The initial challenge: Highly visible websites create DDoS risks__\n\nKinsta was already hosting tens of thousands of websites — ranging from small businesses to global enterprises — when it first turned to Cloudflare for protection from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Many of Kinsta's customers have high profiles, making them popular targets for cybercriminals. While the company had in-house DDoS mitigation solutions, handling attacks was expensive and required significant time and manual effort by system administrators. DDoS attacks also caused noticeable downtime, which was undesirable for Kinsta and its customers.\n\n### __Cloudflare eliminates the threat of DDoS attacks__\n\nKinsta's in-house DDoS mitigation solution was built using load balancers hosted on Google's platform. Using a combination of automated scripts and manual tuning, this in-house infrastructure could mitigate most attacks with minimal downtime for customers. However, a DDoS attack against one site could affect other customers behind the same load balancer.\nManaging DDoS attacks in-house also took personnel away from other tasks — a problem eliminated by a switch to Cloudflare DDoS protection. Jenna Recktenwald, a DevOps engineer at Kinsta, says, \"I remember some days when it would take two or three admins per shift to handle a DDoS attack or even multiple ones. Now, we just get alerts from Cloudflare saying that it has detected an attack and is mitigating it.\"\n\nCloudflare DDoS protection has stopped thousands of attacks for Kinsta. For customer sites protected by Cloudflare, DDoS attacks have become a non-event. According to Recktenwald, \"We have Cloudflare DDoS alerts sent to our Slack channel. When we get an alert about an in-progress attack that Cloudflare is mitigating, our sysadmins will just acknowledge it and move on.\"\nThe switch to Cloudflare has enabled Kinsta to eliminate its Google-hosted load-balancing infrastructure, which has dramatically simplified the process of applying updates. In the past, sysadmins needed to coordinate updates across more than 100 load balancers to ensure a smooth rollout. Now, updates require only a single configuration change or a tweak to some code and are automatically rolled out across Cloudflare's infrastructure.\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers enables customized cloud hosting at scale__\n\nKinsta's rapid growth — including adding new services like Application Hosting and Database Hosting — has made scalability even more critical. Kinsta has containerized its hosting infrastructure, which decreases overhead and improves reliability and scalability. However, containerization has made routing more complex, since routing traffic to a particular container requires specifying that container's IP address and port.\n\nCloudflare Workers, a next-generation development service, makes it possible for Kinsta to implement the necessary routing logic for customer domains hosting WordPress sites, applications, or static content.  Each domain  Kinsta manages has a record in Workers KV (key-value) that stores the necessary routing information. Inbound traffic is processed by a Cloudflare Workers script that looks up the relevant record and routes the traffic to the appropriate location.\n\nWith Workers and Workers KV, Kinsta is also able to apply custom settings for each domain. Says Recktenwald, \"There was no good way for us to scale before we started using Cloudflare Workers. By storing data in Workers KV and manipulating requests before they reach the server and on their way back, we can just turn on or off so many features for our clients.\"\n\nAmong those features, Kinsta has made use of Cloudflare's cache customization options (including Cache API) to offer its clients static CDN as well as dynamic Edge Cache. These features helped Kinsta slash website loading times in half.\n\nKinsta also offers their customers more speed-enhancement options by combining Workers with Cloudflare features like image optimization, code minification, and Early Hints — the latter of which preemptively sends browsers website rendering information.\n\nOverall, Workers has become a vital part of how Kinsta provides value to its customers. Each month, Cloudflare Workers handles more than 69 billion requests from Kinsta's infrastructure.\n\n### __SSL for SaaS simplifies certificate management and improves site performance__\n\nKinsta hosts over 100,000 domains for its customers. Previously, it managed SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt, but updating a certificate required a manual rollout to each load balancer supporting its domain. Doing so across all of Kinsta's infrastructure usually required a couple of hours' work by a system administrator.\n\nAccording to Recktenwald, \"After making the switch to Cloudflare for DDoS protection, using SSL for SaaS was a no-brainer.\" SSL for SaaS automates the SSL certificate creation process, eliminating a task for system administrators and support tickets from customers struggling with updates.\nThe switch to SSL for SaaS even improved load times for customer sites by as much as 40%.\n\n### __Enabling Kinsta to deliver exceptional service__\n\nBy automating the process of protecting against DDoS, managing SSL certificates, caching content, and hosting static sites, Cloudflare helps Kinsta concentrate on its customers and continue growing. Daniel Pataki, Kinsta's CTO, says, \"Everything that we do is focused on building a solution that can scale while providing the level of service that our customers expect. Cloudflare solutions give us that scalability and free up our teams' time and energy to focus on proactive features and solutions.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Quickbutik secures and supports a rapidly growing ecommerce platform with Cloudflare__\n\nLaunched in 2015, Quickbutik is a platform that helps small ecommerce businesses grow. The company focuses on providing the right apps and integrating them in a user-friendly way —  eliminating the need to spend time on the technical side of running an [ecommerce store](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/). \n\n### __Challenge: Rapid growth causes scalability challenges__\n\nQuickbutik is growing rapidly, with over 5,000 ecommerce stores across the Nordic region on its platform. This expanding user base comes with greater overhead expenses and resources, since the company needs to ensure the availability, [performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/), and security of its customers' sites. Additionally, the company is increasingly exposed to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and other threats.\n\nQuickbutik wanted to focus on improving its platform and customer experience, and ensure it could continue to scale to meet demand. It needed a partner that could eliminate the pain points of scaling and provide enterprise-level security to its customers.\n\n### __Taking the anxiety out of scaling__\n\nThe primary scaling challenge that Quickbutik faced was managing its customers' SSL certificates. The use of TLS for data encryption is essential for compliance with PCI DSS and requires SSL certificates to be deployed and regularly renewed for every ecommerce site's custom domains. Previously, the company handled SSL certificates in-house using its own proxies and certificate rotation code hosted on AWS infrastructure.\n\nAs the number of stores on the Quickbutik platform grew, this infrastructure became more difficult to manage. Hosting over 5,000 ecommerce stores meant that Quickbutik was managing tens of thousands of SSL certificates. In some cases, these certificates required custom rules for rollout or rotation, which added further complexity.\n\nQuickbutik replaced its in-house solution with Cloudflare's SSL for SaaS, which enables painless certificate generation for their customers' custom domains. Now, the process for creating certificates for customers' custom domains, which previously took ten to fifteen minutes, completes in under a minute — a more than 90% improvement.\n\nSimplifying certificate management also allowed Quickbutik to accomplish its goal of focusing more on improving its platform rather than maintaining it. According to Azddin Benberkan, Quickbutik's founder, \"With SSL for SaaS, our engineers can really work on the product now, focusing on the value that we provide rather than platform maintenance. SSL for SaaS provides huge savings of their time and effort.\"\n\n### __Providing enterprise-level security for small ecommerce brands__\n\nIn the past, Quickbutik used in-house tools to prevent bot traffic and DDoS attacks. However, as the visibility of Quickbutik and its customers grew, larger-scale and more targeted attacks became more of a concern.\n\nThe switch to Cloudflare WAF and DDoS Protection have given Quickbutik invaluable visibility into the attacks being performed against its customers' sites. According to Benberkan, \"The DDoS attack numbers in the Cloudflare console are way higher than we saw in our own tools because we detected that as normal traffic.\"\n\nCloudflare solutions block about six million attacks per month against the stores on the Quickbutik platform. Benberkan says, \"It is really awesome to be able to provide enterprise-level protection to our customers.\"\n\n### __Implementing Zero Trust remote access with Cloudflare Access__\n\nQuickbutik is also looking to Cloudflare to secure its remote workforce. \n\nAs an initial response to the pandemic, the company adopted a VPN to enable remote access for employees to internal resources. The VPN, however, has proven \"buggy\" and \"unstable,\" with employees encountering latency and losing connection to their tools after they had already authenticated. \n\nCloudflare Access will enable Quickbutik to depreciate its VPN usage and deliver a more seamless, more performant experience for its employees. In particular, onboarding new members of its growing workforce will require less setup and deployment effort with Access than with the current VPN.\n\n\"With Cloudflare Access, we can get people connected and working securely regardless of where they are and how they connect,\" says Benberkan.\n\nPlus, unlike a VPN, Access follows default-deny, identity-aware best practices that will enable the organization to improve its security approach.\n\n\"Our responsibility is the integrity and safety of the data we see and tools we use to work,\" says Benberkan. \"Cloudflare helps us ensure that high level of safety.\"\n\n### __Preparing Quickbutik for future growth__\n\nBefore partnering with Cloudflare, scaling was a significant concern for Quickbutik. Now, that anxiety is gone. Benberkan says, \"When you grow, you don't want the technical details of platform maintenance to get in the way of creating value for your customers. Cloudflare takes away the anxiety of scaling the business and enables us to focus on building new features.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare's security suite is an important component of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's security model",
						"longDescription": "## __Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) chooses Cloudflare as its Zero Trust security partner__\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, otherwise known as Berkeley Lab, is a Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory, managed by the University of California.  Berkeley Lab conducts open scientific research intended for publication across both fundamental and applied scientific domains. The Lab is located adjacent to the University of California, Berkeley, and it is closely affiliated with the university. In addition to Berkeley Lab's 5,000 employees, students and researchers from all over the world perform research on-site and electronically access the lab's resources.\n\n### __Challenge: Secure a decentralized web server architecture and implement more rigorous application access policies__\n\nAlthough it conducts research for the U.S. DOE, Berkeley Lab more closely resembles a research and education institute, not a government agency. While other government organizations focus heavily on restricting access, Berkeley Lab's goal is to make its information as accessible as possible to the researchers who need it, while at the same time protecting its systems from abuse.\n\nBerkeley Lab's IT infrastructure is decentralized, with thousands of on-prem and cloud web servers operated by and for different scientific projects and collaborations. For some time, Berkeley Lab was challenged by visibility into cloud assets, in particular web servers that were subject to defacements or other attacks.  \n\nBerkeley Lab attempted to mitigate the attacks through penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, but these methods proved resource intensive. After considering security tools from several vendors, Berkeley Lab signed up for Cloudflare's security and performance suite, which includes the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), Cloudflare Content Delivery Network (CDN) and Load Balancing.\n\nHowever, that was just Phase 1, and Berkeley Lab turned to Cloudflare again when new challenges emerged and existing Cloudflare services offered an easy opportunity to address them:\n\n- Cloudflare Access, which uses a Zero Trust model to help teams secure enterprise applications with better performance, security, and privacy than a traditional VPN.\n- Cloudflare Rate Limiting, which helps protect against Distributed-Denial-of-Service attacks, vulnerability scanning, and reconnaissance.\n- Super Bot Fight Mode, which can block malicious automated attacks early, inexpensively, and at scale, giving Cloudflare-protected resources \"herd immunity\" against them.\n\n### __Cloudflare WAF provides Berkeley Lab with complete visibility and control over hundreds of web servers__\n\nThe Cloudflare WAF enables Berkeley Lab to monitor and control traffic to its cloud-hosted resources, including traditional VMs, SaaS, and serverless apps as well as on-premises devices. Berkeley Lab uses the WAF as a reverse proxy for both HTTP and HTTPS, which has allowed them to regain critical visibility that's been lost with encryption. Because the lab is proxying the web server to the client, they can also terminate TLS connections at Cloudflare's edge, enabling them to meet BOD 18-01 requirements without making changes at their origin servers.\n\nThe WAF blocks over 2 million threats each month from reaching Berkeley Lab's primary domain, lbl.gov. In addition, the WAF's logging capabilities are essential to securing the lab's extensive distributed data environment, since log data can be fed directly into its intrusion detection system (IDS).\n\nCloudflare's logging capabilities also aligned with the lab's goal of pervasive visibility across their systems\n\nBerkeley Labs still does automated security scanning, but their web environment is constantly changing. Each change could introduce a vulnerability, and they are unable to scan every server every day. By using a cloud-based WAF, the lab is able to stop cybercriminals from taking advantage of vulnerabilities they haven't yet found, which lets them be more proactive than reactive with their security.\n\n### __Cloudflare Access supports Berkeley Lab's Zero Trust architecture__\n\nPrior to implementing Cloudflare Access, employees could only access certain self-hosted tools - like Berkeley Lab's office supply procurement system - on-premises. This became problematic when the COVID-19 pandemic forced more employees to work remotely, and more users were relying on the VPN for remote application access. \n\nBerkeley Lab still offers a full-tunnel VPN today for visibility purposes, but Cloudflare Access is being used to incrementally reduce reliance on it for application access. Critical enterprise applications ranging from the procurement system to HR information system, as well as groundbreaking scientific projects are protected by Cloudflare Access, and users don't need a VPN to access them. Instead, users connect to these resources through a regular web browser. As requests are routed and accelerated through Cloudflare's edge, they are evaluated against Zero Trust rules incorporating signals from Berkeley Lab's identity providers, devices, and other contexts. \n\nCloudflare Access enables employees to easily and securely access tools like procurement systems from any location, through any web browser, and it lets Berkeley Lab monitor their usage of protected systems. Their employees were able to migrate seamlessly from their VPN to Access without much notice.\n\nCloudflare Access is integrated with their identity provider, which allows Berkeley Lab to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on legacy applications that didn't natively support it. This helped them get ahead of the curve on compliance with the [White House Executive Order that mandates MFA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) for federal agencies and contractors. MFA is also a key component of a Zero Trust security architecture.\n\nBerkeley Lab had been thinking about Zero Trust Architectures for a very long time, and Cloudflare Access was able to give them the ability to enact it. \n\nBerkeley Lab is still in the process of replacing its VPN with Cloudflare Access throughout the organization. The Lab predicts that within a year, Access will have replaced their VPN for the vast majority of users. \n\nBy combining Berkeley Lab's existing protocols with Access and the rest of the Cloudflare security suite, they are able to make good progress on their zero-trust journey.\n\n### __Cloudflare's security and performance solutions are deployed organization-wide__\n\nIn addition to the Cloudflare WAF and Access, Berkeley Lab uses Cloudflare Rate Limiting, Super Bot Fight Mode, and Cloudflare's performance suite, which includes the Cloudflare CDN and Load Balancing.\n\nCloudflare Rate Limiting and Cloudflare Super Bot Fight Mode enable Berkeley Lab to prevent automated traffic and malicious bots from attacking their systems and straining network resources.\n\nCloudflare's security and performance solutions are deployed organization-wide. Berkeley Lab's business systems group, which operates the human resources, finance, and other enterprise systems, used Cloudflare Load Balancing to replace on-premises hardware that was expensive, time-consuming to manage, and represented a single point of failure.\n\nThe Cloudflare CDN serves approximately 2TB of Berkeley Lab's traffic from cache each month, saving the lab valuable bandwidth that its researchers can use for compute-intensive research activities.\n\nAfter implementing the Cloudflare CDN and Load Balancing, the lab was able to see significant improvements in their WordPress hosts. \n",

						"shortDescription": "ezCater partners with Cloudflare for Zero Trust remote access and malicious bot defense.",
						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps ezCater move closer to Zero Trust while mitigating malicious bots__\n\nFounded in 2007 in Boston, Massachusetts, ezCater is the largest national marketplace for business catering with 80,000+ restaurants and caterers and 155+ million people served. ezCater provides companies of all sizes, anywhere in the country, with flexible and scalable food solutions for work. Nationwide, restaurants and caterers use ezCater's platform to grow and manage their catering business.  \n\n### __Challenges: Mitigate increasingly frequent bot attacks, and secure remote connections to internal resources without a VPN__\n\nezCater began its relationship with Cloudflare by adopting the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Content Delivery Network (CDN). As ezCater grew from a local startup to a national company, its security needs evolved, and the company began moving towards a Zero Trust security architecture. When the COVID-19 pandemic forced all of ezCater's employees to work remotely, the company needed a simple, secure way for its globally distributed workforce to connect to internal resources while maintaining Zero Trust.\n\nAdditionally, ezCater had been using manual mitigation techniques, such as blocklists, to defend against malicious bots that were scraping website content, attempting takeovers of customer accounts, and degrading site performance. However, as bot attacks increased in frequency, ezCater's internal team had to devote increasing time and resources to managing these security rules. Conor Sherman, Head of Security, wanted an effective solution for managing malicious bots.\n\nSherman decided to deploy Cloudflare Bot Management, along with Cloudflare Access, a Zero Trust solution for enabling remote employees to securely connect to internal resources.\n\n### __Cloudflare Access gets ezCater closer to Zero Trust security and negates the need for a VPN__\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic began, ezCater — like many other businesses — had to find a way to enable and secure remote workforces practically overnight. Sherman wanted to implement a Zero Trust solution to this problem and avoid the complexity of a VPN, particularly since ezCater's workforce is globally distributed. \n\nezCater integrated Cloudflare Access with its single sign-on (SSO) identity provider, enabling the company to rapidly extend its existing Zero Trust architecture to its entire remote workforce. Today, approximately 600 ezCater employees use Access to log into internal resources. \n\n\"Cloudflare Access became available just in time to prevent us from having to go through the hassle of deploying a VPN,\" Sherman recalls. \"It was an easy choice for us, and Cloudflare Access was shockingly simple to deploy.\"\n\nIn addition to being more secure than a VPN, Access saves ezCater money because the company didn't have to hire another person to manage the VPN. Instead, Access is enabling ezCater's existing team to improve security organization-wide and move further towards a Zero Trust security model.\n\n\"The Zero Trust journey is a marathon, not a sprint,\" Sherman explains. \"Now that Cloudflare Access has provided us with Zero Trust at the identity layer, we're moving on to the endpoint layer and other areas.\"\n\nIn addition to Access' primary use case of securing remote connections to internal resources, Sherman is excited about Cloudflare's pace of innovation with Access and its other products.\n\n\"Cloudflare's culture of innovation truly excites me,\" Sherman says. \"Many companies will introduce a great product with a lot of fanfare, but then it tapers off. Access and the rest of Cloudflare's products only get better over time.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management simplifies ezCater's defenses while providing more effective and accurate protection__\n\nPrior to deploying Bot Management, ezCater's security team was continuously playing catch-up, writing new firewall rules to block the latest malicious bots. \n\nBot Management's machine learning-driven approach has significantly improved ezCater's defenses, enabling it to greatly simplify its firewall rules while enjoying more efficient and accurate bot mitigation. ezCater gets a lot of value out of Bot Management's Bot Scores, which use machine learning to determine the probability that a particular request is originating from a bot. \n\n\"The Bot Management Bot Scores let us take a more holistic approach to mitigating malicious bot traffic than firewall rules allow,\" Sherman says. \"We have the flexibility to defend our environment more precisely.\"\n\nAdditionally, Bot Management lets ezCater set up different risk profiles for different areas of its site, enabling the company to use a surgical approach to block bots. For example, ezCater's API endpoints are vulnerable to different types of bots than its login page or web forms.\n\n\"Bot Management lets us lean into Cloudflare's global threat intelligence, determine what and where our risks are, and craft defenses that target those specific risks,\" Sherman explains. \"We've been able to simplify our rule set while getting better protection.\"\n\n### __With Cloudflare as a security partner, ezCater can focus on its core competency__\n\nAs ezCater continues to expand in their market, they intend to rely more heavily on Cloudflare's innovation and make deeper use of Cloudflare products, particularly as ezCater gets further into its Zero Trust journey.\n\n\"Zero Trust is very important, but it's also incredibly difficult to implement,\" Sherman says. \"The only way ezCater can succeed with this is to have the right partner. Cloudflare has given us the foundation for a successful Zero Trust implementation.\"\n\nThanks to Cloudflare's security products protecting its marketplace from cyber attacks, ezCater is able to concentrate on its core competency: matching caterers and restaurants with organizations that need their services.\n\n\"If ezCater didn't have Cloudflare, we'd have a very bad day,\" Sherman says. \"We don't have time to become global security experts. With Cloudflare on our side, we can focus on what we're great at: food for work.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps PagesJaunes facilitate its digitalization process and offer its users improved protection and ease of access__\n\nPagesJaunes is a digital directory and local search service used by a large number of French companies. It is also a major player on the web and one of the most visited sites in France. PagesJaunes' services are available via mobile applications and on the web, allowing companies to increase their visibility by displaying and digitalizing their content. Above all else, its mission is to improve community life by connecting French individuals and businesses.\n\nPagesJaunes is also a registered trademark of Solocal. Solocal is among the European leaders in web advertising solutions and a specialist in the field of advertising, communications and digital marketing. In 2020, the company had more than 314,000 customers, with annual traffic of 2.4 billion visits. \n\n### __Challenge: improving security and performance after migrating to the cloud__\n\nTo support its business operations, PagesJaunes must manage a very large database with sensitive information on the companies listed there. This data must be kept secure, in order to comply with European data protection regulations.\n\nLoïc Troquet, Head of Architecture, Performance and Security at PagesJaunes, explains the main challenges facing the company: \"Many people are interested in our data. As a result, we often face large-scale attempts to copy our directory or to sell our data.\"\n\n\"Between 2018 and 2019, we migrated most of our on-premise servers to the cloud. This shift in infrastructure required even more protection than the solutions we already had in place,\" says Troquet. \"The digitalization of our services weighed heavily on our infrastructure. The loading times of our pages were sometimes excessive, especially for connections from overseas territories.\"\n\nThese problems led Troquet and his team to look for new solutions on the market. \"We considered several services but apart from Cloudflare, none of them were able to cover the entire spectrum combining security and performance,\" he explains. \n\nTroquet goes on to recount the beginnings of his cooperation with Cloudflare: \"Our exchanges were made easier because the technical teams are French-speaking. They understood our problem very well and were able to provide answers to our issues, which immediately put our minds at ease.\"\n\n### __Implementation of CDN & Cloudflare WAF & DDoS solutions__\n\nFollowing a proof of concept (PoC), PagesJaunes decided to implement Cloudflare solutions for the majority of its services. Thanks to the Cloudflare CDN (Content Delivery Network) they were able to limit incoming traffic, while ensuring the management of caches and DNS. This also allowed them to address the issues of certificate expiration and automatic renewal, which Solocal previously had to manage on their own.\n\n\"We quickly noticed that the traffic absorbed by the Cloudflare CDN meant that our infrastructure was less stressed and more resilient,\" insists Troquet. \"70% of the bandwidth no longer needed to be serviced by Solocal's infrastructure.\" This has reduced loading times for users of their services.\n\nTroquet presents the results obtained with other Cloudflare solutions, including those deployed to ensure digital security: \"We already had solutions in place, but none were as successful as Cloudflare. We regularly face DDoS or large-scale scraping attacks. Cloudflare protection automatically spots them and blocks them quickly,\" he says. \n\nIn conjunction with WAF and anti-scraping solutions, PagesJaunes succeeds in reducing the cyber risks that their pages previously faced: \"Cloudflare protection has resulted in millions of attacks stopped every month.\"\n\n### __Ease of use and implementation of Cloudflare solutions__\n\nSolocal has since expanded its scope of operation with Cloudflare, applying Cloudflare's security and performance solutions to 10 other sites such as ooreka.fr, ootravaux.fr and clicrdv.com. This expansion provided an opportunity to implement new solutions as well: \"We had more precise geolocation needs. Cloudflare Workers has helped us deliver more relevant content to our users as soon as they arrived on the site. The Cloudflare Argo smart routing solution is also more efficient for routing traffic from the search engines we work with (Google, Yahoo, Bing).\"\n\nTroquet explains that Cloudflare has provided other benefits: \"Some infrastructure update operations can be quite time-consuming, such as setting up HTTP/2 or switching to TLS 1.3. It was very easy to perform these tasks on Cloudflare with a few clicks from the administration console.\" \n\nCloudflare has thus optimized certain technical administration tasks of the pagesjaunes.fr site by reducing the number of steps required to perform these tasks. \n\nIn the future, Troquet hopes to intensify the collaboration with Cloudflare, in particular to study the opportunities offered by the wealth of features made available by Cloudflare.\n\n### __Cloudflare has allowed PagesJaunes to help local merchants during the health crisis__\n\n\"One of Cloudflare's main strengths is its ease of use. Cloudflare has allowed us to save time, in particular by reducing our administrative tasks.\"\n\nDespite the health crisis in 2020, Troquet remained positive. \"We have managed to provide localized and personalized online directories of regions and cities to facilitate the emergence of Click&Collect at a local level. Cloudflare has allowed us to quickly deploy the new digital directories and thus support local merchants.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps Bitpanda boost their app and IT security without performance trade-offs as they grow from small startup to major fintech player__ \n\nBitpanda makes investing accessible for everyone. Founded in 2014 in Vienna, Austria by Eric Demuth, Paul Klanschek and Christian Trummer, Bitpanda removes the barriers to investing by harnessing the innovative power of digitized assets and blockchain technology.\n\nWith more than 500 team members and over 2 million users, the company is one of Europe's fastest-growing fintechs.\n\nThe user-friendly, trade-everything platform empowers both first-time investors and seasoned experts to invest in the stocks, cryptocurrencies and metals they want — with any amount of money.\n\n### __Challenge: Mitigate increasingly frequent and severe DDoS and other automated attacks__ \n\nWhen Bitpanda started experiencing DDoS attacks, it had been in business for only about two months and had a very small customer base. To mitigate the attacks, Bitpanda signed up for the free plan on Cloudflare, which includes Cloudflare DNS, Cloudflare CDN, basic DDoS protection, and a limited number of Page Rules, which trigger certain actions whenever a request matches one of the URL patterns a user defines. As Bitpanda grew, it upgraded to a paid subscription and added Rate Limiting, which helps protect against DDoS and other automated cyber attacks.\n\nOver the past two years, Bitpanda experienced a significant growth spurt, and the company saw a corresponding rise in automated attacks against its APIs and customer accounts. Cyber criminals were scanning Bitpanda's APIs for vulnerabilities and launching credential-stuffing attacks against its customers. These automated attacks degraded performance and put customers at risk of account takeovers (ATOs).\n\nChristian Trummer, CTO and co-founder of Bitpanda, knew it was time for them to upgrade to a Cloudflare Enterprise plan, which offers the most robust toolset that Cloudflare has to offer, as well as 24/7, prioritized customer support by phone, chat, and email. Because Bitpanda was migrating to a Zero Trust security architecture, Trummer also added Cloudflare Access, which uses Zero Trust rules to help teams [secure corporate applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/). Access provides simple, secure access to digital assets in specialized use cases\n\nBitpanda leverages Cloudflare Access to restrict access to internal assets. For example, Bitpanda used Access when the company deployed a beta version of a certain product and needed to limit access to a select group of beta testers. \n\nPreviously, Bitpanda had used a VPN, which was complex to configure and maintain and difficult for end users to use. Access eliminated the administrative overhead associated with the VPN, freeing up Bitpanda's team to focus on internal projects instead of maintaining a VPN, and reduced the company's potential cyber attack surface.\n\n\"Access is much simpler and more secure than a VPN for limiting access to internal assets. We just activate it and add users,\" Trummer says. \"It just works!\"\n\nIn addition to authenticating users and preventing malicious actors from accessing Bitpanda's network, Access also gives the company visibility into user activity inside the system, which supports Bitpanda's Zero Trust model.\n\n\"Access provides us with Zero Trust user authentication, granular control over user access, and complete visibility into user activity,\" Trummer says. \"This is key to Zero Trust, which recognizes that threats can be internal as well as external.\"\n\n### __The Cloudflare security suite stops DDoS and other automated attacks that threaten both site performance and integrity of customer accounts__\n\nShortly before upgrading to Cloudflare Enterprise, Bitpanda experienced a massive DDoS attack that took its systems offline. When the internal team was unable to mitigate the attack on their own, Trummer contacted Cloudflare, and a support representative suggested adding some Page Rules, which stopped the attack. \n\n\"That attack was the catalyst for us to upgrade to Enterprise,\" Trummer recalls. \"Bitpanda had grown to the point where we needed the most comprehensive solution available, and there was no question that we were going to buy it from Cloudflare.\"\n\nSince upgrading, Trummer is elated that his team no longer has to spend so much time monitoring threats and [mitigating](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) them. Freed from having to engage in security monitoring and defense, Bitpanda's engineers can spend their time developing new products and enhancing current ones.\n\n\"I can't imagine not having Cloudflare as a security partner. Our software engineers want to spend time building products for our customers, so we need a partner with that expertise who can focus on security for us,\" Trummer says. \"Our cloud services provider offers a WAF and other security tools, but we haven't looked at them because we're so happy with Cloudflare. We have no reason to shop around.\"\n\nIn addition to the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), DDoS protection, Page Rules, and Rate Limiting, Bitpanda depends on Cloudflare DNS services to secure its domains from DNS attacks and keep its platform online. Prior to Cloudflare, Bitpanda had used another DNS provider, but they had several incidents where their DNS went offline for hours, and the provider's support team provided no help.\n\n\"They lost our trust,\" Trummer says. \"We trust Cloudflare to provide a secure environment. Over the years, Cloudflare has consistently provided us with professional, top-quality service, and I look forward to expanding our partnership as Bitpanda continues to grow.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Edgemesh uses Cloudflare Workers to reduce costs and improve performance of their client-side web optimization solutions__\n\nInstead of offering customers server-side optimization, Edgemesh speeds up the client side by optimizing cache hits at the Content Delivery Network (CDN) edge in the browser. Customers around the world can add a single line of code to their websites and reap the customer conversion benefits of improved website performance.\n\n### __Challenge: Client-side optimization requires a high-performance edge computing__\n\nEdgemesh takes a unique approach to website optimization by focusing on accelerating content via intelligent client-side optimizations. When combined with Cloudflare's industry leading server-side performance, Edgemesh enabled sites can load 20-50% faster with just a single line of code or a one click Cloudflare App. Edgemesh works by creating a dedicated client-side cache powered by the browser's Service Worker API. Instead of trying to predict the user's interactions with the site and prefetching the next page,  Edgemesh focuses on caching and prefetching the individual assets (fonts, JavaScript, CSS and images) that are most commonly used across all pages. By intelligently prefetching fonts, Javascript, and similar shared content that is not currently in the browser's local cache, Edgemesh helps a site load faster and stay faster automatically. With the increased performance push driven by recent search engine ranking factors (like Google's Core Web Vitals) , Edgemesh has seen a dramatic uptick in customer demand for it's low friction acceleration solution. \n\nAs a long-time customer of Cloudflare, Edgemesh eagerly tries out new products and features when they become available. \"Like many companies, Edgmesh grew up with Cloudflare. As the platform has expanded to new capabilities, we've been able to leverage these performance wins time and time again\" said Loveless. When Cloudflare Workers, an edge-based serverless platform, became available, along with Workers Key-Value (KV), and Cache API, Edgemesh saw an opportunity to overhaul and optimize their products with Workers. \"Wth Edgemesh version 4, we went all in with Cloudflare Workers. We completely redesigned how our customer facing API's worked, and we were able to move 95% of our solution to run on the edge.\"\n\n### __Workers improves API performance by five times and decreases computing costs by 72%__\n\nWorkers enables Edgemesh to move their code closer to the websites that use it. \"With Workers and Cache API, we've implemented 95% of our API at the Cloudflare network edge. Today, almost all the API endpoints that we use run on Workers.\"\n\nThe switch to Workers provided significant benefits to Edgemesh, and was completed by a team of three in less than 5 months. According to Edgemesh CTO Randy LeBeau, \"The vast majority of our software now runs on Cloudflare, and the performance benefits of that are pretty extreme. Our customer APIs are now 5x faster than the cloud hosted version. The management overhead has also dropped to the floor, with Cloudflare's elastic compute scaling up as needed - a critical feature that we need for times like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\"\n\nWorkers also enables Edgemesh to optimize and save money on their infrastructure. Loveless says, \"We need to be able to service clients, wherever they are on the globe. So prior to our port to workers - we had to have infrastructure hosted in the US, in Europe, in Southeast Asia. That meant paying a lot for infrastructure all just to get fast response times. Now that we've offloaded so much to Cloudflare, we cut our cloud computing bill by 72% globally.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare solutions make it easy to launch new solutions, test site changes, and more__ \n\nWith Workers, Edgemesh can deploy new solutions more quickly. After a recent widespread Internet outage, customers were concerned about the dependency of their sites on certain platforms. Loveless recalls, \"We were discussing the value of a tool where people put in their website and see all their third-party network and infrastructure dependencies. One of the devs said, 'I can knock that out. I'll just do a quick Worker site.' And it was ready by the end of the day.\"\n\nArgo Smart Routing also simplifies Edgemesh's deployment processes. \"With Tunnel, we can quickly spin up backend infrastructure in Kubernetes, and Tunnel handles IP allocation and routing,\" LeBeau says. \"Plus, none of our infrastructure has a public IP address. That's both a big security and operational win.\"\n\nEdgemesh also takes advantage of Cloudflare Load Balancing when testing changes to sites. According to Loveless, \"Cloudflare Load Balancing makes Canary deployments very easy. You can just tell the Worker to intercept a production route and randomly send some traffic to hit a different endpoint instead. When combined with Argo tunnels, we can build sophisticated load balancing and traffic sharding solutions in hours. It has made Canary deployments a lot easier because it's all just JavaScript.\"\n\n### __A secure solution for global scalability__\n\nCloudflare solutions enable Edgemesh's software to achieve higher performance and scalability, but Loveless says that is not the only reason they use Cloudflare. \"Cloudflare gives us the security and the scale that we need to deliver software to customers around the globe.\"",

The company's website also provides the option to search for hotels, insurance and car rentals.\n\n123Milhas receives many visitors on a daily basis and also stores a significant amount of confidential information from its customers and the company. Over the last year, the company has  experienced a variety of malicious attacks, including DDoS attacks coming from different countries. The company needed to improve the security of its ecommerce platform, without this choice affecting its performance.\n\n### __Implement an effective security solution__\n\nOne of the major challenges that brought 123Milhas to Cloudflare was the constant malicious attacks it had been receiving, but which were manually defended by a basic system. \"We didn't have a firewall, just traditional security that was configured internally,\" said André Souza, IT manager at 123Milhas.\n\nInstead of putting together a new team to exclusively handle these attacks, 123Milhas' IT team searched the market for a reliable company that would offer all the support needed in this area, improving the performance and security of the servers. \"Now, with Cloudflare, everything is done in an automated and fluid manner, which adds another protective layer where I can observe everything that is happening,\" explained Souza.\n\n### __Security coupled with performance__\n\nOne of 123Milhas' biggest challenges was to have a secure platform that was still fast for whoever accessed it. To that end, the company chose to adopt Cloudflare's Argo Smart Routing Argo solution, which uses Cloudflare's global network intelligence to route inbound and outbound traffic around congestion on the public Internet. This solution reduced latency for 123Milhas' site.\n\nAndré explains how this solution was necessary for the team: \"A reality in our sector is the speed at which we present information to our customers. Every second we gain is worth a lot, and as we are in an area where information changes very quickly, our cache wasn't working properly. After a conversation with the Cloudflare team, this problem was resolved through an email exchange,\" he says.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __FanHero uses Cloudflare Waiting Room to elevate user experience and protect multi-million dollar contracts__\n\nFounded in 2016, FanHero is a white label video platform that allows customers to deliver and monetize content around the world. Whether a customer has on-demand or live video content, FanHero provides an all-in-one solution to host, manage, and distribute video for a variety of industries, including sports, corporate events, educational content, and more. Due to the nature of their product, it is important that FanHero delivers a fast and reliable user experience for their customers so their events can run smoothly for - at times - hundreds of thousands of viewers.\n\n### __Challenge:__\n\nFanHero's service is all about availability and accessibility. Humberto Farias, FanHero's CEO, says, \"We don't have a few minutes to mitigate a problem. If you're watching a live event, and you can't access the platform for as little as a few seconds, it is incredibly frustrating for customers.\"\n\nFanHero sought out Cloudflare because of their unique mix of performance, security, and reliability. According to Farias, \"We were looking for a solution that was a one-stop shop in terms of having everything in one place.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Waiting Room helps FanHero manage sudden surges in viewers__\n\nWhile looking for a platform that met its needs, FanHero learned about Waiting Room. Waiting Room is a Cloudflare solution that provides a virtual queue, controlling the rate at which visitors access a website. \n\nFanHero tries to predict the number of viewers that a particular event will attract, but turnout occasionally catches them by surprise. Farias says,  \"If we are hosting a game that is very popular, and we end up getting hundreds of thousands more users than anticipated, we know that our infrastructure will have time to scale thanks to Waiting Room, and our customers will ultimately have a good experience.\"\n\nEven if FanHero is not surprised by the viewership of an event, sudden surges in traffic can tax the platform. Most viewers will try to sign on right before a game or other event will start, requiring FanHero to suddenly process an influx of payment transactions. While FanHero's systems can handle the surge, their third-party payment partners do not always have the same capacity.\n\nThis can create latency on the platform, which reflects poorly on FanHero. With Waiting Room, FanHero can manage the number of users submitting a payment at one time to ensure that all transactions go through smoothly and no systems are overwhelmed. According to Farias, \"Cloudflare Waiting Room provides that layer of protection to ensure that customers ultimately have a good experience.\"\n\nFanHero has used Waiting Room for dozens of events and has already seen the benefits. A recent event had 375,000 visitors from 50 different countries, and 100,000 of those visitors consumed paid content. Without Waiting Room, the surge in requests right before the event could have created a challenge for FanHero's payment processing vendors. Waiting Room ensured that the infrastructure of FanHero's payment processing vendors had time to autoscale in order to deliver an exceptional experience to the hundreds of thousands of viewers who wanted to watch and enjoy the game, even as their competitors' systems crashed under demand.\n\n\"Waiting Room is fantastic because it allows us to scale while also providing that extra layer of protection to ensure that customers ultimately have a great user experience,\" says Farias. \"They were able to experience the passion and excitement of a live game, even through the limitations of today's remote world.\" \n\n### __Cloudflare Waiting Room ensures a positive viewer experience__\n\nWaiting Room gives FanHero confidence that they can provide a positive experience for viewers and meet contractual obligations. According to Farias, \"Our SLA is not in hours, it's in minutes. Downtime is catastrophic, not just from a reputation standpoint but also from a monetary standpoint. It is even worse from a user experience standpoint. Cloudflare Waiting Room helps us to avoid catastrophe and ensures that we don't lose multi-million dollar contracts.\"",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare supports Bitso's rapid expansion with Zero Trust security and performance optimization__\n\nMexico-based Bitso is the largest cryptocurrency platform in Latin America and the region's first \"crypto unicorn,\" having [secured $250 million in a recent Series C investment round that valued the company at $2.2 billion.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/05/05/mexican-bitcoin-exchange-bitso-raises-250-million-becomes-latin-americas-first-crypto-unicorn/?sh=2304969964af) Over two million customers use Bitso to buy, sell, send, and receive bitcoin and eight other cryptocurrencies. Bitso has a 95% market share in Mexico and over 60% in Argentina. In 2020, Bitso processed more than USD $1.2B of cross-border payments.\n\n### __Challenge: Implement Zero Trust security and optimize performance to support exponential company growth__\n\nCyber security must be paramount for crypto exchanges in order to create a transparent and reliable industry. Bitso started operations in 2014, since then, security has been a fundamental part of the business. Bitso started working with Cloudflare in 2016 and it is now a key component of their operation and security strategy.\n\n\"We understood that, as a nascent company, we wouldn't be able to ensure security at a global scale on our own,\" recalls Mario A Pérez Alejo, Cybersecurity Lead. \"Cloudflare has been a key partner for Bitso since Day 1.\"\n\nBitso initially used Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection, and Content Delivery Network (CDN). As Bitso's product offerings and customer base expanded, the company upgraded to the Cloudflare Business Plan to access more advanced security features and prioritized customer support. \n\nCloudflare Business Plan served Bitso's needs well until 2020, when the company began experiencing exponential growth. It took six years for Bitso to reach one million users, but only 10 more months to reach the next million. In addition to straining its network resources, Bitso's expansion made the company a very attractive target for threat actors and cyber attacks.\n\nAdditionally, during this time Bitso became a fully remote company due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought about another challenge: remote access to services and applications through VPN, which became difficult to configure and manage. Plus, performance was not optimal, and it allowed for lateral movement across data and applications, which represented a risk for data loss.\n\nTo address these concerns, Bitso upgraded to the Cloudflare Enterprise Plan, which offers the most advanced security, performance and reliability solutions on the market. The company also added Cloudflare Access, which uses a Zero Trust model to help teams [secure corporate applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) with better performance and security than a VPN; Argo Smart Routing, which detects real-time network congestion and routes web traffic across the fastest and most reliable network paths; and Cloudflare Rate Limiting, which helps protect against DDoS and other automated cyber attacks.\n\n\"Cloudflare has given us the ability to route, keep and place in sync all our sites. Also, one of the biggest advantages of Cloudflare, is that it allowed us to handle our Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) with terraform, which led us to scale, maintain and ramp up our systems quickly,\"  says Zahid Fernandez Rodriguez, DevOps Engineer at Bitso.\n\n### __Cloudflare Access supports Zero Trust by ensuring the right people have the right level of access to internal resources__\n\nPrior to deploying Cloudflare Access, Bitso's employees used a VPN to connect to internal apps. The VPN was difficult to maintain and had suffered from frequent outages, which limited employee work. Additionally, creating new user accounts took hours, and often more than a day, which further affected efficiency.\n\nIt took Bitso only 10 minutes to deploy and integrate Cloudflare Access with its identity provider (IdP). Bitso can now provide access to internal resources within minutes. \n\n\"Cloudflare Access was a game-changer for Bitso. It made Zero Trust much easier,\" Mario Perez said. \"We now manage access to internal resources more efficiently, ensuring the right people have the right level of access to the right resources, regardless of their location, device or network.\"\n\nBitso operates internationally, with collaborators in more than 30 countries around the world. In addition to enhancing efficiency by eliminating the outages associated with VPN, Access has helped to significantly improve their user provisioning procedures, regardless of geographic location and network of new employees.\n\n### __Cloudflare WAF, DDoS, and Rate Limiting block millions of threats each month__\n\nWhile Bitso is the target of DDoS attacks of different magnitudes and the company often receives malicious requests, Cloudflare has effectively stopped these threats, allowing Bitso to continue servicing its customers without interruption.\n\n\"Cloudflare has been there when cyber attacks happen. Not only to help us block attacks, but also to provide the team with useful analytics that we can use to strengthen our security controls,\" says Emilio Revelo, Security Engineering Manager at Bitso.\n\nNext, Bitso plans to deploy Cloudflare Bot Management, which uses threat intelligence at scale to help organizations [prevent attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) from malicious bots. \"Bad bots are getting more sophisticated, and we need a sophisticated solution to mitigate them,\" adds Mario Perez.\n\n### __Argo ensures fast response times regardless of the customer's geographic location__\n\nWith 70TB of traffic monthly, Bitso's bandwidth resources are constantly being taxed. The cryptocurrency trading market is highly competitive, and cryptocurrency traders are extremely demanding customers.\n\n\"We're dealing with people's money. If our platform is slow, our customers will get very concerned,\" Mario Perez explained. \"In this industry, a good customer experience is key to building trust, and low latency is key for a good experience.\"\n\nAfter deploying Argo Smart Routing and integrating it with the Cloudflare CDN, Bitso saw an immediate improvement of up to 42% in site speed for users in Argentina, a country that's notorious for slow internet. In Mexico, Argo improved speeds by 38%. \n\n\"In the past five months alone, Bitso's traffic has doubled, but Argo Smart Routing ensures fast response times for all of our customers, regardless of their geographic location, even in countries with slow internet speeds,\" Mario Perez said.\n\nMario Perez points to the teamwork between Cloudflare and Bitso as a key element of a successful partnership. \"Our local customer success team in Mexico is phenomenal. They've helped us strengthen our security and optimize performance,\" he said. \"I'm enormously grateful. Bitso has ambitious goals, and our partnership with Cloudflare is essential in achieving them.\"\n",

BridgerPay's platform frees merchants from having to manage multiple payment providers and enables merchants to scale globally by making it simple for them to add payment options that are local to a specific area. Currently, BridgerPay works with approximately 250 merchants worldwide and facilitates over $250 million in transactions monthly.\n\n### __Challenge: Mitigate frequent DDoS attacks and secure remote access to merchant admin portal__\n\nShortly after launching their platform, BridgerPay began experiencing complex DDoS attacks that would slow HTTP requests and strain their resources. As part of the BridgerPay product is embedded within websites, they had to protect themselves as well as their software from any attacks that might also occur on outside websites. Additionally, these attacks were preventing access to BridgerPay's merchant portal, which its customers used to configure and maintain their accounts. BridgerPay also wanted a simpler and more secure way to protect user access to the merchant portal, which was being protected by authentication secrets. \n\nBridgerPay signed up for Cloudflare's performance and security suite, along with Cloudflare Access, which uses a Zero Trust model to help teams [secure corporate applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) with better performance and security than a VPN; Cloudflare Rate Limiting, which helps protect against DDoS and other automated cyber attacks; and Argo Smart Routing, which detects real-time network congestion and routes web traffic across the fastest and most reliable network paths. \n\n### __Cloudflare Access lets BridgerPay secure its merchant portal the easy way__\n\nWhile Access is designed to enable distributed workforces to securely connect to internal resources, BridgerPay easily adapted it for a different use case: ensuring that their merchants could securely access their online admin portal. \n\n\"Access was the perfect solution for securing our merchant portal,\" recalls Yaron Hersh, CTO. \"Within five minutes, we had it completely set up, without having to rewrite code or make any other changes.\"\n\nCloudflare Access adds an authentication page in front of applications an organization doesn't want to be publicly accessible, as well as securing merchant logins with Zero Trust authentication. Access also shields the portal from DDoS and other automated attacks, since the portal is no longer visible on the public internet.\n\n\"Some DDoS attacks were slowing the portal,\" Hersh adds. \"Putting Access in front of it helped prevent DDoS attacks and potential downtime, and it also made merchant logins more secure.\"\n\nCurrently, BridgerPay has about 200 Access seats. The company is planning to expand its usage to protect internal resources for employees, who currently use VPNs.\n\n\"Our VPN clients are constantly under attack. They're also very difficult for our IT team to configure, and for our employees to use,\" Hersh says. \"Access is an easier, faster, and simpler solution for everyone, not to mention more secure.\"\n\nWithout Cloudflare Access, BridgerPay would have had to develop its own internal authentication solution, a process that would take months -- and could come at a severe opportunity cost, since developers wouldn't have time to work on internal projects.\n\n\"Using Access instead of developing our own solution saved us hundreds of work-hours, but the savings goes beyond payroll,\" says Ran Cohen, Co-Founder and CEO. \"We wouldn't be able to grow our client base if we didn't have the time to focus on building new features.\"\n\n\"Access gave us time to work on our business instead of just at it,\" Hersh adds. \"Security isn't a revenue driver, but it's essential to the business. Cloudflare Access enabled us to quickly deploy a secure access solution for our business.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare solutions are sprinkled throughout BridgerPay's infrastructure__\n\nIn addition to Access, BridgerPay uses a number of other Cloudflare products, including Rate Limiting, Argo Smart Routing, and Cloudflare Workers.\n\n\"In addition to stopping DDoS attacks, it's also important to throttle other types of malicious traffic, like automated scrapers,\" Hersh says. \"Rate Limiting throttles many thousands of bad requests every day.\"\n\nAfter enabling Argo Smart Routing, BridgerPay saw a 68% improvement in page load times for customers located in Singapore. Beforehand, users in Singapore had experienced poor performance because they were located far from BridgerPay's data center in Europe.\n\n\"Once we enabled Argo, I haven't heard a single customer complaint about site slowness,\" Hersh says. \"Clients have actually complimented us about improvement in transaction speed.\" \n\nBridgerPay also uses Cloudflare Workers, which provides developers with a serverless execution environment that enables them to create entirely new applications or augment existing apps with custom code at the edge — without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. Currently, BridgerPay uses Workers to inject headers into their customers' checkout pages. These headers perform tasks like IP filtering, so malicious traffic can't access the page.\n\n\"The benefit of using Workers is that if I need to make a change, I just update the Worker, and the merchant doesn't have to do anything,\" Hersh explains.\n\nMoving forward, Hersh would like to expand BridgerPay's use of Workers so that the company can leverage the edge to [improve performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/), especially for compute-intensive tasks.\n\n\"Right now, I use my cloud providers' tools for compute-intensive tasks, but then, they're limited by the cloud provider's region,\" Hersh explains. \"Workers would eliminate that limitation.\"\n\nCohen sees BridgerPay's partnership with Cloudflare as integral to BridgerPay's continued growth. \"Security keeps many CEOs awake at night, but with Cloudflare in place, I sleep soundly. One of the most important things we can offer to our merchants is the confidence that we have the highest levels of security in place. Cloudflare gives us that confidence, and with it, we can continue scaling.\"\n",

Dewaweb's customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to large enterprises, which span both the public and private sectors. Dewaweb is ISO 27001 certified and provides its customers with 24/7 support and a 100% uptime SLA.\n\n### __Challenge: Find a smarter, faster way to mitigate frequent DDoS attacks__\n\nDewaweb had been using an in-house solution to detect DDoS attacks, a process which was very time-consuming and ineffective. The situation reached its peak when Dewaweb began experiencing more frequent DDoS attacks when the COVID-19 pandemic started. Engineers had to spend a lot of time mitigating the attacks and communicating with affected customers, who were upset because their sites were either very slow or taken offline completely. \n\n\"Mitigating the attacks would take hours, sometimes days, which harmed both our internal productivity and our reputation,\" recalls Edy Budiman, CEO. \"We needed a smarter, faster way of mitigating these attacks.\"\n\nAfter evaluating several hardware-based DDoS solutions, Dewaweb chose Cloudflare Magic Transit, a cloud-based solution that uses Cloudflare's global network to protect entire IP subnets from DDoS attacks while also accelerating network traffic.\n\n### __Magic Transit provides always-on, real-time protection against even the largest, most complex DDoS attacks__\n\nShortly after deploying Magic Transit in March 2021, Dewaweb experienced a DDoS attack (400 Mbps), which Magic Transit stopped almost instantly.\n\nMagic Transit has continued to protect Dewaweb since. Three months post deployment, Magic Transit has mitigated 10.22B packets from 2,575 attacks.\n\n![Dewaweb - dash](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2JoWGZufNFNKnhFdOF2n4P/76a8faef2d0cc2db319f379888a1f991/Screen_Shot_2021-06-28_at_9.13.31_AM.png)\n\nBy helping Dewaweb mitigate DDoS attacks that could impact systems availability and reliability, Magic Transit helps the company maintain both its SLA and its ISO 27001 certification. In addition to requiring organizations to dedicate adequate resources to security, ISO 27001 requires that organizations ensure that their systems remain online and available to users.\n\n\"Magic Transit is far more cost-effective than hardware-based DDoS solutions, which require a lot of upfront expense and ongoing costs for power consumption and administrative overhead,\" Edy says.\n\nEdy raves about Magic Transit's simplicity and how quickly it mitigates attacks. \"Magic Transit is plug-and-play. We don't have to spend time maintaining it,\" he says. \"Because it uses Cloudflare's Anycast network to mitigate DDoS attacks at the edge, it stops attacks quickly.\"\n\nMagic Transit also allows Dewaweb's engineers to focus on enhancing the company's existing services and developing new ones instead of monitoring and mitigating attacks. \n\n\"Before Magic Transit, our NOC team had to stand by and be on-call constantly,\" Edy recalls. \"We finally have peace of mind, knowing that our network is continuously protected against any kind of L3/L4 DDoS attacks.\" Better yet, now Dewaweb's team can view DDoS attacks that are automatically blocked by Magic Transit in real-time right from the Cloudflare dashboard.\n\n![Dewaweb - Graph](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1JyP1qpjjvrUEQbxTkpLe4/6aa756c282a9cbc642e75731c5d4606e/Screen_Shot_2021-06-28_at_9.14.59_AM.png)\n\n![Dewaweb - Attack](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7eukajSLwkM6ydLoG7p5P/9bbc2ea2804f8b307c7d93d9b0faa722/Screen_Shot_2021-06-28_at_9.15.49_AM.png)\n\nMany companies in Indonesia — particularly non-technical firms that Dewaweb is helping get online for the first time — are unaware of the threat that DDoS attacks pose and how important it is to protect against them. For this reason, Dewaweb sees their use of Magic Transit as a key selling point. \n\n\"Our partnership with Cloudflare is highly strategic, and is focused on user education and product integration,\" he says. \"We also want to integrate Cloudflare into a new security-as-a-service solution aimed at the enterprise market.\"\n\nDewaweb also wants to expand its use of Cloudflare solutions in-house. \"Dewaweb is a cloud-based company with a distributed workforce. Many of our team members currently work from home because of the pandemic,\" Edy explains. \"Cloudflare's cloud-based tools are a much better fit for us than on-prem solutions.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __ngena uses Cloudflare Magic Transit to protect distributed communications infrastructure as they mature from start-up to scale-up__\n\nBased in Frankfurt, ngena has built a global cloud platform to offer Connectivity-as-a-Service to customers around the world. By using ngena's end-to-end platform for networking, customers don't need to acquire, deploy, and configure hardware to meet their networking needs. Instead, they use ngena's pre-configured and secure SD-WAN solution to simplify their networks and better support their multiple sites and expanding remote workforces.\n\n### __Challenge: Rapid growth drives a need for improved protection__\n\nWithin the last few years, ngena's customer list has grown rapidly. With this success comes additional visibility to cybercriminals. For ngena, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against their systems would impact their ability to provide networking services to their customers. To manage these risks, ngena deployed Cloudflare Magic Transit, which offers DDoS mitigation for network infrastructure as well as optimized traffic routing and [protection against other cyber threats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/).\n\n### __Magic Transit provides distributed protection and optimized routing__\n\nWhen ngena chose to move to Magic Transit, they were pleased by just how easy it was to deploy the solution. \n\n\"It was very smooth. There was great support from Cloudflare,\" says Miroslav Istona, Network Engineer at ngena. \"Someone was always there, picking up the phone, replying to my emails, and solving my problems when I needed them.\" \n\nngena has customers all around the world and has deployed a network of points of presence (PoPs) to support them and increase the resiliency of customer networks. Deploying physical DDoS mitigation appliances at each location is not an option, making an edge-based DDoS protection solution essential.\n\nMagic Transit's DDoS mitigation is deployed at the edge of the Cloudflare network. This allows it to provide distributed protection to all ngena's locations without the cost and complexity associated with stitching together multiple standalone solutions and network hardware. Istona says, \"We have the protection enabled at every location, but we can now see it all in one dashboard. We can see all our locations, the status of them, or if there are any ongoing attacks. If there were issues in the past, we would have to log into each device and check if there was any type of DDoS attack. Now, we can just go to the Cloudflare dashboard and not just see everything at once, but manage and analyze it too. This saves us so much time.\" \n\nFor ngena, Cloudflare's geographic distribution is another major advantage. Once inside the Cloudflare network, traffic is routed to its destination over optimal network paths, providing a significant improvement in network latency. According to Istona, \"In the past, we explained to customers that the problems that they're having were caused by the Internet routing traffic improperly. With Cloudflare and with all their points of presence all over the world, we can be almost 100% sure that the traffic from the Internet will enter Cloudflare and then the ngena networks at the proper place.\" For some of ngena's customers, the use of Cloudflare's network has improved network latency by up to 50%.\n\n### __Building the network of the future__\n\nngena sees Cloudflare as a strategic partner as they continue to work towards their mission to simplify network connectivity for customers around the world. Both companies share the belief that [The Network is the Computer®](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-network-is-the-computer/) and are helping organizations to simplify and optimize their network infrastructure. According to Dr. Marcus Hacke, co-founder and CTO at ngena, \"We are dedicated to providing the highest class of service to our customers. We're proud to use a security vendor like Cloudflare, who's also providing that service\".",

						"shortDescription": "Home Chef leverages Cloudflare Bot Management to protect its website from credential-stuffing bots.",
						"longDescription": "## __Home Chef deploys Cloudflare Bot Management to stop attacks by credential-stuffing bots__\n\nFounded in 2013, Home Chef is a meal-kit delivery service that simplifies meal planning and makes it possible for anyone to cook nutritious, delicious meals. Home Chef currently serves about 220,000 customers across the U.S. every week. In 2020, the company delivered 10 million meals and expanded its delivery territory to include 97% of the US population.\n\n### __Challenge: Mitigate frequent attacks from highly sophisticated credential-stuffing bots__\n\nCloudflare has been a part of Home Chef's tech stack for several years. Home Chef began with the Cloudflare Pro Plan, which includes Cloudflare's base [security and performance solutions](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/), as well as image and mobile optimization, page rules, and cache analytics.\n\n\"From the beginning, Home Chef has relied heavily on Cloudflare to provide a base layer of security for our customers,\" explains Dave Giunta, VP of Engineering. \"We didn't have to pay much attention to security, because Cloudflare handled it all.\"\n\nHowever, around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Home Chef experienced a significant and sudden spike in credential-stuffing bots. This increase coincided with two events: the pandemic had caused Home Chef's business to double nearly overnight, and the company had been affected by a massive onslaught of bot traffic which degraded site performance.\n\nUp until that point, Home Chef had fended off bad bots through firewall rules and block/allow lists, but as the frequency and sophistication of bot attacks grew, they realized they needed an even more advanced bot management tool. \n\n\"This was a different level of bot attack than we'd seen previously, more automated and smarter, utilizing jumping IP addresses and other methods to avoid detection,\" Giunta recalls. With a small team responsible for identifying and mitigating each attack, he estimated that collectively, all incidents cost the company $50,000 in lost productivity.\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management blocks 250,000 threats weekly__\n\nHome Chef needed a solution that could level up their security without degrading site performance or requiring their internal team to expend additional time and resources. After discussing the situation with Cloudflare, the company decided to upgrade to an Enterprise Plan, while also adding Cloudflare Bot Management.\n\n\"We were very happy with the Pro Plan for a long time, so there was no question we'd turn to any vendor other than Cloudflare to solve our problem with bad bots,\" Giunta says.\n\nEach week, Cloudflare Bot Management prevents approximately 250,000 malicious bots from reaching Home Chef's website. After implementing Bot Management and several other infrastructure changes, Home Chef's page load speeds improved by about 10%, even though traffic to the site nearly doubled.\n\n\"I've worked in Software Engineering for 15 years. I've never seen page load times improve as site traffic increased, but Cloudflare Bot Management helped make that happen,\" Giunta says. \"Bot Management's machine learning algorithm learns very quickly, and it catches smart bots that get through our firewall rules.\"\n\nWith Bot Management blocking malicious bots, Giunta's team can now concentrate on supporting end users and working on internal projects that drive the business. \"Before deploying Bot Management, responding to security incidents involving bad bots took up a lot of my team's focus,\" Giunta says.\n\nAdditionally, Home Chef utilizes Cloudflare Logs, a feature for Enterprise customers that enables them to integrate Cloudflare's security and performance data with other analytics providers. This allowed for better visibility into their data and events they did not have before.\n\n\"Connecting Cloudflare with our application logs allows us to determine correlations between our application activity and our Cloudflare activity,\" Giunta explains. \"Among other things, we can see how the Bot Management Bot Scores fit into the rest of our security environment.\"\n\n### __Home Chef plans to expand its partnership with Cloudflare__\n\nMoving forward, Home Chef is examining using Cloudflare Workers, which is Cloudflare's serverless computing platform, to extend the capabilities of Cloudflare Bot Management as well as engage in advanced image processing. \n\n\"As bot traffic grows in frequency and complexity, we're looking at a few options,\" Giunta says. \"We'd like to expose the Bot Score to the rest of our application stack and possibly serve specialized pages to bot traffic. We'd also like to examine more advanced image processing functions that are only possible through running custom code with Workers.\"\n\nGiunta's only regret is that Home Chef didn't expand its partnership with Cloudflare sooner. \"We should have upgraded to the Enterprise plan sooner due to our company's growth. The fact that the Pro Plan worked for us for so long is a testament to the quality of Cloudflare's solutions,\" Giunta says. \"Similar to how Home Chef makes cooking easy, Cloudflare makes security easy. We've never had to hire dedicated security staff, because our IT team could easily configure and manage Cloudflare's solutions.\"\n\nGiunta raves about his experience with Home Chef's Cloudflare representatives. \"While some other vendors push me to buy products Home Chef doesn't need, just to meet their sales quota, Cloudflare always introduces me to solutions that would benefit Home Chef,\" he says. \"Our Cloudflare account team is fantastic. I'm accustomed to dealing with aggressive salespeople. I've never felt that way with Cloudflare.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare supports eTeacher Group towards a Zero Trust security model__\n\nFounded in 2000, Israel-based eTeacher Group uses modern technology to provide virtual learning to over 35,000 students in 200 countries and regions, ranging from small children to adults. With over 850 employees worldwide, eTeacher operates almost on an entirely remote basis. The company currently offers classes in nine different languages and is continually seeking to expand its reach through new course offerings and collaboration with ed-tech professionals.\n\n### __Challenge: Simplify remote access to internal resources while moving towards a Zero Trust security model__\n\nApproximately two weeks prior to Israel officially issuing COVID-19 shutdown mandates, eTeacher Group anticipated having to shift to a remote work model, so they set up VPN access for all of its employees, including its global workforce of call center employees.\n\nHowever, the company found the VPN very difficult to configure — especially for its call center employees, who are distributed worldwide and work from their own devices. Additionally, eTeacher Group wanted to implement a Zero Trust security model to better secure its digital IP and [harden its defenses](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/) against credential stuffing and other cyberattacks that involve weak or stolen passwords. The VPN didn't support this plan. Neither did the company's WAF, which was difficult to configure and didn't provide advanced security analytics.  \n\nAfter a local cybersecurity company suggested that eTeacher's CTO, Boaz Borovsky, contact Cloudflare, the company did a proof of concept (POC) of Cloudflare Access, which helps teams secure corporate applications with a Zero Trust model. \n\nAfter a successful POC of Access, Borovsky integrated Cloudflare Tunnel, a secure tunneling software that establishes a private connection between internal applications and the Cloudflare edge, along with Cloudflare WAF. To ensure high performance and availability as eTeacher's traffic rapidly grew post-pandemic, he also implemented Cloudflare's performance suite.\n\n### __Cloudflare Access & Tunnel enable eTeacher Group to eliminate its VPN__\n\nAfter implementing Cloudflare Access, eTeacher Group reduced its employee onboarding time by 60%. The added efficiency of Access helped all teams get up to speed faster.\n\n\"Configuring VPN access for new employees was time-consuming, extremely difficult, and prone to mistakes,\" Borovsky explains. \"Setting up new employees on Access is simple, and we know it's secure.\"\n\neTeacher's employees appreciate Access' ease of use in contrast to the VPN. \"Cloudflare Access provides a simple, seamless logon experience for non-technical employees like me,\" says Itay Shalital, CFO. \"It's so easy to use, I don't even know it exists! It just works.\"\n\nAccess also made it simpler for eTeacher Group to block public access to certain URLs, such as the company's login link for its content management system (CMS). \"Without Access, restricting access to a CMS login page is difficult and requires special plugins. Meanwhile, CMS login pages are very susceptible to brute-force attacks like credential stuffing,\" Borovsky explains. \"Access made it amazingly easy for us to hide that URL from the public internet.\"\n\nBy integrating Access with Cloudflare Tunnel, eTeacher Group can deploy a private networking model on Cloudflare's edge. For example, sensitive applications they need to keep off of the public Internet are connected to Cloudflare via Cloudflare Tunnel, and Access sits in front of the applications, enforcing multiple complexity based rules about who can log in. \n\n\"We wanted to go a bit 'off-grid' when publishing these particular apps,\" Borovsky recalls. \"Without Tunnel, this wouldn't have been an easy thing to accomplish, but Cloudflare made it easy.\"\n\nTunnel also enabled eTeacher Group to begin the process of closing all inbound communication to the Cloudflare WAF and segue to outbound traffic only. \n\n\"Eventually, we want to use Access and Tunnel to implement a Zero Trust security model company-wide,\" Borovsky explains. \"We want to fully integrate Cloudflare with our cloud services provider and all of our other technical solutions.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare WAF enhances security by providing actionable insights into traffic patterns__\n\nCloudflare WAF has become a critical part of eTeacher Group's security defense, particularly because of the security analytics it provides.\n\n\"Cloudflare WAF's analytics let us see exactly what's going on with our traffic, which gives us insight that we never had before,\" Borovsky says. \"For example, we were able to identify and eliminate DNS problems that we struggled with in the past.\" \n\nThe company also found out it was being targeted by non-existent domain attacks, which Borovsky's team had no way of knowing before. On another occasion, Borovsky's team identified a script that was attempting to learn more about eTeacher Group's certificates. The team used this information to build a custom rule in the WAF to block the script, preventing a potential security incident.\n\n\"With Cloudflare WAF, our company's security is already on a higher level,\" Borovsky says. \"The default rules cover nearly all of our needs. When we do need a custom rule, it's very easy to build, test, and deploy one.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare is helping eTeacher improve performance and implement Zero Trust security__ \n\n[Cloudflare's security solutions](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) are playing a key role in eTeacher Group's journey towards a Zero Trust security model, which Borovsky sees as a necessity in an increasingly digital world and a highly dynamic threat environment.\n\n\"IT is evolving by leaps and bounds, and more sophisticated, more destructive cyber threats are emerging every day,\" Borvosky says. \"Zero Trust is the only viable security model in this environment, and Cloudflare is making it a lot easier for eTeacher Group to get there.\"\n\n\"Cloudflare is helping us achieve Zero Trust while saving us a lot of time,\" says Ehud Ashkenazi, Team Leader. \"Additionally, Access and Tunnel enable us to get rid of our VPN, and the WAF is much easier to manage than our previous firewall.\"\n\nIn addition to continuing to integrate Cloudflare's security solutions organization-wide, Borovsky wants to do more with Cloudflare's performance suite, as well as with Cloudflare Workers, a serverless platform that simplifies running custom code at the network edge. \n\n\"Workers looks amazing, and there are also a lot of caching and speed tools that we want to implement, like Load Balancing,\" Borovsky says. \"The depth of Cloudflare's offerings is incredible, and Cloudflare is adding new features and tools all the time. Clearly, Cloudflare deeply understands the cyber threat environment and the needs of online businesses.\"\n",

Its family of over two dozen brands includes bwin, Ladbrokes, Coral, partypoker, and BETMGM. Each day, Entain's proprietary gaming software, which is developed and maintained fully in-house, handles over 2 million sports bets, 100 million casino spins, and 21 million poker hands.\n\n### __Challenge: Provide customers with world-class performance and top-notch security as Entain scales globally__\n\nAs an online gaming provider with a global customer base, Entain operates in a highly regulated and competitive market and must meet very demanding user expectations and deliver a secure experience to their customers. Its sites and apps must be available 24/7 and have ultra-low latency. Entain must also secure its web assets from cybercriminals seeking to take over customer accounts, scrape content for use on their own competing sites, or steal highly valuable digital intellectual property.\n\nEntain had been using a competing performance and security suite, but the company found this vendor's solutions to be very expensive, as well as extremely complex and difficult to maintain on their own, with limited automation capabilities. The company sought a simpler, more cost-effective, API-driven solution suite that would enable Entain to automate as many tasks as possible, so that their developers could concentrate on internal projects instead of getting bogged down in maintenance.\n\nEntain chose to implement Cloudflare's [performance and security solutions](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/), including the Cloudflare CDN, Load Balancing, and Rate Limiting. Later, Entain implemented Argo Smart Routing, which automatically detects network congestion and routes web traffic over the fastest links available, as well as Cloudflare Spectrum, a reverse proxy product that improves application speed, security, and reliability by extending Cloudflare performance and security tools to all TCP/UDP applications.\n\n### __Cloudflare performance solutions ensure that customers have flawless in-game experiences every time__\n\nUsing Cloudflare CDN, Load Balancing, and Argo Smart Routing, Entain can deliver a first-class user experience to all of its customers worldwide even as the company rapidly expands its products and customer base.\n\n\"When a customer watches a live sports game and wants to bet on certain outcomes on our sports sites and apps, they expect to get all data in nearly real-time to their devices,\" explains Christoph Haas, Director of Entain Sports Technology. \"Cloudflare helps us with the technology to meet our demands as speed in sports is everything!\" \n\nAfter deploying Argo, Entain saw performance improvements across all of its web properties, including a dramatic improvement in Brazil, where customers are located further away from Entain's servers than in other parts of the world.\n\n\"Argo Smart Routing reduced page load times by 53% in Brazil, solving high latency in that region,\" says Patrick Kast, Engineering Manager Leanops. \n\n\"Cloudflare's worldwide reach ensures that we can deliver top-notch performance to our global customer base,\" Haas adds.\n\nCloudflare Load Balancing enables Entain to run all their applications active across multiple data centers which ensures full redundancy, which is needed to run an I-Gaming Business 24/7.\n\n\"Cloudflare provides us with real load balancing functionality, and like the rest of Cloudflare's performance tools, it's much easier to use and manage then our previous solution,\" says Kast.\n\n\"Cloudflare has a more attractive commercial model than our previous vendor, with advanced traffic analytics and more out-of-the-box features,\" Haas adds. \"Cloudflare's solutions are extremely powerful, but they're also very easy to use and gives us the flexibility with their APIs to automate a lot of tasks. We wanted a performance solution that would let us manage everything on our own, and Cloudflare delivered.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare security supports Entain's proactive approach to cyber security__\n\nThe Cloudflare WAF and Rate Limiting stop cybercriminals from scraping content, such as betting odds, from Entain's websites; launching credential-stuffing attacks against customer accounts to steal digital assets, such as customers' registration bonuses; and compromising security and performance.\n\n\"Cloudflare's security suite supports Entain's proactive cyber security approach by blocking millions of threats each month and providing us with security analytics containing actionable threat intelligence,\" Haas says. \"We serve 300+ million requests each day through our APIs, and all of these APIs are behind Cloudflare.\"\n\nCloudflare's API-first tools enable Entain to automate processes without requiring vendor support, which ensures resilient systems and saves Entain money by minimizing administrative overhead and reducing on-call burden.\n\n\"Securing our sites is a 24/7 job,\" Haas says. \"With Cloudflare as a partner, we can sleep at night. We don't have to worry about a website being taken down during busy times.\"\n\nCloudflare Spectrum is another important tool in Entain's cybersecurity arsenal to ensure the security and performance of the company's TCP/ UDP based-games.\n\n\"Cloudflare Spectrum ensures that Entain's poker networks and other newer game offerings, which require TCP/UDP connections, are protected, as well as fast and reliable,\" Haas says.\n\nThe flexibility of the Cloudflare security suite helps Entain prioritize compliance as the company penetrates new markets, and it supports Entain's mergers and acquisitions strategy. \"The gaming industry is arguably even more regulated than banking. In every country we enter, we have to comply with national, regional, and local regulations,\" Haas explains. \"Cloudflare gives us the agility we need to rapidly deploy in new markets while ensuring compliance with all applicable regulations. It's great to have one partner whose solutions we can use in each and every country where we do business.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Font Awesome uses Cloudflare Load Balancing to ensure high-performance icon delivery for customer sites__\n\nFont Awesome creates icons for companies to use in their websites and products. It began as an open-source project in 2012 and evolved into a business in 2015. Today, it is nearly impossible to browse the Internet without seeing icons created or hosted by Font Awesome. It hosts thousands of icons, which have been used on over 100 million websites.\n\n### __Challenge: Scaling infrastructure to meet rapidly growing demand__\n\nFont Awesome is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. It runs a content distribution network (CDN) that provides access to icons for websites and other apps. The popularity of Font Awesome's icons and its clients' sites means that their infrastructure is often under heavy load.\n\nFont Awesome has expanded their feature set over time. In addition to basic icons — which are relatively small, requiring some CSS assets, web font files, and Javascript code — the company now also offers more complex kits, which come with larger and more complex collections of files. As requests for these kits increased, Font Awesome's infrastructure struggled to scale to meet demand. Origin servers became non-responsive, database connectivity was patchy, and websites using Font Awesome's icons became unstable. \n\nThe company tried a couple of different solutions, but they were ineffective. As a result, Font Awesome had to delay product releases because it lacked the infrastructure to support them.\n\n### __Cloudflare Load Balancing eliminates costly infrastructure crashes__\n\nFont Awesome began a trial to see if Cloudflare solutions could solve their issues. Rob Madole, Software Engineer at Font Awesome, was impressed with the results, saying, \"We were able to try everything out from the beginning. So much so that we had Terraform - an infrastructure as code software tool - set up and working before we signed on the dotted line. That was fantastic.\"\n\nAfter partnering with Cloudflare, Font Awesome's stability and scalability issues disappeared. Cloudflare's solutions monitor the health of origin servers and optimally routes traffic to the best match. According to Madole, \"The pressure is gone. I know that, when an origin server goes down, Cloudflare has already worked around it. It is diverting that traffic to a healthy origin, and I could go in there and debug without stress.\"\n\nIn addition to increased resiliency, Cloudflare Load Balancing also provides improved performance. With dynamic traffic steering, Font Awesome doesn't need to plan for deployments in new locations because Cloudflare automatically handles traffic routing. With this optimization, Font Awesome has seen an average 60 ms performance improvement. According to Madole, \"The performance improvement from Cloudflare is a huge benefit for our clients. If you shave 60 ms off your request on a retail site, that equals sales, conversions, and engagement. It's fantastic.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare solutions simplify development and maintenance__\n\nCloudflare's solutions also help Font Awesome's development processes, as managing a large SaaS solution with a small team can be overwhelming. By increasing visibility, automating infrastructure management, and supporting an alternative approach to caching, Cloudflare API, Terraform Provider, and Workers address Font Awesome's development challenges.\n\nThe Cloudflare API gives Font Awesome visibility into its infrastructure and network performance. In the past, Font Awesome often learned of outages from their customers. Now, the company is immediately notified of concerns and can start work on addressing any issues.\n\nThe Terraform Provider Font Awesome tested in the demo has also been a huge help to the company. Previously, origin servers were configured and deployed manually, but with Terraform Provider, Font Awesome is able to automate the configuration of their infrastructure. This makes its origin servers faster and easier to deploy and eliminates the chance for errors.\n\nIn addition to Cloudflare Load Balancing, Font Awesome also uses Workers - which allows serverless applications to be deployed at the edge of Cloudflare's global network - to improve site performance. The company's new GraphQL API previously experienced issues due to high traffic loads. With Workers, Font Awesome is able to implement caching for the API, a feature that would be difficult to implement otherwise due to GraphQL's use of POST requests. With Workers, Font Awesome was able to design and deploy a solution in less than a day that ensured that their API could stay up despite high request volumes.\n\n### __With Cloudflare, Font Awesome can now focus on product development__\n\nFor Font Awesome, Cloudflare Load Balancing is essential to the health of the business. In the past, infrastructure issues hurt the company's reputation and blocked the development pipeline. Now, the company can focus on developing and releasing icon updates and new features.\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare Magic Transit protects RcodeZero DNS against DDoS attacks on a global scale__\n\nBased in Salzburg and Vienna, Austria, nic.at GmbH is the delegating body (registry) for the .at top-level domain (TLD), as well as the .co.at and .or.at domains. Its sister company, ipcom GmbH, also offers domain name services like the Anycast service RcodeZero DNS. In addition to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and global enterprises, more than 20 registries with over 20 million domains already depend on RcodeZero DNS and benefit from reliable DNS protection – now additionally secured with Cloudflare Magic Transit. Maintaining the availability of DNS services for these domains is the company's top priority.\n\n### __Challenge: Global DDoS attacks threaten to take customer domains offline__\n\nIn September 2020, RcodeZero DNS fell victim to a DDoS attack that took both its registered domains and its internal operations offline. \n\n\"The attack hit one of our link server locations, which is behind the same network as our office network,\" explains Klaus Darilion, Head of Operations. \"In addition to taking down customer domains, we couldn't send email or do anything else internally.\"\n\nAt the time, RcodeZero DNS used a DDoS mitigation service offered by their local ISP, to stop the attack against its office network and bring internal operations back online. However, because this service worked only in Europe, it couldn't mitigate the attack on RcodeZero DNS's customer domains; the company had to do that on its own. This required the participation of all operation employees and took about an hour, during which all customer domains were unavailable. While the attack was active, employees were so busy trying to mitigate it that they didn't have time to keep customers informed timely.\n\nTo Darilion and his team, the experience demonstrated that RcodeZero DNS needed a global DDoS mitigation service, especially as it continued to expand worldwide. He decided to implement Cloudflare Magic Transit, which uses Cloudflare's global network to protect entire IP subnets from DDoS attacks while also accelerating network traffic.\n\n### __Magic Transit provides global DDoS mitigation to ensure DNS availability and support RcodeZero DNS's global Anycast DNS cloud.__\n\nAfter deploying Magic Transit on an on-demand basis at the end of 2020, RcodeZero DNS didn't experience another DDoS attack until April 2021. The attack coincided with a very large network maintenance project that impacted Internet services throughout the Vienna area.\n\n\"After two hours of trying to fix the problem with our network, we got hit with a DDoS attack,\" Darilion recalls. \"It was the perfect storm.\"\n\nFortunately, mitigating this attack was just a matter of logging into Magic Transit and turning the service on. Within minutes, Magic Transit stopped the attack.\n\n\"Magic Transit stopped the DDoS attack so quickly, our customers had no idea we'd experienced a problem,\" says Simone Binder, Head of PR and Marketing. \"The attack was stopped before it could cause issues for our customers.\"\n\n\"DDoS mitigation is like insurance. Most of the time, you don't use it, but when you're under attack, you desperately need it,\" Darilion adds. \"Cloudflare provides us with peace of mind, knowing that if we have an attack, Magic Transit will handle it.\"\n\nAdditionally, the RcodeZero DNS sales team has discovered that simply having Cloudflare Magic Transit helps them close sales by providing their customers with peace of mind that their domains will be protected.\n\n\"When I have sales talks, prospective customers always ask us about DDoS mitigation, and when I tell them that we use Magic Transit, they recognize the quality of Cloudflare's services,\" Binder says. \"Magic Transit essentially upgrades our products by giving customers more confidence about using our services.\"\n\n\"In addition to its products, Cloudflare is very well known in the tech community for its deep technical knowledge base. Cloudflare's blog is widely read by system administrators and other IT professionals,\" Darilion adds. \"Our partnership with Cloudflare has a significant positive impact on our other partnerships and our customer relationships.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "ProPublica uses Cloudflare Workers for a webpage caching system that helps guarantee availability and avoids cache stampedes",
						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare ensures that ProPublica's site scales and remains available and performant during sudden traffic surges__\n\n[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org \"ProPublica\") is a non-profit, independent newsroom with a focus on investigative journalism. It has a moral focus targeted at exposing abuse of power and betrayal of public trust.\nTo ensure their website is at its best for its readers, ProPublica has partnered with [Happy Cog](https://www.happycog.com/), a full-service interactive agency. Happy Cog designs, builds, and markets websites, mobile apps, and [ecommerce platforms](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) for organizations around the world.\n\n### __Challenge: High-visibility stories could cause ProPublica's site to experience downtime__\n\nAs a newsroom with a focus on investigative journalism with moral force, ProPublica's stories occasionally capture sudden, national attention. When this occurs, ProPublica's website is flooded with requests from users. Keeping such important stories online and available for readers is critical to ProPublica's mission and goals. \n\nThis sudden increase in traffic can pose challenges for any webpage, but the scale of the challenge increased after ProPublica started to use a new CMS that allowed for a better experience both for members of their production team, and for their designers and developers. However, the resulting webpages — articles — were more complex, meaning that page rendering was more taxing on servers. Although its origin servers have been long situated behind traditional caching systems, huge traffic spikes could tax the site to the point of making it crash. Overall, the team wanted to keep their site dynamic, while still maintaining the performance and stability offered by a static site generator and benefiting from the simplicity offered by their content management system (CMS).\n\nTo avoid such crashes, ProPublica needed to add additional front-end origin capacity, which added complexity and expense. Additionally, cache stampedes could cause cascading failures of pages and servers, resulting in the whole site becoming unavailable.\n\n### __ProPublica and Happy Cog use Cloudflare Workers to build a unique caching system__\n\nIn partnership with Happy Cog, ProPublica developed the 'Baconator,' a new model for serving web content. According to Matt Weinberg, Co-founder and President of Development and Technology at Happy Cog, the model's purpose was  \"Keeping the site up and available. ProPublica was okay with stories being five minutes out of date if it meant that they were always online.\"\n\nTo implement the Baconator, ProPublica and Happy Cog turned to Cloudflare Workers. Workers enables serverless applications to be deployed at the edge of the Cloudflare network, supported by Workers KV, a globally distributed, low latency key value store. According to Weinberg, \"ProPublica was convinced about the flexibility of Cloudflare's edge network because of Workers. It was the perfect fit.\"\n\nIn the Baconator, Workers and Workers KV act as a reverse proxy for ProPublica's primary webserver. When a story is created or updated, a new task is added to a queue. When a Queue Worker processes this task, it requests a copy of the page's HTML from the origin server and stores it in Workers KV. When a reader requests a page, they receive the cached copy from Workers KV. If the age of the cached page exceeds a threshold, the cache is still served, but a background queue item is created to refresh the cached page from the origin.\n\n![Baconator](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6LzX66vLJmsaOfz0YCIEDD/b2a8cd7675b21fc90421ca203c175018/Screen_Shot_2021-05-19_at_6.13.33_PM.png)\n\nThis approach provides a number of benefits to ProPublica. One is that user traffic never touches ProPublica's origin servers, but instead interacts with Cloudflare's high-capacity global edge network. This means high traffic volumes have little impact on [site performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/). Since implementing Workers for caching ProPublica's time-to-first-byte (TTFB) is 50% faster than before. \n\nThe Baconator also supports ProPublica's business continuity plan. With Workers, most of the ProPublica site will remain available even if the newsroom's origin servers are down. According to Weinberg, \"Workers works really well. We cache everything to Workers KV, and if our origin has problems, we could just serve older content from workers KV.\" This also simplifies maintenance and upgrades to the site because ProPublic and Happy Cog can make changes without disrupting availability.\n\nAccording to Frank Sharpe, Product Developer at ProPublica, \"We appreciate the degree of control these tools have given us. Performant and malleable, Workers has improved our platform stability while giving us enormous flexibility.\"\n\nWeinberg is also happy about the visibility and tooling Workers makes available. He says, \"When your caching system is Workers, you get all the tooling that Workers gives you, which means you get access to Wrangler and Wrangler logs. It's much easier to reason about that kind of layer than it is about a lot of other caching systems, which are kind of opaque.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers helps guarantee that ProPublica's site is always up__\n\nFor ProPublica, the accessibility of its website is a primary priority. Using Cloudflare Workers, ProPublica and Happy Cog designed and built a system that promised constant website availability even in the face of sudden traffic surges. According to Sharpe, \"With Workers, we now have the guarantee that our origin would be protected from high traffic volumes. Our readers depend on us, and Workers has been the solidly reliable platform we needed to deliver for them.\" \n",

						"shortDescription": "PropertyGuru uses Cloudflare to greatly reduce malicious bot traffic and minimize latency on image-heavy pages",
						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps PropertyGuru block bad bots, reduce latency and improve rankings__ \n\nLaunched in 2007, PropertyGuru Group is Southeast Asia's leading online property company. Each month, nearly 35 million consumers browse rentals and homes for purchase among PropertyGuru's over 2.8 million listings, which span Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam.\n\n### __Challenge: Deploy a consolidated performance and security solution__\n\nBeing a market leader with the highest coverage of property listings, PropertyGuru is susceptible to being targeted with scraper bots deployed by competitors. In addition to straining PropertyGuru's infrastructure and causing them to incur additional bandwidth costs, these bots hurt the company's reputation, but also adversely impact the home-seeker experience. Competitors would copy the listings but not maintain them, leaving them up long after the property was no longer available. Consumers would see the listings on the competitor's site and contact the listing agent, only to be told the property had been sold or rented some time ago. Since PropertyGuru's name was on the listings, the company was concerned about how this could reflect on them.\n\nPropertyGuru had been using a third-party bot management solution, but they wanted to amplify their ease of use by bringing their bot management and CDN under the same provider. In the market for better bot management, PropertyGuru wanted a replacement that would be easier to maintain and that produced fewer false positives. They also wanted analytical insights their old solution didn't offer. Additionally, the company wanted a web application firewall (WAF), a content delivery network (CDN), and a solution that would enable them to optimize images to fit end users' connection speeds, devices, and browsers. Preferably, they wanted to purchase all of these from the same provider.\n\nAfter evaluating several vendors, PropertyGuru chose to deploy Cloudflare's performance and security platform, including the Cloudflare CDN, WAF, and Bot Management. They also implemented Cloudflare Workers, which provides developers with a serverless execution environment that enables them to create entirely new applications or augment existing apps with custom code, without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management & WAF dramatically decrease threats and provide actionable security insights__\n\nWhile it's critical for PropertyGuru to block malicious bots, like scrapers, it's just as important for the company not to impede legitimate bots, such as Google's site crawlers. After performing a month-long proof of concept of Cloudflare Bot Management, PropertyGuru found Cloudflare's false positive percentage to be very low, and lower than competing solutions. \n\n\"Bot management is tricky. Cybercriminals are good at disguising bad bots to look legitimate,\" explains Kostiantyn Lysenko, Tech Lead, Infrastructure and DevOps. \"Cloudflare's data-driven solution cut our malicious bot traffic in half without blocking good bots.\" \n\nThe PropertyGuru team also found Cloudflare Bot Management to be cost-effective and easy to deploy, with actionable insights and world-class technical support from knowledgeable Cloudflare representatives.\n\n\"Because Cloudflare Bot Management is totally cloud-based, the cost of setting it up was zero compared to our previous solution,\" says Balamurugan Mohandossgandhi, Lead DevOps Engineer. \"The analytics give us valuable insight into our threat environment.\"\n\n\"The Cloudflare interface lets us try out new rules and see how they would work before pushing them live,\" adds Lysenko. \"The documentation is also quite comprehensive, and whenever we need support, we're put in touch with representatives who are very knowledgeable about the product and how to use it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Cloudflare WAF blocks approximately 23 million threats each month from reaching PropertyGuru's Singapore domain, its most highly trafficked site. PropertyGuru has experienced no major cybersecurity incidents since deploying Cloudflare, which gives the team time to work on internal projects that drive the business and enhance security enterprise-wide.\n\n\"The threat landscape changes constantly. The Cloudflare WAF analytics tell us who's attacking us and how, enabling us to harden our systems against new and emerging threats,\" says Pedro Pereira, PropertyGuru's Head of Engineering. \"Thanks to Cloudflare protecting us from zero-day attacks, we have the time to enhance all of our internal security controls. Cloudflare has been invaluable in enabling us to take control of our security.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare's performance solution reduces latency in perennial problem areas and helps PropertyGuru's listings rank higher in Google Search__\n\nPropertyGuru's previous CDN solutions didn't work in all of the countries the company serves, which caused problems with latency in areas where high-speed connections aren't widely available to consumers. Indonesia was a perennial pain point.\n\n\"There were times we had outages because our site couldn't scale quickly enough to meet traffic spikes,\" Pereira recalls.\n\nThe Cloudflare CDN significantly decreased latency on PropertyGuru's Indonesia site, and noticeably improved page speeds even in areas where latency wasn't a big problem, such as Thailand.\n\n\"Cloudflare gave us peace of mind that we wouldn't get a call at 5:00 a.m. saying that one of our sites went down,\" Pereira says.\n\nThese faster page speeds also helped PropertyGuru's listings rank higher in Google Search, where consumers start their property searches. \"Page load speed is a page rank factor for Google,\" Pereira explains. \"Now that our latency is lower, our listings are ranking higher on Google, and more consumers are finding us.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers further improves page load times by enabling PropertyGuru to optimize images__\n\nAs a real estate listings site, PropertyGuru is image-heavy. To prevent high latency, images must be optimized according to the end user's browser, device, and connection speed, while retaining high quality. Prior to deploying Cloudflare, PropertyGuru used an in-house solution to optimize images. However, it was difficult to maintain and extremely inflexible—for example, not allowing images to be resized according to the end user's browser.\n\nUsing Workers, PropertyGuru deploys custom code that runs at the network edge and optimizes images on the fly, according to the user's device size, connection speed, and browser. In addition to improving page load times, Workers enables PropertyGuru to serve high-quality images even to users on very slow connections.\n\n\"Image quality is critical to online property listings,\" Pereira says. \"Cloudflare Workers allows us to capture user requests at the origin and ensure that all users view high-quality images, regardless of their device or connection speed.\"\n\nPropertyGuru plans to expand its partnership with Cloudflare as the company grows. \"Cloudflare offers an excellent suite of performance and security solutions that work very well, are easy to manage, and are backed up by excellent support,\" Pereira notes. \"We wouldn't hesitate to deploy more Cloudflare products as needed.\"",

						"longDescription": "## __Latvia's Ministry of Health smoothly deploys COVID-19 vaccine registration with the help of Project Fair Shot__\n\nIn January 2021, a new Minister of Health took office in Latvia. For the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine rollout, he created a special task force of eight people to manage all components of the initiative for the nation's population of approximately two million. This included appointment scheduling, vaccine distribution logistics, and public relations encouraging people to get the vaccine.\n\nThe country has a phased vaccine rollout plan that defines several groups based upon age, chronic conditions, and job role. As each group becomes eligible, the country will randomly select groups of people to be scheduled for vaccination.\n\n### __Challenge: Small team responsible for national COVID-19 vaccine rollout__\n\nTo support its vaccination approach, Latvia is encouraging all residents to pre-register. This simplifies the process of scheduling appointments when a citizen becomes eligible and provides insights on the demand. This information is valuable for planning the logistics of the rollout and for targeting public relations campaigns to increase interest in vaccination.\n\nPre-registration means that Latvia's citizens can sign up for vaccination at any time. When the registration program launched, the team knew that they would experience a massive surge in requests. Within the first few weeks of pre-registration, 10% of Latvia's citizens had signed up.\n\n### __Ensuring a successful vaccine registration launch__\n\nMāris Dreimanis, Vaccination Project Office IT Coordinator, learned of Project Fair Shot a few weeks before Latvia's registration system was scheduled to launch. The virtual queueing capabilities that it provided were exactly what he needed to protect the registration system's backend infrastructure from the anticipated traffic surge on launch day.\n\nDreimanis and his team created a virtual control room to monitor and manage the launch of the registration system. This room tracked the number of requests received, the requests forwarded to backend servers, and the number and causes of failed requests. They also had the Cloudflare management console open and ready to fine-tune the parameters of the Cloudflare Waiting Room live based upon what they were seeing. This enabled them to increase or decrease the number of people allowed through from the Waiting Room based on the current performance of the backend registration application.\n\nFor the first half-hour, the site experienced extremely high traffic, with few thousands requests per second at its peak. For the following 4.5 hours, an estimated 3,000 requests were received each minute.\n\nThe Waiting Room was key to a smooth launch of Latvia's vaccination system. With Project Fair Shot acting as a gateway, no one lost their place in line, and issues, if any, were invisible to users.\n\n### __Providing a positive experience for all involved__\n\nAccording to Dreimanis, Project Fair Shot was essential to a smooth rollout of Latvia's vaccine registration system. He said, \"Cloudflare Waiting Room allowed us to plan for a steady load instead of having a large investment in the infrastructure for the launch. And it helped with communication because it was considered a good service to the public.\" Dreimanis and his team received extremely positive feedback on how well the launch went.\n\nCloudflare Waiting Room is configurable, allowing messages and updates to be displayed to those waiting in the queue. The team used this forum to explain to people that vaccination is not first come, first served, and that registering on launch day or several days later made no difference. As a result, citizens who saw long lines were comfortable leaving and registering later, providing a better user experience for all involved.\n\nMāris Dreimanis and his team's experience with Project Fair Shot was positive as well. He described it as \"well built\" and \"intuitively understandable.\" He added, \"There's only three parameters you need to play around with. Since you can do it live, that's all you need.\" Without the ability to predict loads or the effects on his systems, a simple, user-friendly interface reduced stress and enabled on-the-fly optimizations.\n\n### __Offering a valuable service for free__\n\nProject Fair Shot is provided as a free service and is available to any organization scheduling COVID-19 vaccinations, regardless of whether they are a Cloudflare customer. Project Fair Shot was Dreimanis' first experience with Cloudflare, and he was extremely happy with how it went, saying, \"I really like that even though we didn't have any contractual engagement, it felt like I had a trustworthy partner to work with.\" He noted they will continue to explore Cloudflare's  product offerings in the future.",

						"longDescription": "## __Verto Health uses Cloudflare Waiting Room to ensure availability and access of COVID-19 vaccine scheduling__\n\nVerto Health is a Canadian-based digital health company working to eliminate the silos of patient data that exist within the healthcare ecosystem. Its Digital Twin technology is designed to organize patients' healthcare data around care journeys and the patients themselves, as opposed to provider environments. This technology ensures that healthcare providers have the best possible information when treating a patient.\n\n### __Challenge__\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Verto Health's customers requested their help in managing COVID-19 testing and vaccine appointments. Their patient-centered platform is ideal for tracking the patient journey through a multi-stage process, such as undergoing a COVID-19 test before travel or scheduling multiple vaccine appointments.\n\nCurrently, Verto Health serves 10% of Canada's population and 20% of Ontario's. This means that even if a small percentage of their customers attempted to sign up for a test or an appointment, they could easily overload the system. To maintain customer trust, Verto Health needed a platform that was both highly available and secure.\n\n### __Waiting Room ensures COVID-19 vaccine scheduling availability and security__\n\nVerto Health had previous experience working with Cloudflare. According to Yousaf Cheema, CISO at Verto Health, \"We used the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall, and it was a simple but effective interface, and it was highly available. Once we turned it on, we were able to trust it to run smoothly without interference.\"\n\nWhen Verto Health was moving into the COVID-19 vaccination scheduling space, their team  read about Project Fair Shot, a new Cloudflare initiative. Project Fair Shot provides free access to Cloudflare Waiting Room for organizations providing COVID-19 vaccination registration. The ability to put visitors into a queue provided the protection that Verto Health needed for its backend infrastructure. Cloudflare Waiting Room also provided much-needed flexibility and deployment speed. Cheema says, \"We wanted a flexible solution because most of our clients will sign a contract and go live within two days. Cloudflare Waiting Room was able to provide us with that speed.\"\n\nCOVID-19 testing and vaccination scheduling creates sudden surges in traffic to Verto Heath's site. According to Cheema, \"A lot of our clients are tweeting that there's a number of vaccination slots available. They have a certain demand and supply of vaccines and they want to make sure they maximize that as well, so there's less waste. That would cause huge surges. We wanted to make sure that we wouldn't go down.\"\n\nIn one month, Verto Health's sites saw over 66 million requests and 1 million unique visitors. Cloudflare Waiting Room gave Verto Health the ability to manage the increased load. \"It gave us so much flexibility during those stressful times when we saw the Waiting Room going for like an hour, two hours, because we were getting a significant surge in traffic. We were able to keep that on while we bumped up our infrastructure,\" Cheema says. \"Cloudflare Waiting Room gave us the time to not be fire fighting but focus on fine-tuning and optimizing instead.\"\n\n### __Verto Health looks toward the future__\n\nAt first, Verto Health used a couple of Waiting Rooms to support COVID-19 vaccination scheduling sites. Now, it is a critical part of their ability to serve healthcare organizations and their patients. According to Michael Millar, CEO at Verto Health, \"Our relationship with Cloudflare went from 'Let's try Waiting Room' to 'Unless you have this, we're not going live with that public facing site.' Our solution is all about patient relationship management, so, as we expand with hospitals, it is going to be part of our default recommendation to them and how they deal with their security stance for opening up their surfaces to the community.\"",

						"shortDescription": "Thanks to Cloudflare Workers and Pages, Dig has a fast, reliable, and secure ordering portal.",
						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare provides Dig with a fast and secure online ordering portal that rapidly scales during peak periods__\n\nDig, also known as Dig Inn, is a large chain of fast casual restaurants focusing on cooked-to-order, plant-based foods, sustainability, and working directly with farmers and partners to plan mindful recipes. It has nearly 50 locations, most of them in urban business districts, and serves six million customers each year.\n\n### __Challenge: Develop a reliable and scalable online ordering site for a restaurant chain__\n\nDig did a significant amount of business online even prior to COVID-19. After the pandemic began, online ordering spiked further. To ensure they had the scalability to meet this increased demand, Dig asked [Happy Cog](https://www.happycog.com/?atrkid=V3ADWAD8940F4_105383721308_kwd-313621176205__421246539061_g_c___&gclid=CjwKCAiAyc2BBhAaEiwA44-wWyyRZPdF9QxyJ1jHX-qplKdmQnxa_0eSXEW0qCEzWf3n5ZuDrA0RCxoCM3kQAvD_BwE), a full-service interactive agency and its long-time partner, to develop two new websites. One would contain an online ordering portal for customers, and the other would be an informational site where customers could learn more about Dig. \n\nBoth websites needed to be secure, fast, and easy for Dig's customers to use. The ordering site needed to seamlessly scale during peak times, when traffic increases rapidly. \n\n\"Uptime is a big priority for Dig,\" explains Matt Weinberg, President of Technology at Happy Cog. \"During the lunch and dinner rushes, Dig's restaurants are incredibly busy. Because restaurant profit margins are razor-thin, even five minutes of downtime during lunch can have a material impact.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers and Pages keep Dig's website up, and its customers digging in__\n\nHappy Cog decided to build Dig's websites using Cloudflare Pages, which allows developers to deploy and host their sites directly to the edge, closer to end users. Pages is a Jamstack-compatible platform that further simplifies the developer experience with full Git-integration, advanced collaboration with unlimited free seats for collaborators, automatic previews for every PR and commit, and more.\n\n\"Cloudflare Pages is very cost-effective, and it's very easy to deploy code,\" Weinberg explains. \"Additionally, Pages offers additional value through integration with Cloudflare's performance and security tools, such as the CDN and WAF, making it the perfect solution for this.\"\n\nDig's [online ordering site](https://order.diginn.com/) is a headless React application that is entirely hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Javascript calls an underlying API to get and handle dynamic ordering logic. The developers at Happy Cog use Github Actions to build/deploy this to Cloudflare Pages when commits are approved and merged to master. \n\nWorkers ensures that React routing happens properly. \"Because this all runs on Workers, we never have to worry about a large spike in traffic or orders bringing down the system and causing a revenue loss,\" Weinberg notes.\n\nThe [informational site](https://www.diginn.com/), meanwhile, is a content management system (CMS) based site integrated with the Cloudflare Cache Break API. While the assets are stored on S3, they also go through Cloudflare to take advantage of Cloudflare CDN caching and Cloudflare Polish image compression. \n\n\"We always recommend Polish to clients. We think it's amazing,\" Weinberg says. \"We also use full-page caching. We built an integration in the CMS so that when they make an API call to effect a change, Cloudflare clears the cache quickly, and the site stays updated.\"\n\nIn addition, both the informational site and the ordering site are protected by the Cloudflare WAF, which blocks thousands of threats each month.\n\nNow that Happy Cog has begun using Cloudflare Pages, he and his team appreciate the automatic preview URLs generated with every PR and commit, making it easy to gather feedback and iterate quickly. \"There are many internal stakeholders at Dig, and many of them are non-technical staff, like culinary specialists,\" Weinberg explains. \"The automatic preview URLs make it easy for us to send preview links to non-technical stakeholders who are part of the decision-making process for new features.\"\n\nSince Dig's websites went live, Happy Cog has saved hundreds of hours annually by eliminating debugging from the server infrastructure. \"In addition to saving us time, if my team doesn't have to debug, that means the customer's sites are running properly,\" Weinberg says. \n\nDig is thrilled with their new websites. \"Our new sites are very fast, and we haven't had one moment of downtime since they launched,\" says Danielle Cranmer, Digital Product Manager at Dig. \"They've performed well even during our busiest times.\"\n\nWeinberg feels that Cloudflare Workers and Pages lends very well to building web solutions for the restaurant industry. \"Restaurants' core focus is making and serving food. They want to concentrate on making good food for their customers, not on their web servers, website, and other technical issues,\" he says. \"They just want to make it as easy as possible for their customers to order food online. Cloudflare Workers and Pages lets us build fast, reliable sites that are very easy for restaurant customers to use.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Umbraco uses Cloudflare to expand functionality and improve performance for customer sites hosted on Umbraco Cloud.",
						"longDescription": "## __Umbraco uses Cloudflare Workers and performance tools to optimize their CMS platform__\n\nUmbraco is the world's largest content management platform based on the .Net stack and currently hosts websites accounting for more than 10,000 domains on its cloud platform. Umbraco's content management system (CMS) has a passionate following among developers, with over 220,000 community members actively engaged in the Umbraco developer community. For this company, highly-performant and secure websites are essential to customer satisfaction.\n\n### __Challenge: Pivoting from open-source to a cloud-based hosted service__\n\nUmbraco has existed as an open source CMS for more than 16 years. As Umbraco gained more success with the CMS, they also added a cloud-based Umbraco service. With Umbraco Cloud, Umbraco is able to deliver a complete end-to-end service and experience using Umbraco as well as adding additional SaaS features to the existing CMS. Today Umbraco Cloud provides numerous developer-centric offerings such as a headless CMS, a complete deployment workflow and also more end-user focused features.\n\nWhen Umbraco launched Umbraco Cloud, it needed to consider the infrastructure requirements of a hosted solution. Customer satisfaction depended on fast site load times, so the company needed a high-performance solution to support its customers' pages. Additionally, Umbraco Cloud offers API-based access for their headless offering. Umbraco wanted the ability to implement rate-limiting for the headless API requests and to protect against malicious bots — They also wanted to provide a unified point of entry for customers hosting multiple different sites on the Umbraco Cloud platform.\n\nAs Umbraco Cloud continued to mature they've opted to switch to Cloudflare to meet these needs because of its focus on both website performance and security. Cloudflare's broad solution portfolio enabled Umbraco to offer value-added services like DDoS protection and HTTPS by default to its customers. This partnership also allowed Umbraco to hand over responsibility for certain core functionality to Cloudflare, enabling Umbraco to focus on delivering a great developer experience on the cloud platform and expanding their hosting offering with new features as the relationship continues to grow.\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers supports site customization for Umbraco customers__\n\nCloudflare enables Umbraco to offer a simpler, more streamlined experience for developers. A developer using Umbraco Cloud has a single username and password, even if they manage multiple different sites. This is possible thanks to Workers, the serverless computing platform that operates on Cloudflare's global edge network. Behind the scenes, Workers enables Umbraco to handle different authentication scenarios without exposing the complexities to their users, and at the same time reap the benefits of Workers being at the edge close to the end-user.\n\nAccording to Morten Christensen, Platform Team Lead, \"With Cloudflare Workers we were able to change the constraints that would normally have been imposed by our Azure infrastructure, and thus implement the deployment flow exactly as we wanted it on Umbraco Cloud. And, of course, the fact that it's at the edge is also a huge benefit. We don't want it to be something that imposes longer wait times since it will be a part of all incoming requests.\"\n\nUmbraco also makes use of Cloudflare Workers to provide a unique and customizable experience to their customers. These serverless applications are applied to a variety of different uses, ranging from image processing to request management.\n\nFor example, Umbraco Cloud is hosted on Microsoft Azure and uses multiple instances of Azure Blob Storage to store images related to its hosted sites. When an image request comes in, Workers determines which Blob Storage instance to retrieve it from based on the request parameters. Before passing the image on to the user, Workers also performs image manipulation, including resizing, cropping, and scaling.\n\nIn addition, Umbraco uses Workers KV, a global, low-latency key-value data store, to hold feature flags for each of its sites based on its headless offering. This enables Workers to determine if a particular site supports GraphQL and other functionality. In the future, Umbraco plans to expand this functionality to let developers customize the caching and security settings for their sites on a per-hostname basis.\n\nAccording to Umbraco, Cloudflare Workers enables them to do things that would not otherwise be possible. Morten Christensen says, \"We can attach a Worker to a specific route for our hostnames, and I think that's something that's pretty unique to Cloudflare.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Improves Performance for Hosted Sites__\n\nAs a hosted CMS, high performance for sites located on Umbraco Cloud is an important driver of customer satisfaction. Cloudflare helps Umbraco to exceed customer expectations.\n\nArgo Smart Routing produced measurable improvements in page load times as well. By finding the fastest network paths for traffic to and from origin servers, Argo produced a 43% improvement in network latency for sites hosted on Umbraco Cloud. \n\nWith Cloudflare, Umbraco is able to provide a single point of entry to its infrastructure and have all traffic intelligently routed to the appropriate web app. The use of Cloudflare's DNS infrastructure also provides increased resiliency and enables Umbraco to add further improvements in this area. \n\nUmbraco also takes advantage of Cloudflare SSL for SaaS offering to generate certificates and configure SSL for its customers' sites. Previously, Umbraco used a custom solution to create and renew Let's Encrypt certificates for each of its customer sites. Now, all of this is handled automatically by Cloudflare.\n\n### __Developing a Positive Customer Experience__\n\nBy providing many of the backend features that Umbraco Cloud requires, Cloudflare provides an improved customer experience and enables Umbraco to focus on developing a world-class cloud platform and CMS.\n\nJacob Mitgaard-Olesen, CTO at Umbraco, sums up Umbraco's experience with Cloudflare, \"Cloudflare offers a wide range of features and services that fit well with what we want to provide with Umbraco Cloud. It benefits Umbraco as a company as well as all our Umbraco Cloud customers because it is secure and fast.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Ticket Tailor partners with Cloudflare to provide a smooth COVID-19 vaccine registration experience__\n\n[Ticket Tailor](https://www.tickettailor.com) was founded in 2010 to support event organizers. Ticket Tailor is designed to provide a software-like experience for ticket sales, where the event organizer largely configures and manages their own ticket sales. This keeps the focus on the event organizer rather than the ticketing platform.Ticket Tailor primarily operates in the UK and the US. However, it has a presence in approximately 180 countries, selling tickets to festivals, concerts, TED Talks, and similar events. \n\nIn 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a change in direction, and, among other things, Ticket Tailor is currently supporting COVID-19 vaccination registration for two United States hospitals.\n\n### __Challenge: Massive interest in COVID-19 vaccines overwhelms Ticket Tailor's infrastructure__\n\nTicket Tailor specializes in selling tickets for in-person events but shifted gears because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout 2020, the company pivoted to support events that suddenly needed the ability to register and schedule visitors in advance, such as museums, food pickups, and farm tours.\n\nTicket Tailor is currently offering [free support to organizations scheduling COVID-19 vaccination appointments](https://www.tickettailor.com/vaccine-registration-software/). However, the high traffic volumes that are associated with these events can overwhelm the company's systems. Cloudflare Waiting Room — available via Project Fair Shot — allows the company to implement an online queue for access to their COVID-19 vaccine registration sites.\n\n### __Cloudflare Waiting Room provides scalability for vaccine registrations__\n\nTicket Tailor is accustomed to traffic spikes with registration for big events, but its backend database can still struggle under the load. According to Jake Gissing, a developer at Ticket Tailor, \"There'll be a huge rush of traffic that we struggle to handle without scaling up our infrastructure.\"\n\nWhen the company started supporting COVID-19 vaccine registration, the traffic strained its infrastructure, a problem that Cloudflare Waiting Room helped to resolve. According to Gissing, \"Typically, we'll hit about 70% utilization across our web servers and database. Without the queue, that initial spike can last anywhere between one and 20 minutes. With Cloudflare Waiting Room's queue enabled, we were letting 200 visitors through at a time, and we saw there's no noticeable spike. It was at 10% of capacity. There are no spikes at all, which is really good to see.\"\n\nGissing also commented that Cloudflare Waiting Room was easy to configure and manage. \"Setting up the first queue took about five minutes,\" he said. \"And the mechanism where it refreshes itself works perfectly well for us.\"\n\n### __Lower traffic volumes reduce stress and costs for Ticket Tailor__\n\nOn the first day of vaccine registration with Cloudflare Waiting Room in place, Ticket Tailor saw about 3,000 visitors looking for 800 vaccine slots. The ability to monitor and configure Cloudflare Waiting Room live was invaluable to the team. \"Once I was able to see how much Waiting Room was allowing us to handle, I did tweak it a little bit to allow more people through,\" according to Gissing. \n\nHaving Waiting Room in place was also a cost-saving measure for Ticket Tailor. Jonny White, founder and CEO of Ticket Tailor, said, \"If we knew a vaccination event was going to be opened up, we'd have two people on standby watching the database and taking time out of their day to do that. Whereas with Cloudflare Waiting Room, we can be confident, and the system doesn't require that.\"\n\n### __A perfect solution to Ticket Tailor's needs__\n\nWhile Cloudflare Waiting Room is currently being used only for COVID-19 vaccination registration via Project Fair Shot, this will not always be the case. Ticket Tailor is looking forward to when it can use the product across its wider customer base for various events. White says, \"We will probably use it for everything in the future.\"",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare protects OVO from nearly 31 million attacks each month and scales the platform to support 150+ million users.",
						"longDescription": "## __OVO partners with Cloudflare to scale and secure Indonesia's largest digital wallet__\n\nOVO is a digital wallet and financial services app serving the general population and underbanked in Indonesia. Its goal is to provide financial services to everyone in Indonesia, especially those without access to traditional banking.\n\nSince its founding in 2017, OVO has grown very quickly. OVO is now accepted as a payment platform by about 1 million merchants across 426 cities. The app is installed on 115 million devices, nearly half of Indonesia's population of 270 million. \n\n### __Challenge: Scaling and securing a rapidly growing company__\n\nFrom the beginning, OVO knew it would need to scale its services to meet demand while protecting itself against cyberattacks. In 2019, after evaluating various security and performance providers, OVO partnered with Cloudflare. The company uses Cloudflare solutions, such as Argo Smart Routing, to improve the performance and scalability of its mobile app. Cloudflare's DDoS protection and WAF protect against near-constant attacks, and Cloudflare Workers supports OVO's business continuity and digital transformation efforts.\n\nWhen choosing a vendor, regulatory compliance was a major consideration. Indonesia has strict data protection laws, and OVO needed a provider that had infrastructure local to the country. Cloudflare has a data center in Jakarta, making it a perfect fit for OVO. \n\n### __Cloudflare protects OVO against continuous attacks__\n\nOVO is the leading digital wallet provider in Indonesia, which makes it a major target for DDoS and other attacks. In an average month, Cloudflare blocks nearly 31 million attempted attacks against OVO's data centers. This includes blocking the IP addresses of computers participating in DDoS attacks as well as blocking more sophisticated attacks.\n\nThis protection against DDoS attacks is essential to the company's success. App users rely upon their systems to be functional and available to make payments. According to Jay Chin, Head of Engineering at OVO, \"We have two data centers right now. So just having a sudden influx of traffic could bring us down. But with Cloudflare, we've never experienced any downtime from DDoS attacks.\"\n\nOVO also found Cloudflare's security products to be extremely easy to use. When working through a security best practices guide provided by Cloudflare, Chin was impressed at how easy Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) is to configure. \"The WAF is very intuitive. So that made it easy to implement all the rules.\"\n\n### __Argo Smart Routing improves OVO mobile app performance by 50%__\n\nAs a payment service, the performance of the OVO mobile app is of paramount importance. OVO uses Cloudflare Argo Smart Routing to optimally route traffic between its app, website, and data centers.\n\nBy using Cloudflare, OVO has dramatically decreased page load time and bandwidth requirements. Argo Smart Routing routes traffic through Cloudflare's overlay network, which monitors the performance of the underlying network and selects the optimal route for traffic.  As a result, OVO pages that are loaded with Argo have an average load time of 369 milliseconds, compared to an average of 829 milliseconds for pages not using Argo, an improvement of over 50%.  The company also saw an immediate reduction in request latency  after enabling Argo, as measured by time to first byte (TTFB) of 28%.\n\nCloudflare also reduces OVO's bandwidth requirements by over 55%, resulting in huge cost savings. According to Jay Chin, \"That means a lot to us, because we have to pay providers for the connectivity to the Internet. And  each time we have a link to the Internet we also have to build in redundant links and VPNs resulting in extra cost..\" By limiting the amount of traffic that reaches OVO's servers, Cloudflare helps the company grow while keeping costs low.\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers addresses challenges at the network edge__\n\nCloudflare Workers is designed to help organizations develop serverless applications that operate at the network edge. OVO uses Workers for business continuity and to support its digital transformation efforts.\n\nAmong others, OVO has deployed Workers to act as a failsafe in the event of a data center outage. If a data center becomes unavailable, Workers will send back an error message to the app, explaining the situation to the user and preventing the app from crashing. \n\nWorkers also supports OVO's digital transformation efforts. The company is in the process of transitioning its infrastructure from on-premise data centers to the cloud. Workers examines incoming requests and depending on the target application, routes traffic to the data center or the cloud as needed.\n\nAccording to Jay Chin, OVO could not have solved these problems without Workers. \"Workers allows us to do things at the edge. We couldn't have this done at our data center, because what if it goes down? And in our migration to the cloud, you don't want to rely on the data center — you want something at the edge.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Spectrum supported rapid transition to remote work__\n\nLike many organizations, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, OVO was forced to rapidly transition from working in the office to working remotely. During this transition, ensuring the availability and security of the corporate VPN was essential.\n\nJay was concerned that if the corporate VPN was exposed to the Internet, it would be the target of DDoS attacks. He decided to deploy Cloudflare Spectrum to protect the VPN and provide load balancing for the company's VPN infrastructure. This ensured the availability and reliability of the company's VPN infrastructure for remote workers in a safe and reliable manner.\n\n### __OVO continues to grow and expand with Cloudflare__\n\nOVO has grown rapidly over the last few years, and Cloudflare has supported it throughout.  Jay says that OVO is constantly looking to improve the performance and security of its systems. He says, \"We'll do a security review and ask are there more things that we need to add on? Or are there any new Cloudflare products that we need to put in to ensure that we have better security? It's an ongoing process that we have.\" \n\nScaling up, staying secure, and complying with Indonesia's stringent data protection regulations can be challenging, but Cloudflare provides OVO with the security and support that it needs to do so.\n\nJay adds, \"Our app has been downloaded on over 115 million devices, and for the majority of our users, OVO is their only banking system. We rely on Cloudflare to keep us up, running, and secure so we can protect our customers and keep their lives moving.\"\n",

Parents and students in the community visited frequently in search of information about the district's remote learning plan. The district's existing web infrastructure was unable to keep up with this increased demand.\n\nMPISD also had experienced problems securing its public websites. Its existing web application firewall (WAF) was unable to both allow its web applications to work and protect them against attacks. SSL certificates for the school's 60 public-facing websites were managed manually.\n\nIn addition, the district used its internet service provider (ISP) to manage the DNS entries for its 60 external-facing websites. This meant the district relied on the ISP for visibility into most of its network traffic. And, since the ISP relied on another third-party provider for some of this functionality, gaining visibility into a potential security incident could take 24-48 hours, which was far too long.\n\n### __Achieving complete network visibility with Cloudflare__\n\nNoe Arzate initially sought out Cloudflare because using Cloudflare's infrastructure would allow him to manage his external DNS entries himself and achieve the required level of visibility into the district's network traffic. He was very impressed with the process, saying, \"It is really nice to be able to, just with the flip of a switch, click on a couple settings, and all the traffic is being proxied through Cloudflare. That is a big plus, because we did not have that visibility.\"\n\nAfter working with Cloudflare, he wished that the district had been able to make the switch earlier. A few months earlier, his team was experiencing issues where its web application firewall was blocking API calls for a SaaS solution used by the district. With the limited visibility that they had into their network traffic, it took a while to diagnose and correct the issue. He is far less concerned about similar issues occurring in the future, saying, \"Now we can see all that traffic that's traversing through our domains. So we can see if there is a problem.\"\n\nAs traffic surged during the pandemic, MPISD switched to using WP Engine for its web hosting. After making the switch, the team was happy to learn that WP Engine uses Cloudflare and that it is available as part of the bundled service package. By combining WP Engine and Cloudflare, the district had access to analytics and metrics that were not previously available. Arzate says, \"I can see the improvements after moving into WP Engine, and, now that we have Cloudflare in front of it, I can see the things that we need to concentrate on to improve on the performance of the website.\"\n\nThe switch to Cloudflare also simplified management of the district's web applications. In the past, the district's IT team manually created and renewed SSL certificates for its applications. Now, all of this is handled automatically by Cloudflare. According to Arzate, \"I can just tell Cloudflare, 'this is the SSL certificate authority that we use.' Cloudflare picks it up from there, and they take care of the deployment of the certificates. Which is great because I don't have to worry about it anymore. It's just a one-time thing.\" By automating the certificate management process, Cloudflare eliminates the worry that a misconfigured or expired certificate will break a critical application and provides significant time savings.\n\n### __Securing web resources with Cloudflare WAF__\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the accessibility and security of online learning resources is critical to the district. When its existing WAF didn't meet MPISD's needs, it chose to switch to Cloudflare WAF.\n\nWhen asked if there were any surprises about the deployment process, Arzate said that there were but in a good way. \"One of the things that was surprising is how easy it was. Many solutions require three, maybe four days just tweaking the web application firewall. That was not the case with Cloudflare. We proxied the traffic, flipped a couple switches, and that was it.\"\nIn the end, he said that it took about 20 minutes to set up only because he wanted a complete understanding of how the system worked and how it was configured. That way, he could more effectively investigate potential issues and explain any problems clearly to the support team.\n\n### __Pursuing the state of the art__\n\nWhile MPISD partnered with Cloudflare after the COVID-19 pandemic began, it has already seen dramatic improvements in its network performance, visibility, and security. According to Arzate, \"The experience with Cloudflare. If I could just give it a rating from one to 10, I will give it a 10. It's been great. It's been simple. It's been easy. And it's not just a product, it has to do a lot with the people that you work with.\" \n\nRather than simply asking peers what they are using, Arzate is a huge proponent of seeing what tools are available in other industries and investigating how they can be applied in education. His advice to CTOs in education: \"We forget the technology that's available to Fortune 100 companies, it's also available to us. We just have to know who to talk to and how to communicate with those people and then figure out a way to bring that technology to our school districts. At the end of the day, once we have that in place and you have the right people in place, it just becomes a better experience for the end users.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare helped LendingTree save over $250,000 in just 5 months and reduced Bot attacks by over 70%",
						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare's security, performance, and serverless solutions provide LendingTree with security at the speed of business__\n\nLendingTree is an online marketplace that enables consumer and business borrowers to connect with multiple lenders to find optimal terms for mortgages, student loans, business loans, credit cards, deposit accounts, and insurance. LendingTree is partnered with over 400 financial institutions worldwide. Over 15 million active users use LendingTree to monitor their credit, shop for loans, and manage their financial health.\n\n### __Challenge: Replace a very expensive security solution that blocked a lot of legitimate traffic__\n\nWhen John Turner, Application Security Lead, joined the team at LendingTree, the company was experiencing multiple cost and performance issues with its security vendor. The vendor's DDoS protection was metered, which caused LendingTree to incur massive overage costs. The solution also blocked legitimate traffic.\n\n\"Their solution wasn't intelligent; it was static,\" Turner explains. \"We had to manually specify arbitrary limits on requests per minute. Once we exceeded that number, the vendor would offload that traffic, handle it for us, and bill us for the overages.\"\n\nThese limitations caused significant issues whenever LendingTree launched a marketing campaign. \"Whenever we ran a new TV spot or a new social media campaign, requests would spike beyond the arbitrary limit that our vendor had us specify, which meant the vendor would interpret the spike as a DDoS attack and block legitimate traffic,\" Turner recalls. \"Not only did we lose those potential customers, but we also lost the money that we spent to get them to our site, and our vendor would bill us for the 'DDoS protection'.\"\n\nTurner turned to Cloudflare because of his previous experience working with the company. \"In my consulting work, I've recommended Cloudflare to clients many times. I knew that Cloudflare's products worked well and offered a good value,\" he says. At LendingTree, Turner decided to implement Cloudflare's performance and security suites, including Bot Management, WAF, and DDoS protection, along with Workers, Cloudflare's serverless platform.\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management stops malicious bots from abusing LendingTree's APIs__\n\nCloudflare's DDoS mitigation is unmetered and offers 51 Tbps of mitigation capacity, so LendingTree doesn't have to worry about setting arbitrary traffic limits. LendingTree has also gotten many other security benefits from Cloudflare, including bot management.\n\nMalicious bots that were abusing LendingTree's APIs were costing the company a lot of money, not only in terms of bandwidth costs but also opportunity cost. Due to the sophistication of the bots and the fact that they were scraping financial data, Turner believed that some of them were being deployed by competitors. LendingTree couldn't restrict the APIs completely, as its partners needed to be able to access them for current rate information. \n\n\"Our bill for a particular API service went from $10,000 a month to $75,000 practically overnight. The next month, it rose to $150,000,\" Turner explains. \"My team had to spend a lot of time investigating these attacks and writing custom rules in an attempt to stop them. Because the attackers were constantly adjusting their tactics, the rules we wrote would only be partially effective for only a short amount of time.\"\n\nCloudflare Bot Management gave LendingTree immediate results. \"Within 48 hours of enabling Cloudflare Bot Management, attacks against a particular API endpoint dropped by 70%,\" Turner reports. \n\nUnlike the solutions LendingTree used previously, Cloudflare Bot Management doesn't impede legitimate automated traffic. \"Out of hundreds of thousands of requests, we found only one instance where a legitimate request was marked as malicious,\" Turner says. \n\nTurner also received confirmation that at least one competitor had, indeed, been abusing LendingTree's API. \"As soon as we stopped the API abuse, one particular competitor's rates immediately rose,\" he recalls. \"Then, I saw a news article remarking that, suddenly, everyone except for LendingTree was quoting high mortgage rates. We strongly suspect that our competitors were scraping our API and using our own data to undercut us.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers enables LendingTree to conduct A/B testing and route traffic at the network edge__\n\nTurner says he utilizes the Cloudflare Workers serverless platform to solve coding problems quickly at the network edge. \"Workers is my Swiss Army Knife. I have multiple use cases for it,\" he explains. \"It lets me easily resolve problems that can't be quickly patched by rewriting code.\" These use cases include injecting cross-origin resource sharing headers, rewriting parameters, inspecting packets, performing A/B testing, and examining and routing incoming TLS traffic.\n\n\"Workers examines incoming requests to confirm that they're TLS 1.0, then routes these requests,\" Turner explains. \"Thanks to Workers, I was able to identify that a lot of this traffic was coming from our own servers, which were communicating over the Internet even though they sit next to each other in the same data center. I couldn't have identified this issue without Workers. Being able to execute code on the edge and route traffic accordingly saves us money and time.\"\n\nRecently, Turner used Workers to inject cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) headers and solve a communications problem between LendingTree's systems and one of its partner sites, operated by AOL. \"We were able to use Workers to identify the issue and restore service within minutes, with zero downtime and without any code changes,\" Turner recalls. \"Without Workers, we would have had to refactor the code and change servers, which would have taken weeks.\"\n\nWorkers has changed the way LendingTree conducts A/B testing. Prior to Workers, LendingTree had to perform all A/B testing on their side, using NGINX proxies. \"We had an entire A/B testing system that was written internally,\" Turner says. Now, LendingTree is beginning to use Cloudflare Workers to conduct A/B testing at the network edge, resulting in better performance with less complexity.\n\n\"Cloudflare Workers has been a game changer for LendingTree. We can run JavaScript asynchronously within or alongside a client session, manipulate data, and make decisions, without impacting performance or availability,\" Turner says. \"No other solution offers this functionality.\"\n\n### __Additional Cloudflare security and performance tools provide more protection, optimization, and cost savings__\n\nLendingTree has integrated a number of Cloudflare security and performance tools across the organization.\n\nFor example, LendingTree further hardened their protection against malicious bots by combining Bot Management with Cloudflare Rate Limiting and custom WAF rules. \"In the past four to five months, Cloudflare Rate Limiting has saved us approximately $250,000 by stopping abuse of our API endpoints,\" Turner says.\n\nThe Cloudflare WAF is another critical component of LendingTree's security defenses. \"The Cloudflare WAF is priced very well for all it offers, but more importantly, it's easy to use, and it works very well,\" Turner says. \"We no longer need dedicated teams to manage WAF rules or stay on top of threat intelligence feeds. The Cloudflare WAF takes care of everything for us.\"\n\nWhen LendingTree noticed that conversions were down, Google suggested that the company improve its page load times. Turner used Cloudflare's performance optimization tools to make some changes, then asked Google to check LendingTree's page load times again. Google's employees were astounded. \"Just by leveraging the built-in Cloudflare performance features, we improved page load times up to 70%,\" Turner recalls. \"Google's employees said they'd never seen site performance increase so quickly just by someone making a few changes.\"\n\nLendingTree uses Cloudflare TLS certificates to save money and prevent outages due to expired certificates. \"We have thousands of different properties. At that scale, it was only a matter of time before we'd miss renewing a certificate,\" Turner explains. \"Using Cloudflare's TLS certificates, which automatically renew, we save about $50,000 a year, both in administrative costs and lost revenue from outages due to expired certificates.\"\n\nTurner says that the savings LendingTree reaps from Cloudflare more than pays for the cost of Cloudflare's services. \"By enabling us to deliver our products fast, securely, and reliably, Cloudflare provides us with security at the speed of business,\" he says.\n",

						"shortDescription": "Partnering with Cloudflare enables WP Engine to optimize its WordPress hosting services.",
						"longDescription": "## __Partnering with Cloudflare plays a key role in WP Engine's delivery of the fastest, most secure managed WordPress hosting solution.__\n\nWP Engine is the world's most trusted WordPress technology company, used by more than 150,000 customers in 150 countries, powering the freedom to create with the most relied-upon brands and developer-centric WordPress products for companies and agencies of all sizes. \n\n### __Challenges: Enhance and offer a more robust managed hosting solution__\n\nAs a WordPress technology provider, WP Engine offers its customers leading performance and security optimizations along with hosting solutions. In 2018, the company began iterating on  a product that would couple performance enhancements with a web application firewall (WAF) and DDoS mitigation. WP Engine focused on how to protect customers against emerging threats and high-volume DDoS attacks, while exploring a chance to optimize performance and security internally, but it needed a partner to help build out this new product, which became known as [Global Edge Security](https://wpengine.com/global-edge-security/).\n\nAdditionally, WP Engine wanted to abstract away the complexity of DNS configurations for its customers and find additional options for SSL certificate management. \n\nWP Engine chose Cloudflare because it offered an expansive suite of performance and security solutions. After implementing Cloudflare DNS, WP Engine partnered with Cloudflare to build out its GES product, adding Cloudflare CDN, Argo Smart Routing, the Cloudflare WAF, and Cloudflare DDoS mitigation. WP Engine also added Cloudflare SSL for SaaS.\n\n### __Cloudflare DNS minimizes DNS-related support tickets__\n\nCloudflare DNS has significantly reduced DNS-related support tickets and improved the stability of WP Engine's hosting platform. Currently, WP Engine has about 4.7 million DNS entries on Cloudflare DNS. \n\nBecause Cloudflare uses an anycast network with a stable IP address, WP Engine's customers no longer have to reconfigure their DNS settings when WP Engine needs to migrate their sites on the back end. \"Customers configure their DNS settings only once, when they first onboard to WP Engine,\" says Michael Smith, Senior Architect. \"If we need to migrate them to another server, the change is invisible on their end.\"\n\nAdditionally, Cloudflare DNS is integrated into WP Engine's Domain Connect solution, which is based on an open standard that abstracts away the complexity of configuring DNS records. This has further reduced DNS-related support tickets when onboarding new customers. \n\nWP Engine and its customers have also benefited from Cloudflare BYOIP (Bring Your Own IP). \"Some of our customers want to run their sites on their apex domain instead of going through Cloudflare, and for technical reasons, they must point to specific IP addresses,\" Smith explains. \"BYOIP provides them with stable IP addresses to point at. This is very important, because this also enables those customers to use Global Edge Security.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare's security and performance solutions enable WP Engine to deliver excellent value-add with Global Edge Security__\n\nWP Engine's team worked closely with Cloudflare to build the Global Edge Security product, which integrates Cloudflare CDN and Argo Smart Routing, the latter of which improves performance by routing dynamic content around network congestion, with the Cloudflare WAF and DDoS mitigation.\n\n\"Our customers are very happy with Cloudflare's CDN,\" Smith says. \"Our previous CDN solution was only for static assets. Cloudflare's solution offers better performance because everything goes through the same origin.\"\n\nThe WP Engine team found Argo Smart Routing very easy to deploy, and the solution improved performance in two areas of the world where WP Engine had seen issues with high latency. \"Argo Smart Routing cut response times by 35% on average. The performance improvements were even greater for sites with global audiences.\"\n\nCloudflare worked closely with WP Engine's security team to craft managed rules for the WAF that were specifically tailored towards both WordPress and WP Engine's platform. \"We serve customers from many different industry verticals, and their security needs differ. Additionally, the security needs we have internally are different from our customers,\" explains Denver Serrao, Software Engineer. \"Cloudflare helped us set up rules that worked for both us and our customers.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare SSL for SaaS gets WP Engine out of the certificate management business and will play a key role in an upcoming product__\n\nWP Engine is gradually phasing in Cloudflare SSL for SaaS to manage its customers' SSL certificates. They expect this phase-in to accelerate once WP Engine launches its new Advanced Networking offering, in which SSL for SaaS will play a large role.\n\n\"We are looking forward to all of our customers being able to take advantage of the offerings of Advanced Network as opposed to just the customers who have opted in to Global Edge Security.\"\n\nThe WP Engine team eagerly awaits that day. \"Once we've migrated all of our customers to Cloudflare, we'll be able to focus on enhancing our product offerings instead of managing certificates.\"\n\n### __WP Engine raves about Cloudflare's customer support and pace of innovation__\n\nCloudflare's round-the-clock customer support gives WP Engine peace of mind that their customers are being cared for, while Cloudflare's rapid pace of innovation makes WP Engine confident that its partnership with Cloudflare will help further its vision and organizational goals.\n\n\"Cloudflare support is excellent,\" Serrao says. \"Whenever we've encountered an issue, with Global Edge Security or otherwise, Cloudflare has always been very responsive and has generally helped us solve the problem quickly.\"\n\nWP Engine's contacts at Cloudflare work closely with WP Engine to ensure that WP Engine is kept up to date on new Cloudflare products and product enhancements. \"Sometimes, Cloudflare has introduced us to very helpful new features that we didn't even think about,\" Smith says. \"The value of WP Engine's partnership with Cloudflare is continually increasing, which makes it easy to advocate further integration with Cloudflare to our company's leadership team.\"\n\n\"WP Engine has a true partnership with Cloudflare,\" adds Ellie Cooper, Senior Tech Partner Manager. \"Their team has helped us think strategically, and they're always willing to connect us with product managers to get a first look at new solutions that Cloudflare is developing.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "The County of San Luis Obispo uses Cloudflare's Project Fair Shot to provide equal access to COVID-19 appointments.",
						"longDescription": "## __County of San Luis Obispo Ensures Equitable COVID-19 Vaccine Access with Project Fair Shot__\n\nThe County of San Luis Obispo, California provides over 700 public services to its 277,000 residents — including distributing vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The county operates three vaccination clinics located at its major population centers.  Each week, between 2,000 and 7,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses are distributed within the county.  An estimated 81,000 residents are eligible for vaccination in the first phase of the country's program, and it has issued over 31,000 first doses and 14,000 second doses to date.\n\nOn Thursday mornings at 9 AM, when appointment slots for the next week are made available, approximately 23,000 people visit the county's vaccination website attempting to book an appointment for eligible residents. These traffic surges frequently overwhelmed the scheduling application, resulting in site outages and accidental double-bookings. \n\n### __Searching for the Right Solution__\n\nThe County of San Luis Obispo is committed to providing equal access to the vaccine. This includes operating a call center and enabling online vaccine scheduling. However, ensuring fairness with an online portal is difficult, as visitors with faster Internet connections and clicking speeds have a distinct advantage.\n\nThe county has explored several options for its vaccine portal. Platforms designed for event registration exist but often have language about selling tickets, which did not fit their use case.  Additionally, some of these platforms were found to fail under the heavy traffic associated with COVID-19 appointment scheduling. Other options designed for scheduling meetings within an organization had similar scalability issues.\n\nThe county's web team settled on Google Forms and Worksheets for implementing its vaccine registration system. Google Forms allowed the creation of scripts that automatically opened and closed appointment time slots as they are filled. Forms also feeds data to a Google Worksheet which is used by the call center and for email confirmations.\n\n### __Cloudflare's Project Fair Shot Enables Equal Access__\n\nThe switch to Google Forms enabled the site to scale to meet load, but the county still had a problem: the scripts running behind Google Forms needed time to run and close booked appointment slots. Thousands of simultaneous visitors didn't allow for this time, and slots were occasionally double-booked. These double-bookings could be resolved by the call center, but it was still a disappointment for those who needed to reschedule.\n\nA county employee following the Cloudflare blog learned of the launch of [Project Fair Shot](https://www.cloudflare.com/fair-shot/). This is a free program that enables COVID-19 vaccine distributors to set up Cloudflare Waiting Room in front of their scheduling sites and applications. Waiting Room creates a queue for visitors to the site and limits the number of visitors interacting with the application at one time. This ensures that sites are not overwhelmed and provides fair, first-come-first-served access to appointments with no modifications needed to the scheduling application.\n\nBecause vaccines are allocated on a weekly basis, the county's web team had a few days to design its waiting room. According to Tyler Penney, the county's Web Services Administrator, \"We spent a couple days working with our media relations folks, working with our web team, to be able to build out this nice little waiting room. So we had a little bit of fun with the design of it, we made these little icons with people in line with masks on and we tried to make it kind of just a nice place to be.\"\n\nThe day before the next batch of vaccines was due to be released, the team filled out the form to activate their waiting room. Working with the Cloudflare team, they were able to configure Cloudflare Waiting Room and improved their caching configurations to minimize load on their servers.  The next morning, the county's web team performed a test to ensure that everything was working as expected. Penney says that it was a quick and painless process, \"The Cloudflare team was wonderful helping us. When we have any questions, they're able to quickly answer and help us to set it up.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, the site experienced the usual rush of visitors.  At 7 AM, the first of the approximately 23,000 visitors started to arrive, waiting for vaccine appointment registration to begin at 9.  This time, the site was ready, and visitors were placed in the Waiting Room and provided with information about their current position in line.  Starting at 9 AM, the doors opened and the first group was allowed into the scheduling application.\n\n### __Appointment Scheduling is Transparent and Fair with Cloudflare Waiting Room__\n\nWith Project Fair Shot, the County of San Luis Obispo is able to ensure that scheduling vaccine appointments is an equitable and transparent process for its citizens. According to Penney, \"It's not Lord of the Flies anymore, which, you know, basically is what it was before. If you had a fast Internet connection or you could click really quickly, that would give you an advantage on getting a vaccine.\"\n\nCloudflare Waiting Room allows residents to enter in groups of two hundred with a few minutes between groups. This ensures that the Forms-based portal is able to keep up with the load and that the backend scripts have time to run.  These smaller groups also allow the county's web team to monitor progress and ensure that everything is working correctly.  Penney says, \"With Cloudflare Waiting Room, we can see everything fill up over time, but it happens at a pace that's manageable.  To be able to breathe a little bit and watch the numbers, watch the registrations happen, watch all the slots fill up, it's really great.\"\n\nCitizens in the Waiting Room receive regular updates regarding their place in line and the availability of vaccine appointments. When their turn comes, the page automatically refreshes and grants access to the scheduling application. As appointment slots become full, typically within the first hour, residents are advised to check back the following day for any available slots.\n\nRecently, the County of San Luis Obispo has transitioned to a lottery-based appointment scheduling system to improve access to vaccines. Residents eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine can sign up once and are automatically notified each week if they have been selected for an appointment that week. Cloudflare Waiting Room remains in place to ensure that residents still have a positive experience even if traffic suddenly surges, such as when eligibility opens up for a new group.\n\nThe county has received positive feedback from several citizens on the usability and transparency of the new system. Penney says, \"Our County Motto is 'Not for Ourselves Alone'. It's a joy to work with a company that shares our values and our commitment to a better society.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare Security Solutions Help CCP Games Stop DDoS Attacks & Credential-Stuffing Bots__\n\nHeadquartered in Reykjavík, Iceland, CCP Games develops cutting-edge, massively multiplayer online (MMO) games — including EVE Online, an MMO whose 300,000+ active players populate a virtual universe, traveling in intricate spacecrafts that require years of time and thousands of dollars to build. \n\nEVE Online's global player base forge real connections with one another and spend real money in-game. Transaction errors and other glitches that detract from the in-game experience are unacceptable. DDoS attacks that slow game servers or take them down completely are devastating to game developers.\n\nAccount takeovers (ATOs) are also a big issue in the gaming industry. User credentials for MMO games fetch high prices on the Dark Web. In addition to in-game currency and digital assets, these accounts contain valuable personal identifying information (PII) and payment card data.\n\nCCP Games must maintain the highest standards for reliability, performance, and security to protect their players from data breaches and ensure that they have a flawless experience.\n\n### __Challenge: Prevent DDoS attacks and account takeovers (ATOs)__\n\nGames like EVE Online, where players accumulate high-value digital assets, are major targets for credential stuffing attacks. Cybercriminals obtain lists of user credentials stolen during data breaches, then use bots to run these lists against game login pages. If a set of credentials works, the cybercriminals take over the user account, steal its digital assets, and resell them. \"EVE Online's virtual space empires are a serious real-world business, and many players invest thousands of dollars in their digital assets,\" explains Nicholas Herring, Technical Director of Infrastructure. \n\nBecause EVE Online is community-driven, most of what occurs within its virtual universe is dictated by the gamers themselves. CCP Games straddles a fine line between exposing enough of its infrastructure to provide gamers with a terrific in-game experience, but not so much that it threatens CCP Games' infrastructure. \"DDoS attacks are becoming more sophisticated,\" Herring says. \"Attackers will target specific parts of our infrastructure, like a certain gameport or a certain form.\"\n\nCybercriminals also seek out and take advantage of other vulnerabilities. \"We expose a lot of third-party APIs. If an API returns an empty list opposed to a null result, attackers can weaponize it. We have to be really careful about how much information we expose.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Magic Transit & Cloudflare Spectrum stop persistent DDoS attacks__\n\nFor some time, CCP Games' attempts to mitigate DDoS attacks were less than effective. Herring says that internal efforts were complicated by CCP Games' unusual infrastructure, which requires both a TCP proxy and an IP proxy. \"Our game ports use the TCP protocol, and we were putting a lot of effort into traffic identification, tuning, and earmarking, but nothing was working,\" Herring says. \"Additionally, attackers knew what our IP addresses were, so they were coming after us there, too.\"\n\nAfter evaluating many other vendors' solutions, CCP Games chose a combination of Cloudflare Magic Transit and Cloudflare Spectrum. \"Some companies only offered a Magic Transit-like solution for IP addresses, and others only provided a Spectrum-like proxy solution. Only Cloudflare offered solutions that could secure both the L3 and L4 layers of our network. The combination of Magic Transit at the L3 layer and Spectrum on L4 provided the ideal solution for our setup.\"\n\nWhen CCP Games partnered with Cloudflare, they were facing an active DDoS attack. \"We landed like a meteor in Cloudflare's lap,\" Herring says. \"It was an all-hands-on-deck situation. Everyone at CCP was involved, including the CEO in some cases.\"\n\nHerring raves about Cloudflare's willingness to tailor its solutions to work with CCP Games' existing infrastructure. \"At no point during the onboarding process did anyone at Cloudflare say, 'Sorry, but it doesn't work that way.' Cloudflare did things that needed to be done in an emergency situation. They had the correct combination of countermeasures, and they displayed the ability to easily and transparently expand those countermeasures.\"\n\nCCP Games' customers immediately noticed the switch to Cloudflare. \"We didn't have to tell them; they told us,\" Herring laughs. Customers also noticed an improvement in performance and reliability, especially in Australia, and some of them dropped the VPNs they had purchased to connect to CCP's data center. \"When players get to a certain level in EVE Online, they spend $8,000 of time and materials to build a ship,\" Herring explains. \"Because they invested that sort of money, they'd also buy VPNs into our data center to guarantee reliability. This isn't about performance so much as a continuous connection. Now, we've heard anecdotes about customers dropping those VPNs because they feel they don't need them anymore.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management stops customer account takeovers by blocking credential-stuffing bots__\n\nPrior to implementing Cloudflare Bot Management, CCP Games depended on manual processes, such as IP throttling, to mitigate credential stuffing bots. However, because of the distributed nature of such attacks, these measures had limited effect. Additionally, as the attacks increased in frequency, CCP's team struggled to keep up. \"We were getting a lot of customer service tickets about account takeovers,\" Herring says. \"The attacks would happen in giant bursts, targeting anywhere from 500,000 to one million user accounts at a time.\"\n\nFollowing a spate of credential stuffing attacks from July through September, one of CCP Games' engineers suggested that the company look into Cloudflare's Bot Management solution, which they had read about on social media. Bot Management examines each HTTP request and assigns it a \"Bot Score\" that measures the likelihood that the request is from a bot. A score of 1 indicates that a request is almost certainly from a bot, not a real person. CCP Games decided to implement Bot Management and trigger a Captcha challenge for all requests with a score of 1.\n\nShortly after implementing Bot Management, the solution caught and blocked an attack where bots attempted to use nearly 8,000 stolen login credentials to access EVE Online. \"Since implementing Bot Management, we haven't seen a single credential stuffing attack hit our front door, which is an enormous improvement. It blocks credential-stuffing bots with 99% accuracy, and it's very easy to use. We pushed a button, and Bot Management did its job. We didn't have to do anything. We have the option of dialing down the Bot Score, but it's not even worth adjusting, because the standard  setting is working for us. Bot Analytics has made it very easy for us to spot a bot attack. It provides us visibility into the bot traffic by showing bot score distribution in the dashboard.\"\n\nHerring reports that the percentage of Captchas that are successfully resolved is hovering around 1.5%. \"Since this number is a pretty good estimate of 'false positives,' this means that nearly all of the requests that Bot Management is blocking are bad. The solution is having negligible impact on legitimate player logins, and customer complaints about account takeovers have plummeted.\"\n\nHerring and his team at CCP Games are avid readers of Cloudflare's company blog, and he says they are always on the lookout for additional solutions that would benefit the company. \"When our customers think of Cloudflare, they think of your CDN solution, but Cloudflare is so much more than a CDN provider. What Cloudflare is doing for CCP Games is not trivial. There is no way that we could build these solutions in-house, and maintain them, cost-effectively or on the same level of expertise as Cloudflare.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "Based in Bangalore, India, Alice Blue is a discount stock broker that offers an online share trading platform for investors to trade stocks and commodities on several major national exchanges. The company also offers depository services through its partnership with Central Depository Services Ltd. The company has been named the Best Broking House in South India, as well as the Best Stock Brokerage Company in the Energy category.\n\nOnline security breaches are particularly damaging for financial services organizations like Alice Blue. In addition to lost revenues, frequent outages can damage a company's reputation, resulting in a loss in consumer confidence and even capital risks.\n\n### __Challenge: Stop frequent DDoS attacks that were damaging performance and causing outages__\n\nAlice Blue was struggling with persistent DDoS attacks, which compromised performance and caused its platform to go down completely an average of twice per month. \n\n\"The stock trading industry moves very fast. Every millisecond counts,\" explains Nagarjun Ramesh, Alice Blue's CTO. \"Our customers are paying us for this service, and they expect it to be available and working well at all times. In fintech, performance is a major competitive differentiator.\"\n\nAlice Blue attempted to mitigate the attacks by deploying a load balancer and content delivery network (CDN), but these measures could not keep up with the number and size of attacks the company was experiencing.\n\n### __Cloudflare DDoS, WAF, Rate Limiting, and Argo Smart Routing stop DDoS attacks and dramatically improve performance__\n\nAfter starting out with Cloudflare's free plan, which includes DDoS mitigation and a CDN, Nagarjun saw strong results and found the Cloudflare platform easy to configure. He upgraded to a paid subscription and added Argo Smart Routing — which detects real-time network congestion and routes web traffic across the fastest and most reliable network paths — as well as Cloudflare's WAF and Rate Limiting offerings. \n\nAfter Cloudflare, Alice Blue saw immediate improvements. \"Cloudflare's security suite blocks threats.\" Nagarjun says.  \"We went from constant DDoS attacks to none.\" \n\nMeanwhile, the addition of Argo Smart Routing dramatically increased the performance of Alice Blue's platform. \"That's far superior to what our previous performance vendor was able to achieve,\" Nagarjun notes. \n\nIn addition to stopping DDoS attacks and dramatically enhancing performance, Cloudflare's reporting and metrics help Alice Blue maintain regulatory compliance in their highly regulated industry. \n\n\"We have to provide regulators with a lot of detailed reports and metrics regarding security and availability,\" Nagarjun explains. \"In addition to helping us maintain compliance by hardening our security and ensuring our platform is reliable, Cloudflare offers reporting features that are a tremendous help during compliance audits. We can access all of the data we need through Cloudflare's dashboard, instead of having to collate it from different places.\"\n\nThat said, Nagarjun notes that making his customers happy is just as important as making regulators happy. \"We're the number one broking house in South India, but we want to be number one in the whole country. For that to happen, we have to provide our customers with world-class service. Cloudflare is helping us achieve that.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "Founded in 2005, Panagora is a multi-disciplinary digital agency with a focus on online retailers of fashion and lifestyle products. Panagora was originally created to deal with uptime and performance issues with sneaker releases and managing traffic peaks like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Their clients now include SneakersnStuff, BabyShop.com and more. The company's mission is to help its clients become winners in their categories through high-performing, user-friendly ecommerce solutions. Panagora's proprietary ecommerce platform, Panagora EDGE, is built to deliver high performance and 100% availability at scale.\n\n### __Challenge: Mitigate malicious traffic that was significantly degrading site performance__\n\n[Ecommerce sites](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) are major targets for malicious bots, including scalper bots, which buy large numbers of limited-edition items for later resale at a higher price. These bots often deplete retailers' stocks of particular items within seconds of product release, shutting out legitimate customers. Additionally, the sudden traffic spikes from these bots degrade site performance.\n\n\"Normally, about 20% to 40% of traffic to ecommerce sites is automated,\" explains Fredrik Schweinebarth, CTO & Co-Founder of Panagora. \"When an in-demand product is launched, bots detect the listing within two minutes, and almost immediately, traffic to the site spikes tenfold, and about 80% of that traffic is bad bots.\"\n\nPanagora attempted to mitigate the bots using homegrown solutions, with limited success. \"Combating these bots is extremely difficult, as they're constantly evolving and becoming sophisticated. Web application firewall rules can catch some bots, but not smart bots,\" Schweinebarth says. \"Our reputation and our ability to keep our relationships with our clients were at risk, because we couldn't provide our customers with a reliable and scalable ecommerce platform. We needed a tool to mitigate malicious traffic.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management Shuts Down Bad Bots & Keeps Panagora's Clients Online__\n\nAfter researching multiple solutions, Schweinebarth chose Cloudflare's Bot Management solution. \"We were already using Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation and Argo Smart Routing performance solution, and we had a good relationship with Cloudflare,\" Schweinebarth recalls. \"We knew that Cloudflare was developing a bot management solution, and we held off until it was ready instead of partnering with an additional vendor.\"\n\nPanagora implemented Cloudflare Bot Management and saw immediate results in reduction of malicious bot traffic. \"In addition to minimizing strain on our services, this enabled our clients to improve their customers' experience,\" Schweinebarth says. \"Customers had a chance to purchase products instead of the products being snatched up by scalper bots.\" \n\nAdditionally, Cloudflare's Bot Analytics gave Panagora better insights into malicious traffic, a better understanding of cybercriminals and how to mitigate cyberattacks, improved transparency of what traffic comes through its origin, and the ability to quickly mitigate issues related to sudden traffic spikes.\n\n\"The analytical insight that Cloudflare Bot Management gives us is very important,\" notes Moon-Suck Song, CEO and Co-Founder. \"The ability to understand how much of our traffic is bots enables us to improve our cybersecurity measures as a whole.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Security, Performance, and Serverless Solutions Provide Additional Protection & Optimization__\n\nPanagora is a Cloudflare Agency Partner and uses a wide array of Cloudflare products in addition to Bot Management. These include the Cloudflare WAF, DDoS mitigation, Argo Smart Routing, Access, and Workers.\n\nPanagora first partnered with Cloudflare to mitigate large-scale DDoS attacks. \"We had tried different partners, but they all came up short. The difference between our previous providers and Cloudflare was like night and day,\" Schweinebarth recalls. \"By 2016, we were using Cloudflare to improve security and performance for all of our clients. As both Cloudflare and Panagora grew, we subscribed to more Cloudflare services, and Cloudflare is now an integral part of our platform.\"\n\nPanagora has especially benefited from Argo Smart Routing, which improves page load times by routing dynamic content around network congestion. \"Argo Smart Routing is a service we take for granted,\" Schweinebarth says. \"It's so easy to use. You literally push a button, and Argo makes your site faster.\"\n\nPanagora uses Access, which extends zero-trust access to corporate and SaaS applications, to secure internal tools, like JIRA and Confluence as well as some legacy [APIs](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/api-security/). \"Previously, our legacy APIs only supported authentication using access control lists, which have a lot of downsides, especially since everyone is in the cloud now,\" says Schweinebarth. \"Cloudflare Access is an easy and secure way to maintain API access control. Our partners can be more innovative with their integrations, and we don't need to update our legacy APIs.\"\n\nPanagora uses Workers, Cloudflare's serverless development platform, for use cases ranging from behavior tracking to data export to SEO optimization. \"Currently, we're using Workers to add specific data points to headers to send to our origin for tracking in our local login environment,\" he explains. \"We also use it to help one of our clients create small modules to export data, such as sitemaps. We built a Worker that can provide an updated sitemap to Google's site crawlers.\"\n\nPanagora also uses Workers to enhance performance of the Panagora EDGE's shopping cart. \"Sometimes, if a high-demand product is out of stock, our app cache may not be able to update in time, and consumers can add unavailable items to their cart,\" Schweinebarth says. \"Workers lets us cache product stock data on Cloudflare's edge so that it updates much faster, and consumers will get an out-of-stock alert instead of being able to add that item to their cart. This enhances our platform by enabling our clients to avoid disappointing their customers.\"\n\nAs Panagora continues to grow into other verticals including beauty, interiors, and consumer electronics, they are excited to continue their partnership with Cloudflare. \n\n\"Thanks to Cloudflare, we have nearly unlimited capacity to scale, so we can take on much bigger clients than previously and solve their biggest pain points,\" Song says. \"Not only do we solve the pain associated with scraper bots spoiling product releases, but we also improve the user experience for our retailers' customers.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## Cloudflare enables the University of Western Australia to deliver modern, secure digital experiences\n\nEstablished in 1911, the University of Western Australia (UWA) is a public university consistently ranked in the top 1% of academic institutions worldwide. The university maintains two campuses and over 75 research and training centres across Australia. In addition to 22 schools offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in everything from medicine to music, UWA receives over $71 million of external research income annually.\n\n### __Challenge: Replace outdated legacy systems with modern performance & security solutions to deliver fast & secure digital experiences__\n\nAs a multifaceted institution with many external partners, UWA faced a variety of challenges. One is straddling a thin line between enabling access to sensitive data and systems while still protecting it from unauthorized parties. \"In a corporate environment, digital assets can be locked away behind a firewall, but some of our systems and data must be left open to enable global collaboration,\" explains Warwick Calkin, Chief Digital and Information Officer.\n\nAnother challenge was complex, outdated infrastructure. \"UWA had about 1,200 different legacy systems, about half of which were unknown or not managed very well,\" explains Cam Marshall, Associate Director, Infrastructure & Platforms. This complexity made it harder to comply with the cybersecurity standards needed to compete for defence research projects with the Australian government. It also complicated the university's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n\"For years, our tech landscape had been significantly under-invested, and then COVID-19 fundamentally changed the way we needed to deliver education and perform research,\" says Peter Seddon, Assistant Director of Strategy, Architecture, Portfolio & Business Intelligence. \"A campus no longer refers to a physical place, but a collection of people.\"\n\nFor several years, UWA had been using Cloudflare's CDN on a few subdomains. Faced with an urgent need to phase out their legacy technology and secure their externally facing systems, UWA chose to expand the relationship.\n\n### __UWA uses Cloudflare DNS to consolidate over 18,000 DNS records and establish a single source of truth__\n\nCloudflare DNS enabled UWA to transform its entire DNS infrastructure, decommission its legacy DNS hardware, consolidate thousands of DNS records into a single source of truth, and radically simplify its internal legacy DNS by removing all external sites and focusing exclusively on on-campus services. These external sites included over 130 web properties run by UWA affiliates and associates. Once UWA moved all of those sites behind Cloudflare DNS, the university was able to implement WAF protection for them, use common Cloudflare Certificates to transform SSL security certificate management, and establish governance policies and processes for those affiliates and associates to follow moving forward.\n\n\"Cloudflare enabled us to consolidate over 18,000 DNS records and significantly simplify our landscape,\" Seddon says. \"It's difficult to convey the extreme magnitude of this change. Prior to implementing Cloudflare, some of our project managers told us that they'd never seen this level of complexity before, in any educational institution or business.\"\n\nAdditionally, with its DNS structure simplified, UWA is now able to provide better, more secure WiFi to students, faculty, and guests\n\n### __Cloudflare WAF enables UWA to reduce its attack surface and gain visibility into its threat environment__\n\nUsing Cloudflare WAF, UWA implemented a firewall allowlist to block all website access except for a nominated set of IPs, greatly reducing the university's attack surface and establishing a foundation for the safe, progressive migration of all remaining services behind Cloudflare WAF.\n\n\"Cloudflare WAF has moved our risk outside of UWA,\" Marshall adds. \"Prior to Cloudflare, we had unmanaged systems that were at risk for DDoS and other cyberattacks. With the WAF in place, if we have a problem, our internal business operations can continue uninterrupted.\"\n\nPrior to implementing Cloudflare WAF, UWA lacked visibility into its data environment. As a result, the university took a proactive approach to security, responding to cyberattacks instead of acting to prevent them. Implementing Cloudflare WAF and integrating it with Splunk has transformed UWA's approach to cybersecurity. \n\n\"Integrating the Cloudflare WAF with Splunk has provided us with a thorough understanding of our infrastructure and complete visibility into our threat environment,\" Marshall says. \"We can now engage in preemptive security measures.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare solutions have uncovered new opportunities for UWA__\n\nSeddon notes that the infrastructure changes Cloudflare have enabled create opportunities for further improvements, such as implementing processes to use Cloudflare's network security capabilities to identify, triage, and block external network cyberattacks.\n\n\"At the outset, no one at the University of Western Australia fully estimated the positive impact of implementing Cloudflare's security and performance solutions,\" Seddon notes. \"Cloudflare enabled The University of Western Australia to achieve far more than we originally anticipated and put us in a stronger position to securely manage our Internet-facing network.\"\n\nCalkin appreciates the investment in local support that Cloudflare provides in Western Australia, which is unique to Cloudflare. \"Western Australia is the country's most remote province,\" he explains. \"Vendor presence is poor on this side of the country, and some services simply aren't available here. Cloudflare has made local investments in Western Australia that other vendors haven't. We get local support provided by local people. I wish all of our vendor engagements were like Cloudflare.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "evo secures its site against DDoS and malicious requests, and reduces complexity by consolidating performance, security, and serverless solutions with a single vendor, Cloudflare.",
						"longDescription": "## evo uses Cloudflare to reduce internal complexity, enhance security, and improve performance\n\nBased in Seattle, Washington, evo is an omni-channel retailer specializing in outdoor sports and lifestyle gear, including skiing, snowboarding, mountain biking, surfing, and camping gear. Its online store is responsible for about 85% of its sales, and evo's two biggest selling days of the year are Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\n\nLike all [online retailers](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/), evo has to deal with automated traffic, nefarious crawlers, malicious bots, and the threat of DDoS and other attacks. Unlike legitimate customer traffic, which is stable and predictable, malicious requests often come in giant spikes, which can degrade site performance.\n\n### __Challenge: Protect against DDoS and malicious requests, and reduce complexity by consolidating performance & security solutions__\n\nAs evo's business has grown, so too has their risk of DDoS and other forms of cyber attack. At key times of the year, an attack leading to downtime could prove extremely costly. This risk concerned Ben Plehal, Director of Technology. \"When sales are at their holiday peak and every minute of website uptime is critical, we simply can't afford to have an attack disrupt our ability to serve our customers.\"\n\nevo was also unsatisfied with its content delivery network (CDN). evo's first CDN partner was Akamai, which became expensive as they scaled. The company then switched to Verizon Edgecast. However, Verizon's CDN was difficult to configure, and Verizon didn't offer other services evo needed.\n\n\"Verizon simply offered a CDN - WAF, DDoS protection, and DNS services were all expensive add-ons or integrations with other vendors,\" Plehal recalled. \"We were using a separate managed DNS service. It wasn't expensive, but it was yet another bill and another set of configurations for us to manage. Complexity is my team's enemy. We wanted one vendor to provide us with all of the security and performance solutions we needed.\"\n\nCloudflare turned out to be that vendor. evo signed up for Cloudflare's security and performance product suites, which includes Cloudflare WAF, DDoS, CDN, Rate Limiting, DNS, and Argo Smart Routing, as well as Workers, Cloudflare's serverless computing solution.\n\n### __Cloudflare WAF blocks malicious requests and lets evo's team isolate problematic pockets of traffic__\n\nAfter implementing WAF with all features enabled in test mode, evo pushed it live and has been happy with it ever since. Most of the time, his team uses the built-in rules, and Plehal reports that it's easy to configure custom rules for specific use cases when needed.\n\n\"My team no longer has to work to stay ahead of bad actors, because Cloudflare protects our site from DDoS and malicious requests,\" Plehal says. \"Cloudflare's WAF blocks an average of 80,000 to 90,000 malicious requests per week. My team and I sleep much better now, especially during the holiday shopping season.\" \n\nPlehal likes the insight he gets from the WAF analytics and the log simulate feature, which allow his team to identify potentially problematic traffic. Recently, when an evo engineer noticed a big spike in TCP incoming requests, the team quickly created a log simulate rule within the WAF, which enabled them to identify the traffic as originating from one of its own vendors. \n\n\"The vendor was aggressively spidering our pages in the wake of an email blast to see if our products were in stock,\" Plehal explains. \"Their intentions weren't malicious, but they were making 150 requests each second to our product details pages, which caused performance degradation. Thanks to the WAF analytics and log simulate rule, we discerned what was going on, which allowed us to work with the vendor and find an alternative way for them to confirm our products were in stock.\"\n\nWith the WAF taking care of traffic spikes from malicious requests, evo focuses on ensuring its site can scale to handle legitimate traffic. \"Because we don't need to accommodate giant spikes of automated traffic, we can service the same amount of human traffic with fewer resources. For example, if we had 10 web service instances before deploying Cloudflare WAF, we might get by with only 6 or 8 now.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers enables evo to retire a legacy web service, reducing complexity and minimizing their potential attack surface__\n\nevo had built a legacy web service to perform file-name mapping for millions of product images. The service took incoming requests from evo.com and mapped them to the image blob files in cloud storage. When evo decided to migrate to Microsoft Azure, they were looking at having to redesign this service and build it out in Azure, a complicated and time-consuming process.\n\nInstead, evo decided to use Cloudflare Workers to perform this function and pass image requests straight from the edge to Azure Blob Storage, without the requests hitting evo's servers. \"Thanks to Cloudflare Workers, we no longer have to maintain a special service just to map legacy file names,\" Plehal says. \"We don't have to pay to run it, worry about it going down, or worry about it becoming a vulnerability. Eliminating it reduced our potential cyberattack surface by simplifying our service topology.\"\n\nPlehal is seeking out additional use cases for Workers. \"Workers holds great promise in the way it could simplify tasks for our servers. Because it enables us to perform compute operations at the network edge, we're investigating whether we can use it to handle more logic and reduce load on our origin services.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare simplifies internal processes, and Argo Smart Routing dramatically improves page load times__\n\nPlehal reports that his team was thrilled when he demonstrated Cloudflare's dashboard. \"Our previous CDN dashboards were notoriously difficult to use. Not only is Cloudflare's dashboard much simpler, but we now have one place to manage and view analytics for our DNS, performance suite, and security suite.\"\n\n[Improving page load times is always](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) a focus for retailers like evo, which uses many media- and image-rich pages. Argo Smart Routing, which finds the fastest network paths for traffic, has significantly improved evo's page load times. \"There's a direct correlation between site speed and conversions, so speed is the same as money for us,\" Plehal says. \"Argo Smart Routing has improved our page load times by nearly 40%.\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare Magic Transit put a halt to frequent DDoS attacks that were taking Godwin Heights Public School's classrooms offline and consuming student learning time.",
						"longDescription": "## Cloudflare Magic Transit protects Godwin Heights Public School District against frequent, damaging DDoS attacks\n\nGodwin Heights PSD is a K-12 school district located near Grand Rapids, Michigan, comprising four school campuses and an alternative education learning center. As a participant in Michigan's School of Choice program, Godwin Heights attracts many students from Grand Rapids whose families are seeking a more small-town school environment. \n\n\"Many of our students' families are financially disadvantaged. Some of them are homeless, living in vehicles or in shelters,\" explains Johann Radloff, Director of Information Services. \"Our district gets a lot of funding for free lunches and other programs to meet our students' socioeconomic and emotional needs. As a district, we're really focused on equity, in both education and in meeting our student's social and emotional needs.\"\n\n### __Challenge: Persistent DDoS attacks constantly knocked Godwin Heights schools offline__\n\nGodwin Heights was suffering repeated DDoS attacks, often perpetrated by students themselves. \"We've changed our IP address a bunch of times, but the attackers would just change their attack to the new IPs,\" Radloff recalls. \"That tells me the attackers were familiar with our system.\"\n\nThis problem is not unique to Godwin Heights PSD. \"Other school districts have the same issues,\" Radloff says. \"Sometimes, students want to bring down the system to get a day off school or avoid a test. Sometimes, they just want to prove they can do it, and sometimes, they don't even understand what they're doing.\"\n\nThe attacks caused considerable classroom downtime, to the point that teachers began preparing paper lessons and assignments as backups in case the internet went down. In addition, attacks during the standardized testing season cost the district money. \"We have to hire and pay outside subs as proctors for testing week,\" Radloff says. \"If there was an attack during that week, we'd end up having to repeat the process because some of the tests wouldn't go through.\" \n\nUnfortunately, the DDoS mitigation service provided by Godwin Heights' ISP was of little help. \"Even getting them to turn it on was painful,\" Radloff says. \"I'd have to monitor for attacks throughout the day, and when one started, I would call our internet vendor, and they'd call the ISP to turn on the DDoS mitigation service. Even when the vendor finally turned the mitigation on, it took long enough for it to have any effect that our network traffic would slow to a crawl. I don't know how much traffic they were mitigating, but we had a lot to handle, and our ISP DDoS service wasn't handling it.\"\n\n### __Solution: Magic Transit lets Godwin Heights PSD focus on educating students, not working around DDoS attacks__\n\nRadloff was introduced to Cloudflare Magic Transit, which protects entire IP subnets from DDoS attacks, when she received a phone call from a Cloudflare representative. She was immediately impressed with the representative's empathy and professionalism: \"He clearly wanted to go above and beyond to solve our DDoS problems. He talked about Cloudflare's work with other school districts and demonstrated how Magic Transit could help us.\"\n\nWithin the first two weeks of deployment, Magic Transit blocked hundreds of large DDoS attacks. \"I didn't have to tweak, adjust, or change anything. It just worked,\" she says. \"I no longer have to sit at my desk and wait for DDoS attacks to happen. Magic Transit just blocks them, and Cloudflare sends me weekly emails letting me know about it. I share the emails with our accounting department so they can see the value we're getting from Magic Transit.\"\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic forced Godwin Heights PSD to switch to remote learning, its students were hit extremely hard. Because many students' families lacked home internet access, the district worked to provide them with free wireless hotspots and cobble together devices that students could take home. Eventually, the district implemented a hybrid learning scenario where families can choose between face-to-face and virtual learning. However, if students become ill or are exposed, they must be quarantined and use virtual learning during that time.\n\nThe last thing Radloff and her teachers needed to worry about was a DDoS attack. \"Between all the stress from the pandemic and the DDoS attacks we experienced last year, our teachers were scared. We're working really hard to ensure that virtual students get the same quality of education as in-person students, and a DDoS attack would be a catastrophe,\" Radloff says. \"I was so happy to tell them that I had a new service in place, and they didn't need to worry about DDoS. They can focus on teaching and all of the other issues our students are experiencing because of COVID-19. I can't stress enough how much that peace of mind means to us.\"\n\nAt the time of this interview, Godwin Heights was approaching the one-year anniversary of its last DDoS attack. \"Cloudflare Magic Transit has made a huge difference to Godwin Heights Public School District. Last year, I had to sit at my desk and monitor for DDoS attacks. This year, I can focus on other duties because Magic Transit blocks these attacks.\"",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare Workers acts as OneTrust serverless architecture, and Cloudflare security and access management solutions enhance OneTrust's context-aware zero trust security.",
						"longDescription": "## OneTrust integrates Cloudflare solutions into its own infrastructure & customer applications\n\nOneTrust helps companies be more trusted and use technology to make trust a competitive advantage. It is the fastest-growing privately held company in the U.S., with a stunning 48,000% three-year growth rate. Over 7,500 businesses worldwide utilize OneTrust's SaaS solutions to manage privacy, security, and governance to comply with regulations such as the CCPA, GDPR, LGPD, PDPA, and ISO27001. \n\n### __Challenge: Deploy efficient, scalable, and cost-effective performance & security solutions to support tremendous growth__\n\nWhen CTO Blake Brannon first joined OneTrust, the company was using its cloud service provider's native security tools to protect its SaaS platform, as well as the cloud provider's compute function to run custom code for its most visible product: website cookie banners. Access to OneTrust's internal apps was protected by a VPN. Brannon wanted more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective performance and security solutions to support the company's tremendous growth. \n\n\"OneTrust is growing very quickly, and international privacy regulations are continuously changing,\" Brannon explains. \"We need agility and the ability to scale quickly and efficiently. The solutions we were using weren't robust enough to handle our growth.\"\n\nOneTrust started with Cloudflare's core performance and security suite, including Cloudflare WAF. As OneTrust grew, the company added Rate Limiting, Argo Smart Routing, SSL for SaaS, Workers, and Access.\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers halves latency & dramatically reduces egress costs__\n\nCloudflare Workers acts as OneTrust's serverless architecture, helping the company deliver crucial product features while minimizing latency, costs, and development time. \n\nOne such product is OneTrust's [Cookie Consent](https://www.onetrust.com/products/cookie-compliance/) product, privacy pop-up banners that are personalized based on each site visitor's location. These banners — which are often key to complying with the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other regional privacy regulations — appear when a visitor from a jurisdiction covered by one of these regulations visits a website. The banners inform visitors that their data may be collected and used for certain purposes and to obtain their consent to use the data. \n\n\"Until a user sets their consent preferences, certain functions on the website, such as tracking functions, stay off until the user gives consent,\" Brannon explains. \"The banners depend on custom code that runs a geo-locator to look up the visitor's jurisdiction, then dynamically load the appropriate policy banner. Depending on where a visitor is located, they may not need to see a banner at all, or they may need to see one that disables certain functions but not others.\"\n\nPrior to implementing Cloudflare Workers, OneTrust used their cloud services provider's compute functions to run the code for these banners. This added a lot of complexity to the code and development process. Additionally, because the service gets approximately 64 billion hits each week, OneTrust also encountered latency issues and very high egress costs. Switching to Workers significantly reduced costs and latency. \"It was massive,\" Brannon says. \"Latency was halved, and our costs went down by 90%.\" \n\nOneTrust also used Workers to deploy a new product feature that synchronizes a visitor's consent across devices. \"If a user visits a website on a desktop and provides their consent preferences, Workers pulls that consent down to their other devices, which is very convenient for the user. Additionally, user content preferences are delivered through a Worker node closest to their geographic location, which dramatically speeds things up.\" \n\nWorkers now acts as OneTrust's serverless architecture. In addition to saving the company money and enabling it to build low-latency applications, Workers has improved internal development processes. \"Because Workers is a highly distributed architecture, I don't have to spend time with my team figuring out how to build features to be highly available. Our time to market has dramatically sped up, and we know that anything we code through Workers will meet our service-level agreements (SLA) for high availability.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare performance & security solutions are tightly integrated into OneTrust's SaaS platform__\n\nOneTrust uses Cloudflare products on approximately 33 top-level domains and about 16,000 subdomains, and the company just exceeded 2 petabytes of traffic a month served through the Cloudflare CDN. Thanks to Cloudflare SSL for SaaS, all OneTrust customers have the option of deploying a vanity domain.\n\n\"We've implemented Cloudflare's products across our business - from our core customer cloud product to our internal company apps and websites. Cloudflare is an integral part of OneTrust's privacy, security, and governance technology solution and helps us differentiate in the market.\"  -- Blake Brannon, CTO\n\nThe Cloudflare WAF blocks over 30 million threats a month for OneTrust. It also provides Brannon and his team with visibility into security threats and granular control over policies. \"The WAF is simple but very powerful. Some of our API calls are very open, and others are very restrictive. The WAF enables us to easily create very specific policies for individual pages within our app.\"\n\nOneTrust's cloud services bill would be much higher without Cloudflare. \"We have many large enterprise customers, so there's a huge amount of compute and performance on the server side, and demand is growing,\" he says. \"Thanks to Cloudflare's CDN, Rate Limiting, and traffic shielding, everything isn't coming back to our Azure account. In addition to saving money, we're able to scale globally while maintaining high performance and reliability.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Access enables seamless, secure connections to internal apps__\n\nPrior to implementing Access, OneTrust secured some of its internal apps using Azure AD with multi-factor authentication (MFA), and others through IP restrictions, a VPN, or both. Brannon did not want to depend on a VPN. It required users to be on-site, and all of the traffic from the VPN had to travel through its three corporate offices. \"We have 12 global offices, and all of that traffic coming back to our firewall/VPN system made zero sense. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic happened, and it made even less sense.\"\n\nAfter a successful pilot of Cloudflare Access in OneTrust's development environment, Brannon secured the remainder of OneTrust's internal environment behind Access. Now, all of the company's developers and testers use it, aout 550 people. Feedback from users has been overwhelmingly positive, and Access has improved OneTrust's security posture. \"In addition to integrating Access with our Azure AD infrastructure and MFA, all of our highly sensitive services, which require a hardware-generated certificate, are mapped back to our Access controls. Access greatly increased our security posture over VPN, which didn't even support MFA.\"\n\nAccess has also improved employee efficiency. \"Some of our users wanted to use mobile for virtual meetings, but our VPN didn't support it; Access does. Meetings go more smoothly because users don't experience latency issues that require them to disconnect and reconnect. That was a big problem with the VPN.\" \n\n### __Cloudflare enables OneTrust to focus on its core competency__\n\nWith Cloudflare solutions integrated into its IT infrastructure and customer application, OneTrust's developers are able to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on projects that further the organization's goals.\n\n\"OneTrust relies on Cloudflare to maintain our network perimeter, so we can focus on delivering technology that helps our customers be more trusted,\" Brannon adds. \"With Cloudflare, we can easily build context-aware Zero Trust policies for secure access to our developer tools. Employees can connect to the tools they need so simply teams don't even know Cloudflare is powering the backend. It just works.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## INSEAD uses Cloudflare's security solutions to secure their public and employee-facing websites and apps\n\nFounded in 1957, INSEAD is an international graduate business school with campuses in France, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi, with a San Francisco location coming soon. The school consistently ranks among the world's top business programs, and its nearly 60,000 alumni represent 175 countries and 166 nationalities.\n\n### __Challenge: Protect student-facing sites and apps from malicious threats and simplify remote login to employee apps__\n\nPrior to partnering with Cloudflare, INSEAD lacked a web application firewall (WAF) to protect both its WordPress websites and external applications like its payment gateway. \"We had an on-prem WAF for apps hosted on-prem, and for external apps, we relied on our app providers' security settings,\" explains Ar Kar Oo, Senior Manager, Cyber Security. \"We were struggling with malicious threats trying to execute JavaScript exploits, and we knew we needed a WAF to protect against these threats.\"\n\nInternal application access was also a challenge. INSEAD used a combination of VPNs and allow-listing to give developers access to these applications, which was complex and time-consuming to manage. INSEAD needed more flexibility than the VPN could provide, including the ability to deploy single sign-on (SSO) to simplify logins when developers  had different credentials for different environments.\n\n### __Cloudflare's WAF provides enhanced visibility into cyber threats__\n\nINSEAD partnered with Cloudflare in early 2020 and deployed the Cloudflare WAF as a small-scale proof of concept. When this proved successful, INSEAD began rolling out the Cloudflare WAF across all its websites and apps.\n\n\"We mostly use the WAF's preconfigured rules,\" Ar Kar Oo says. \"The configuration and implementation were very smooth. We only needed to contact Cloudflare a few times to get advice on configuring the rules and checking the logs. We like that once we configure the app for one site or app, we can use the same configuration for other sites and apps.\"\n\nThe Cloudflare's WAF now blocks approximately 100,000 threats a month from reaching INSEAD's web properties and applications, and the school benefits from the increased visibility the WAF provides. \"We didn't have detailed information on cyber threats and traffic levels before. Now, we can see exactly how cybercriminals are trying to access our sites,\" Ar Kar Oo says. \"Whenever a WAF rule is triggered, we know we need to investigate further. Also, DDoS attacks are picking up again, and having Cloudflare protecting our sites is a value-added benefit.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Access minimizes dependence on VPNs and allowlisting__\n\nINSEAD decided to deploy Cloudflare Access, which provides access control for cloud and on-premise applications without the need for a VPN, while its proof of concept for the WAF was still ongoing. \"We have a very large portfolio of apps, all of which would benefit greatly from the increased security and flexibility that Cloudflare Access can provide,\" says Alexandre Papadopoulos, Director of Cyber Security.\n\n\"We're also looking into expanding how we are using our environment,\" adds Ar Kar Oo. \"Most of our users are on mobile, and we want to use Access to accommodate them.\" \n\nBoth Papadopoulos and Ar Kar Oo found the implementation of Cloudflare WAF and CDN to be quite easy. The team was concerned about negatively impacting performance for China-based users, but these fears turned out to be unfounded. \"Our sites are very complex, so we are very cautious about implementing new solutions,\" Papadopoulos says. \nAccess has also improved internal efficiency. Prior to implementing Access, INSEAD's admins had to do a lot of location-based allowlisting, and if they wanted to make any changes to an app, they had to seek permissions, which created bottlenecks. \"Access lets us set up custom policies, and we've been able to reduce our dependence on VPNs and IP allow-listing for development environments. Additionally, our developers and testers aren't required to login from specific locations, and we've been able to deploy an SSO solution to simplify the login process,\" Papadopoulos recalls.\n\n\"Access is easier to manage than VPNs and other remote access solutions, which has removed pressure from our IT teams,\" Papadopoulos adds. \"They can focus on internal projects instead of spending time managing remote access.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare CDN serves terabytes of bandwidth each month__\n\nIn addition to Access and the Cloudflare WAF, INSEAD is also in the process of implementing the Cloudflare CDN. Currently, INSEAD serves about 1.5 terabytes of traffic a month through the CDN.\n\n\"I would definitely recommend Cloudflare to colleagues,\" says Ar Kar Oo. \"I'd used Cloudflare previously, but this was my first time using Access, and I quite like it.\"\n\n\"Everything has gone smoothly,\" adds Papadopoulos. \"Cloudflare's solutions are easy to deploy, they're user-friendly, and they immediately show value. Getting developers to buy into a security product can be tricky. Developers tend to view a new security solution as something that's going to add to their workload, but they had no resistance or complaints about Cloudflare. Access and Cloudflare WAF have made their jobs easier.\"",

For 12 years running, Australian consumers have voted Blackmores the country's Most Trusted Vitamin and Supplement Brand. Blackmores' extensive range of vitamins, minerals, and herbal and nutritional supplements are sold throughout Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.\n\n### __Challenge: Reduce complexity by implementing uniform technology organisation-wide__\n\nBlackmores IT operations were siloed. The BioCeuticals brand had its own IT team, which was using Cloudflare solutions, while the rest of the organisation was using a different a mix of technologies. Two years ago, Blackmores' IT teams were consolidated, and Andrew Grech was brought on as the company's Head of IT Digital.\n\nGrech immediately wanted to simplify IT operations by implementing uniform technology solutions company-wide. \n\n\"I examined how our BioCeuticals brand was using Cloudflare's solutions, and I realised they could be used throughout our environment,\" he recalls.   \"We wanted to enhance the reliability of our systems, minimize our costs, and have a central portal through which we could manage our IT environment,\" Andrew said.\n\nCloudflare Access enhances remote access security and eliminates the need for IP rulesets.\n\n### __Blackmores uses Cloudflare Access__\n\nBlackmores now uses a single sign-on (SSO) solution and Azure AD.   Blackmores also uses Access to protect all of its public-facing services. In combination with Cloudflare Page Rules, users can control how Cloudflare works on a URL or subdomain basis, to protect the administrative functions of these services.\n\n \"Access and Page Rules enable us to restrict functions to trusted users in trusted locations,\" Goddard explains. \"This makes it far easier for our employees and vendors to access the services they need, and we now have a completely secure environment. We no longer have to worry about whether a service is too open or too locked down.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers powers new customized subscription service__\n\nBlackmores is using Workers, Cloudflare's serverless development solution, for its new B(more) subscription service. People are asked questions about their health and wellbeing and receive recommendations for vitamin combinations that are customized to their specific needs. \"This technology enables us to provide a highly personalized online experience, that will ultimately enhance sales,\" Grech says.\n\n\"The B(more) project required Blackmores to serve and post content from two different environments, which had entirely different features and functionalities. Workers allows us to use different platforms to form the overall solution without having to do Git requests,\" Andrew said.\n\n### __Cloudflare WAF saves Blackmores money and provides complete visibility & control__\n\nPrior to implementing Cloudflare's WAF solution, Blackmores used the native security settings in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, as well as internal solutions. However, these tools didn't provide the team with sufficient visibility or control over firewall rules.\n\n\"Granular control over firewall rules is important to us,\" Goddard says. \n\n\"When a problem occurs, the WAF allows us to pinpoint where it's happening so that we can fix it. We can see the origins of all cyberattacks, not just DDoS. For example, if we're noticing an unusual increase in subscriptions or processes coming from a single origin, we can write rules to mitigate them.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare CDN and Argo Routing reduce complexity and improve performance__\n\nOverall, Blackmores' websites consist of about 60% static content and 40% dynamic content. Prior to implementing Cloudflare CDN, Blackmores delivered all of this directly from their origin servers. Caching static content through the CDN and delivering it as close as possible to each user has improved response times and load times.\n\nPairing the Cloudflare CDN with Argo Routing has improved overall page responsiveness and simplified developer processes by reducing complexity.

Oak's founding team had built careers in education as principals and teachers and when schools closed, they aspired \"to make sure no student missed a lesson during COVID-19.\" \n\nIn its first week, the team brought together volunteer teachers, developers, and designers to prepare over 250 video lessons. By the summer, Oak had delivered 20 million lessons, reached 4.7 million people, and secured £4.3 million in government funding to expand programming into the next academic year. Today, Oak offers nearly 10,000 lessons - all available for free - across diverse subjects for pupils ages 4-16.\n\nThe true heroes of this story are the educators, whose passion has fueled Oak's growth. But getting off the ground in April was technically daunting: The portal needed to be created within one week, in time for a government decision on a permanent transition to remote learning. With such a short turnaround, Oak needed technology that could keep pace with their ambitions and imagination.\n\n### __Securing access to Oak's pre-production environments__\nWith a few days until launch, Oak's team needed to test its initial Wordpress portal. To conduct QA, several volunteer developers needed access to certain pre-production environments. Meanwhile, volunteer teachers needed access to other pre-production environments, so that they could review and edit their lesson plans. \n\nCloudflare Access made it fast and simple to authenticate these different stakeholders into their respective environments. Developers and teachers already had a Google ID with Oak, and so, the IT team could create groups within Access and enable them to authenticate based on that identity provider. According to Technology Director John Roberts, implementing and scaling across the hundred of users took \"literally less than an hour.\" \n\n\"Using Google plus Access meant we didn't have to integrate with any identity services or build one ourselves,\" added Stef Lewandowski, Lead Developer. \"That could have taken weeks of work and implementation overhead.\"\n\nDuring a rebuild of the platform later in the summer, Oak stuck with Access to scale to the 900+ teachers who were creating new lessons for the fall.\n\n### __Fixing compliance overnight before launch__\nOn the night of the go-live, Roberts and Lewandowski had some outstanding tasks  in their final runbook. The Wordpress site was missing specific security headers that would be required for audits and to secure Oak's content. The oversight was potentially launch-threatening.\n\nIn response, Lewandoski created a Cloudflare Worker from scratch within 15 minutes to add those missing headers. \"It worked on the first try,\" said Lewandowski. \"And we went from an 'F rating' to an 'A rating' on the site.\" \n\nThis experience not only helped them sleep easy that night, but also showcased the power of serverless app development. Today, Oak runs more than 20 different Workers in production. One such Worker supports an internal search function, which Lewandowski noted \"delivers a massively improved user experience\" relative to analogous functions on competitors platforms.\n\n### __Protecting against threats on launch day and beyond__\nOn Sunday, April 19, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced Oak National Academy at the government's daily COVID briefing. The Oak team knew to expect significant attention, but was confident in Cloudflare's capabilities to manage traffic.\n\nSpecifically, Oak had cached their website heavily (about 97% of content) on Cloudflare's network, which reduced the load on Oak's servers substantially. Moreover, Oak locked down specific parts of Wordpress with some off-the-shelf and custom controls with Cloudflare's WAF and Page Rules.\n\n\"We were able to support 250 thousand users on day one,\" said Lewandowski. \"I don't think that would've been possible without Cloudflare, unless we had more substantial engineering resources.\"\n\nSince April, Oak has evolved its educational offerings and portal, even moving from Wordpress to React and Next.js. Through these changes, Cloudflare's network has helped the IT team absorb and face new threats, including a DDOS attack. Ultimately, as classes continue in remote and hybrid contexts, the goal remains ensuring that Oak is secure and reliable for the teachers and students who need it most. \n\n\"We've had a significant amount of press. We were announced on the podium at 10 Downing Street, and this made us a bigger target,\" said Roberts. \"We needed to make sure we had a best-in-class product to secure our site as we were building it so fast. Cloudflare has definitely achieved that and exceeded our expectations.\" ",

						"shortDescription": "Science Museum of Minnesota leveraged Cloudflare Access to transition to remote work overnight.",
						"longDescription": "## Faced with an overnight order to work remotely, the Science Museum of Minnesota used Cloudflare Access to keep employees connected to critical apps \nThe Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) is a treasure of the American Midwest and the global STEM community. Founded in 1907, SMM is one of the oldest natural history museums in the U.S. In a typical year, students across all of Minnesota's 87 counties engage with SMM, whether through class visits or educational outreach. Traveling exhibitions and partnerships with international museums extend SMM's influence to millions around the world.\n\nThe 370-thousand square foot museum, located along the Mississippi River in St. Paul, is physically a sight to behold. But as Infrastructure Developer Joel Miles noted, the museum has always been interested in \"taking the learning that happens within our physical space and sharing it outwards.\" As the COVID-19 pandemic required families to stay home this year, bringing the museum to life digitally became more and more important. \n\n### __Challenge: Transitioning to Google Cloud Platform__\nSMM envisions a world where \"everyone has the power to use science to make lives better.\" To realize that vision, SMM recognized that it needed to modernize its IT approach for the long-term. SMM's hardware was aging and required significant maintenance. So instead of incurring costs to replace its on-premise boxes, SMM migrated to Google Cloud Platform over the course of 2019, lifting and shifting all of its data and applications. \n\nAdopting GCP made sense given the organization's multi-year history using G-Suite. But configuring Google's Identity-Aware Proxy to secure access to applications was, according to Miles, more \"complex\" and \"required more tuning\" than anticipated. In particular, Miles was frustrated that certain certificate renewals recurred frequently and required his manual intervention.\n\n### __Cloudflare Access enables more seamless GCP implementation__\nThe museum's IT team is small and values simplicity above all else. Miles was motivated to get started with Cloudflare Access because of positive experiences with Cloudflare's other website products over the years. Cloudflare CDN has helped the museum save costs by offloading traffic, and the WAF has protected against prior targeted attacks. \n\nSo instead of investing time tinkering with the Google Identity-Aware Proxy and teaching his colleagues a new process, Miles turned to Access. He found that he could secure his applications faster and with less effort. \n\n\"It was ridiculously simple,\" he said. \"We put in our domain, set up the login page and service account, and it just worked.\"\n\nThe museum moved multiple Remote Desktop applications behind Access. From a remote desktop, employees reach their most critical business tools, such as the museum's CRM, general ledger, and purchase management system. All employees work in one or more of these tools over the course of a week. \n\nBut at least initially in 2019, the Museum had only rolled Access out to a subset of the organization. Most employees accessed these systems from within the office, while the handful of colleagues working from home could use a pre-existing VPN.\n\n### __Remote work transition proves a turning point__\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced the museum to devise and implement a remote work strategy practically overnight. The thought of scaling the VPN to over 350 employees gave Miles \"shivers.\" Instead, he committed to expanding Cloudflare Access across the whole organization and standardized his colleagues' login experience.\n\nSince the pandemic, SMM has put new applications behind Access in addition to the remote desktop. One such tool was a developer site that helped the museum shift its educational programming online, including experiments that families can do at home and materials for other science teachers. More broadly, Access is now protecting several administrator login pages that support development, testing, and staging for the museum's main website. These pages have long been popular attack targets for automated bots.\n\nAcross these varied tools, Access enables the museum to deliver a frictionless login experience. All museum employees are already logged into web browsers with their Google IDs, which is compatible with Access' Multi-SSO capabilities. So when employees reach applications protected by Access, they are already authenticated.\n\n\"People connect seamlessly, so nobody ever sees that Access is in front of it, which is beautiful,\" Miles said. \"They just connect to a page, login with their credentials, and they're running apps on a browser that they would have been running locally previously.\"\n\nThe Science Museum is open now with new safety protocols and scaled down hours and is planning a wider reopening pending government guidance. Going forward, the museum's simplified technology infrastructure enables staff to spend less time on maintenance and more time designing new experiences for patrons, including highly sought-after online offerings. For Miles, this \"low-to-no-maintenance\" approach helps the museum focus on its \"reason for being, which is science!\"\n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare's performance and security solutions enable Naranja to confidently move forward with its digital transformation and cloud migration.",
						"longDescription": "## Cloudflare security and performance solutions provide a solid foundation for  Naranja's digital transformation\n\nFounded in 1985, Naranja is Argentina's largest credit card issuer, with over six million customers. The bank, which primarily services consumers, also offers loans and insurance products through 200 branches and commercial offices covering all provinces in the country. \n\n### __Challenge: Migrate to the cloud while avoiding vendor lock-in__\n\nNaranja had been running legacy infrastructure from two on-prem data centers, but over the past three years, it has experienced tremendous growth. The company needed scalability, flexibility, and the ability to implement modern technologies, such as smart analytics, mobility, and contactless payment so that it could continue providing valuable consumer solutions while simultaneously enhancing its value proposition. On-prem infrastructure was no longer meeting Naranja's needs.\n\nThe company embarked on a company-wide digital transformation project that involved moving all of its systems and data to the cloud. The company's leadership did not want to be tied down to any particular cloud vendor; they wanted to build a multi-cloud environment that would give them the flexibility to run the right workloads, in the right place, at the right time. They decided to move most of their workloads to AWS and put some of them in Microsoft Azure.\n\nNaranja's next step was to select a cloud-hosted solution that would enable them to maximize the security of their AWS and Azure environments while achieving maximum performance and value.\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare's performance and security solutions enhance performance, improve visibility into security issues, and block threats__\n\nAfter evaluating a number of performance and security solutions from a variety of vendors, Naranja chose Cloudflare. They liked that Cloudflare's solutions were cloud host-agnostic and cloud-native, and they appreciated that Cloudflare had a local presence in Argentina, which meant that their team could work closely with Cloudflare's engineers throughout their cloud migration process. \n\n\"We see Cloudflare as a valuable entry point to the cloud,\" explains Gabriel Balastegui, Cloud Networking Engineer. \"Cloudflare is our first line of security perimeter defense. They're a key partner that allows Naranja to run workloads in the cloud of our choice, as we see best.\"\n\nNaranja first implemented Cloudflare DNS and Load Balancer, later adding Page Rules, WAF, rate limiting, and CDN. The Cloudflare global network reduced egress traffic to its AWS deployment by 80%, which resulted in significant cost savings, as well as enhanced reliability and fewer outages. \n\n\"We've seen some of the greatest tangible benefits from the Cloudflare network,\" Balastegui says, \"but perhaps the greatest tangible benefit is the visibility Cloudflare gives us into our traffic, security policies, and security incidents. We had some visibility before, when we were running on-prem solutions, but Cloudflare has considerably improved it.\"\n\nBalastegui reports a very positive experience with Cloudflare's security suite. In one 72-hour period, Cloudflare WAF blocked over 730,000 attempted attacks across five highly trafficked domains. \"We value the visibility and threat mitigation that Cloudflare provides. The user interface is very user-friendly. We have WAF turned on at a very high level and are using most of the features of the firewall rules. We use them quite a bit for geo-blocking, so that we can block traffic from countries that do not have AWS instances. It's been extremely useful in finding issues at the app level, which allows us to modify the code and mitigate them.\" Tarjeta Naranja is also in the process of integrating Cloudflare's security logs with its Splunk deployment.\n\nCloudflare has also enabled Naranja to automate IaaS deployment and configuration by using Cloudflare APIs with platforms such as Terraform. When the company originally implemented Cloudflare's solutions, they used Cloudflare's DNS service in a C-NAME configuration on their most critical domain. \"Over time, we gained a lot of confidence in Cloudflare's solutions, and we're looking to migrate this domain to a full setup going forward,\" says Balastegui.\n\nNaranja is also very satisfied with Cloudflare Argo. After using Argo Smart Routing, they saw a 20% to 30% improvement in load times. Currently, Naranja is starting to use Argo Tunnel and is moving more of its on-prem workloads to Cloudflare to obtain greater visibility and enhance the security of its legacy apps. They are also testing using Argo Tunnel as an intermediate connectivity layer with their VPN and WAN to connect their datacenter with their cloud instances, and they are performing testing on planned use cases for Cloudflare Workers, including header manipulation.\n",

						"shortDescription": "By consolidating performance and security under Cloudflare, Chrono24 is saving money and enjoying superior performance, customer service, and visibility into security threats.",
						"longDescription": "## Chrono24 saves money, accelerates website performance & improves security by consolidating under Cloudflare \n\nSince 2003, Chrono24 has run one of the world's largest online marketplaces for luxury watches. The company's mobile apps have over 5 million users. The Chrono24 desktop marketplace, which is accessible from 46 regionalized top-level domains, offers content in 22 languages and attracts over half a million visitors daily. On an average day, these visitors can browse over 475,000 luxury watches listed for sale by more than 3,000 professional dealers and private sellers from over 120 countries.\n\n### __Challenge: Poor performance and subpar service from previous performance & security vendors__\n\nPrior to partnering with Cloudflare, Chrono24 subscribed to a content delivery network (CDN) solution from EdgeCast and purchased DDoS mitigation and a web application firewall (WAF) from another vendor. \n\nThe CDN performed poorly, especially for users in Japan and Australia, who experienced significant latency. Chrono24 was also unsatisfied with their security vendor's performance and customer service. Both products slowed down Chrono24's site and app, and Sven Ferber, Director of Technology, did not find the vendor's analytics helpful in monitoring or mitigating threats.\n\n\"Their customer service reps weren't helpful at all when we had issues, which happened frequently. They kept telling us the problem was on our end, when it was actually their product causing the issues,\" Ferber recalls. \"Additionally, the statistics and insights they provided were of very poor quality. We had zero transparency into security threats or attacks.\" \n\nFerber also felt that having two vendors was too costly. He decided to consolidate performance and security under one vendor that could provide a fast, reliable CDN, a WAF, and DDoS mitigation to secure and accelerate its website and mobile apps. \n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare offers superior performance & service while consolidating solutions__\n\nFerber chose Cloudflare's core performance and security package, which included Cloudflare's globally distributed CDN, WAF, and DDoS mitigation services. He was immediately impressed with Cloudflare's customer service and the ease of use.\n\n\"Setting up our Cloudflare solutions wasn't complex at all,\" he recalls. \"Cloudflare provided us with plenty of documentation and support during the onboarding phase. Compared to our past experiences, deployment was extremely straightforward. Cloudflare's solution engineers used our data from our previous vendor to set up our CDN, and that has worked out really well for us. We had some questions regarding the details of the WAF. We weren't sure what effect they'd have on our site, but Cloudflare's engineers explained everything to us, and the outcome was great.\"\n\n\"Cloudflare's standard rules block the overwhelming majority of threats,\" he continues. \"It was easy for us to set up custom WAF rules for the few threats that Cloudflare doesn't catch.\"\n\nAfter deploying Cloudflare, Chrono24 saw an immediate increase in site speed. \"All of our sites got faster worldwide, but the improvement was especially noticeable in Japan and Australia, because that's where we'd been having the biggest problems,\" Ferber explains. \"Site speed in Japan increased by 35% year over year. Average page download time before Cloudflare was 4.2 seconds; now, it's 2 seconds.\"\n\nFerber was just as pleased with Cloudflare's WAF and DDoS protection. Cloudflare blocks approximately 1.4 million threats each month, and Ferber and his team can access insightful, actionable security analytics. \"Cloudflare has made our cybersecurity much more manageable,\" he says. \"Previously, we lacked visibility into potential threats. Cloudflare's security analytics dashboard gives us full transparency. We can see every security threat to our sites and app.\"\n\nIn addition to performance and security improvements, Cloudflare is saving Chrono24 money. \"Our base cost is much lower now that we've consolidated performance and security under one provider. I estimate we're spending about one-third as much,\" Ferber reports.\n\nFerber is also highly impressed with Cloudflare's customer service. \"We've been Cloudflare customers for about nine months now, and we haven't needed to request support since we first set everything up. That's phenomenal; it definitely speaks to quality of service and ease of use. Even if a company has great customer support, it's not good if we have to call them all the time because we're having issues.\"\n\n\"Working with Cloudflare has been a great experience,\" he continues. \"They absolutely met our expectations regarding performance, security, and customer support. It's been a huge financial and logistical advantage for Chrono24 to have all of our security and performance needs delivered by one vendor, on one infrastructure. If we need more security and performance services, we'll definitely turn to Cloudflare.\"\n\nIn fact, Ferber envisions expanding his Cloudflare security portfolio in the near future. \"DDoS attacks used to be our biggest security issue, but now, it's malicious bots, so we're in discussions with Cloudflare regarding implementing their bot management solution.\"",

						"longDescription": "## Waseda University realized stable web service even during cyberattacks with maintenance-free and cost effective Cloudflare WAF service\n\nWaseda University, which will celebrate the 150th anniversary of its founding in 2032, formulated the \"WASEDA VISION 150\" as its medium-and-long-term plan to build a firm position as one of Asia's most prestigious universities. To realize this plan, the University's IT Strategies Division determines goals and measures to be achieved by maximizing the value of computerization, by accelerating implementation of all measures such as migration to the cloud, and by strengthening security measures.\n\n### __The Situation and Challenge__\n\n\"Waseda University's Information Planning Department has stipulated management reforms, collaboration enhancement, disaster control measures, and security as our top priorities, which makes having consistently reliable, high-performing websites and applications essential,\" stated Tomohiro Takahashi, Associate Administrative Director, IT Strategies Division Administrative Director, IT Strategies Section.\n\n__Complicated on-premise management in rapidly changing environment and high workloads under cyberattacks__\n\nThe amount of peak web traffic increases year by year as Waseda University hosts significant events such as university admissions tests or open campus sessions. In the past, Waseda's website, built on on-premise solutions, has experienced random DDoS attacks causing visitors to complain about slow response times. To investigate the root cause and resolve the issue, IT staff was forced to work late into the night or on weekends. Not only was development cost high, but also server sizing was very difficult since there was a big gap of server load between normal access and peek access. Disaster control measures were also urgently needed since all facilities were provided on-premise and would be unable to keep serving when damaged by disasters such as earthquakes. Waseda University's team came to believe that new services qualified with customer requirements could be quickly and more cost-effectively developed using a cloud or managed service as a replacement to its existing on-premise approach.\n\n### __Reasons for Selection__\n__Fully integrated, rich feature set on a massive platform__\n\n\"Cloudflare delivers all the functionality on one, integrated platform and covers everything we want to do,\" said Tomohiro Takahashi. Cloudflare's network spans more than 200 cities in over 100 countries, including 16 cities in mainland China, and Cloudflare delivers all functions on each point-of-presence (PoP) including CDN (Content Delivery Network), WAF (Web Application Firewall), DDoS mitigation and Bot mitigation. As a result, the Cloudflare network handles user traffic quickly and securely and, in addition, customers can easily configure, manage and use all functionalities as a service. As Waseda University also accepts students from overseas, it was necessary to deliver stable web services to China users as well.\n\n__Simple pricing structure and flat rate__\n\nCloudflare pricing is mainly based on\nthe total amount of traffic and number of target\nTLDs (Top Level Domains) such as '.jp' or '.com'. This contrasts with other CDN vendors whose price is based on number of target subdomains, not TLDs. \"Budgeting is difficult for us, since the University has all kinds of education and research projects which effect website utilization and can increase or decrease the number of subdomains accordingly. Cloudflare's pricing structure is very simple, allowing us to plan a budget with peace of mind,\" continued Tomohiro Takahashi. In addition, when a customer is attacked by DDoS, other vendors may charge for attack traffic. Cloudflare does not charge for such burst traffic as its service is provided at a flat rate.\n\n__Everything we need is offered as an all-in-one package at low cost__\n\n\"We compared several CDN vendors as part of a multi-phased vendor selection process. Cloudflare has launched new and exciting features one after another and is an influential vendor. Cloudflare's partner, GlobalDots, offered a service which can store and analyze raw data for more than 3 months. We were convinced that by selecting Cloudflare and GlobalDots, we would be able to deliver our required functionalities, including operation and incident support and long-term log analyzing as an all-in-one package,\" explained Hitoshi Kusunoki, Project Leader, IT Strategies Division at Waseda University.\n\n### __Cloudflare Solutions__\n__Service stability and easier operations__\n\n\"The production phase started a few months after the trial. To avoid a false positive, we used simulation functionality included in WAF policy options to check the behavior of the new WAF policy with actual traffic. WAF policies are provided by default and we found them very easy to configure. If we need a custom signature, as soon as we send a request from the platform, it will be reflected on the platform by Cloudflare and can be operated almost maintenance-free. In the past, there were inquiries from users that web access was extremely slow at large events such as open campus. However, we never heard such complaints again after Cloudflare was installed,\" explained Hitoshi Kusunoki. \"By using Cloudflare, service stability has been strengthened and operations have become much easier,\" concluded Tomohiro Takahashi.\n\n### __Expectation for Cloudflare__\n\n\"The initial target scope of Cloudflare was 2 websites: the main website of Waseda University that has the greatest user access, and the website used by the University's Information Planning Department. With the success of the initial implementations, the scope has been expanded to other websites including the University's Learning Management System (LMS). GlobalDots will optimize WAF policies for LMS website protection. We considered adding more servers to handle the ever-increasing number of user access requests. With Cloudflare, however, we could reduce the server usage to almost half. As the result, further cost reduction could be expected,\" mentioned Hitoshi Kusunoki.\n\nIn addition, as the next stage of migrating web servers to the cloud, Waseda University is planning to take measures to reduce disasters across the entire system by utilizing Cloudflare's DNS Firewall. The authoritative DNS servers that hold the actual DNS records of main web servers are currently running on an on-premise environment, and it is difficult to move to a cloud model without service impact. Cloudflare DNS firewall caches the DNS response from the authoritative DNS servers, and if an authoritative DNS server goes down, the DNS firewall continues to provide DNS service by using the cached response until the DNS server comes back online.\n\n\"Cloudflare has launched one innovation after another such as Cloudflare Access, which allows students or professors to securely access internal web resources such as the intranet without an agent. Or Cloudflare Magic Transit, which distributes the global IP address pool held by Waseda University via BGP and provides cyberattack protection for on-premise and cloud platforms. We look forward to hearing of more Cloudflare innovations and new solutions to come.\" concludes Hitoshi Kusunoki.",

Cloudflare is essential to handling that sort of bandwidth while maintaining security.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Access enables easier & far more secure remote access to internal apps__\n\nAs the company rapidly expanded, took on more employees, and outsourced more work to third-party developers, IT administrators had to find a better way of authenticating users and tracking app usage. \n\nTo improve security and efficiency, Canva adopted Cloudflare Access, which provides [secure access to internal applications](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) After a successful pilot with CanvaWorld, an internal social media platform, Canva expanded their Access usage to their internal testing and front-end development workflow. \"We went all-in, everyone in the company has an Access seat,\" Tyrrell says. \n\nIn addition to eliminating inefficiencies caused by shared passwords, Cloudflare Access has greatly improved the security of Canva's internal apps. \"Cloudflare Access saved us from having to develop our own Identity and Access Management (IAM) system,\" Tyrrell says. \"We also don't have to build user permission functions into the apps that Access protects. For example, we wanted to give employees different levels of permissions in CanvaWorld, and Access lets us do that easily.\" Access also makes employee and contractor onboarding and offboarding easier and more secure. \"As people come and go, we can just add and remove them. We don't have to change a common password, then save it in a file, then notify everyone.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Workers helps Canva with SEO optimization, A/B testing & more__\n\nWhen Cloudflare launched Workers, a serverless computing platform that runs on Cloudflare's edge network, Canva eagerly signed up. \"We were using another vendor's solution to run custom code at the network edge, and it was hard to manage,\" Tyrrell recalls. \n\nCanva initially used Workers to work around an upstream provider's limitations on blob storage. Workers allowed Canva to add a header that would allow the browser to not load the image and poison the cache. Tyrrell says, \"Our use of Workers has greatly expanded, and it's now become a critical part of our software. Workers performs a lot of key functions for our app, and we're looking into more potential uses right now.\"\n\nAmong Canva's current and planned use cases for Workers:\n\n- SEO optimization. \"Google penalizes websites for slowness, especially on mobile,\" Tyrrell points out. \"Workers help us ensure we can serve a cached version of certain pages based on the device.\"\n- Time-limiting access to visual content. \"We use signed URLs to give time-limited access to media and images,\" Tyrrell explains, \"but signed URLs are hard to cache because the parameters change based on the media's expiration time. We're exploring how Workers can still cache that media at the edge and get the security benefits of time-limited access, but without having to refetch that image back to the origin.\"\n\nThe Canva team likes Workers' flexibility and ease of use, and the company enjoys time and cost savings from using Workers. \"If we had to manage our own proxy servers end-to-end, it would cost us a lot of time and money.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare Bot Management stops cyberattacks by image-scraping bots__\n\nWith millions of images, plus additional video and audio content, Canva is a frequent target of image-scraping bots. \"Our content partners would contact us and report that they'd found their images on another site, which would make them very upset,\" Tyrrell recalls.\n\nCanva tried to solve the problem by throttling malicious IP addresses and using client heuristics, neither of which were effective. Then, Canva deployed Cloudflare's Bot Management solution and saw immediate results. \"When we deployed Bot Management, a large proportion of traffic just dropped, and we knew it wasn't legitimate traffic,\" says Tyrrell. We didn't have the capacity to build out our own solution. Cloudflare Bot Management helped us get a handle on the problem.\"\n\n### __Next up for Canva: additional collaborative tools & mobile__\n\nCanva is continuously investing in its platform's collaborative capabilities. \"Enabling remote collaboration is a big priority post COVID-19,\" Tyrrell says. Mobile is another area of focus for Canva, especially as it penetrates developing markets where most people rely on mobile devices. \"We're already using Cloudflare's image resizing tool for mobile optimization. It resizes images on the fly depending on the end user's device size, which enhances performance and reduces our storage and bandwidth costs.\"\n\nCloudflare's solutions play a major role in Canva's long-term plans. \"As our business grows, and we expand our product offerings, such as Canva for Enterprise, we expect to run into new technical challenges,\" Tyrrell explains. \"Just as Canva simplifies graphic design, Cloudflare simplifies performance and security. Thanks to Cloudflare, we can focus on improving our product and expanding into new markets with confidence, knowing that our platform is fast, reliable, and secure.\"",

						"shortDescription": "Kathmandu's engineering team protects its site and internal applications partnering with Cloudflare for access management, WAF, and serverless computing.",
						"longDescription": "## Cloudflare's access management, security, and serverless solutions minimize administrative burdens for Kathmandu's engineering team \n\nBased in Christchurch, New Zealand, Kathmandu is an international retailer of apparel and equipment for travel and outdoor activities. \"Our products enable people to travel the world and be fully equipped for outdoor experiences,\" explains James Deane, Web Development Manager. Kathmandu ships to 130 countries and serves an extremely diverse customer base, ranging from urban adventurers to outdoor explorers to globetrotting travelers, and everyone in between. In the Fall of 2019, Kathmandu acquired Rip Curl, a world-renowned Australian surfing products brand, bolstering Kathmandu's value to about $1 billion.\n\n### __Challenge: Replace an unwieldy performance & security platform__\n\nPrior to partnering with Cloudflare, Kathmandu used Akamai's performance and security services. \"It was very difficult to use,\" Deane recalls. \"I have a small engineering team. We have a million things to do. We don't have time for an overly complex performance platform.\" Kathmandu also needed additional [protection from specific cyberthreats](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/). \"Online retailers are huge targets for cybercrime, especially retailers like us, who use the Magento platform. There are organized cybercrime groups that are dedicated to attacking Magento stores.\"\n\nAfter comparing several vendors, Kathmandu chose Cloudflare due to its feature set, capabilities, and usability. \"Cloudflare was an obvious choice for us because it served all of our needs and more, without adding complexity.\" Kathmandu signed up for Cloudflare's core security and performance suite, which includes the Cloudflare CDN and WAF. Later, the company added Cloudflare Access and Workers.\n\n### __Cloudflare Access secures access to internal apps without adding complexity__\n\nPrior to partnering with Cloudflare, Kathmandu used HTTP authentication to secure access to some internal apps, and Azure AD for others. Unfortunately, HTTP authentication has security gaps; login credentials are not encrypted, leaving them dangerously exposed. Azure AD proved difficult to extend to internal apps and external contract users. \"We wanted the ability to give partners access to our apps without all of the configuration work Azure AD required, touching servers, managing config files. Cloudflare Access integrates with Azure AD to abstract all of that complexity to the edge,\" Deane recalls.\n\nDeane decided to pilot Cloudflare Access on Kathmandu's development and test applications. \"That was a small but critically important use case,\" he explains. \"We have partners around the world. One of our primary development partners is based in Belarus. Secure global accessibility to our dev/test environment is super important.\"\n\nThe pilot took only 30 minutes to set up, from start to finish, and end users reacted very favorably. Based on this success, Deane began rolling out Access to the remainder of the company. Today, partners, remote workers, and on-site office workers use Access to authenticate. \"Our employees and partners rave about how seamless Access is compared to Azure AD. Our users range from hardcore techies to laypeople. Ensuring security without making things too hard for non-technical users is challenging. Our information security manager loves how Access balances security and usability.\"\n\nDeane is currently exploring how to use Access to protect Kathmandu's backend systems. \"Magento is the key to the kingdom for an ecommerce business. We process tens of millions of dollars of transactions for millions of customers. We're working on integrating Access with single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and Azure AD.\"\n\n### __Cloudflare WAF provides visibility and enhances security & performance__\n\nThe WAF played a key role in Kathmandu's decision to partner with Cloudflare. \"Ultimately, everything comes down to the security posture of our platform,\" Deane says.\n\nKathmandu was especially eager to filter out bot traffic. On an average day, Kathmandu's flagship Australian [ecommerce site](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) attracts several thousand of these malicious requests. \"One of our biggest problems is when bots attack a dynamic section of the site, such as a product page or the checkout page. Because those pages aren't cached, every request hits the database. Under a flood of requests, the database will fail, the site will be inoperable, and customers can't transact\" Deane explains.\n\nThe Cloudflare WAF has resolved this issue. In mid-August, Kathmandu's site was bombarded with 29 million requests from the same IP address. \"The WAF's automated blocking took care of it, and my team was able to place an additional IP block just in case anything managed to slip through,\" Deane recalls. \"The visibility that WAF gives us makes a huge difference. Anyone on my team can access the WAF portal and view what's going on at any given moment, we can see what's going on and immediately react to it.\"\n\nDeane's team finds the WAF extremely easy to configure and manage, even when writing custom firewall rules. \"The automated rules take care of the majority of our needs, but it's great to have the flexibility to write custom rules. For example, the WAF analytics helped us identify a lot of bad requests hitting the Australian site from visitors outside of Australia, so we configured a geo-based challenge to filter out human users from bots.\"\n\nBy blocking bad requests, Cloudflare WAF ensures that Kathmandu's sites remain available and operable for legitimate customers. With the WAF blocking bad bots, and the Cloudflare CDN delivering content at the network edge, close to users, Kathmandu's sites are able to weather traffic spikes. \"Because we sell outdoor clothing and equipment, we run extremely seasonal marketing campaigns that result in traffic levels at five to 10 times normal,\" Deane reports. \"The resiliency that Cloudflare gives us makes a massive difference.\"\n\n### __Next, Kathmandu will use Cloudflare Workers to abstract away complexity__\n\nMoving forward, Deane has big plans for Workers, Cloudflare's serverless platform. \"The development experience in Workers is fantastic. It's very straightforward and really well put together. Going from zero to having something up takes literally seconds. It's great to have this resource available; Workers is going to make a massive difference for us.\"\n\nDeane plans to use Workers to build an enhanced brick-and-mortar store locator for Kathmandu's websites, as well as to find ways to abstract away Magento's complexity. \"We're examining where serverless could drive efficiency. Anywhere we can decouple from Magento is great, and I know that serverless far outstrips what we can do with Magento.\"\n\nDeane reports that he wouldn't hesitate to recommend Cloudflare to a colleague. \"Whether you're a small business or a large enterprise, using Cloudflare is a no-brainer. I can't think of a single reason why any business shouldn't use Cloudflare.\"\n\nRead more about the Kathmandu + Rip Curl acquisition [here](https://www.ripcurl.com/us/blog/rip-curl-founders-sell-iconic-surf-brand-to-outdoor-specialists-kathmandu.html)",

						"longDescription": "## Cloudflare Access & Cloudflare Workers Enable TOPdesk's Global Expansion\n\nTOPdesk's cloud-based enterprise service management solution helps service-focused departments within organizations enhance efficiency and offer better service to internal and external end-customers. Using the TOPdesk application, service desk teams can manage incidents, create workflows, keep track of configurations, and gain visibility into the types of problems their users face. The platform enables real-time [monitoring](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/) of current support requests, secure sharing of requests among support team members, and storage of historical data.\n\nFrom its 15 worldwide office locations, over 750 TOPdesk employees help companies support more than 10 million end users.\n\n\"TOPdesk has been around for over 25 years, and we are experts in service management,\" says Sybren van Wijk, Technical Product Owner. \"We go beyond delivering a software product, to help our customers excel in service management.\"\n\n### __Challenge: Efficiently scale to support rapid global expansion__\n\nTOPdesk's application was sold exclusively as desktop software until 2003, when the company began providing it as a SaaS solution. The switch was very successful and led to significant customer growth, including expansion into international markets. \n\nHowever, as its customer base grew, the way in which TOPdesk supported its own customers needed to evolve. \"Whenever we enter a new country, the TOPdesk application is used in a different way, and it must comply with different data privacy and security requirements,\" van Wijk explains. \"More international customers meant more complex challenges for our customer support representatives.\"\n\nTOPdesk customers are required to opt in to allow TOPdesk representatives to access their environments remotely and assist with problems or questions. TOPdesk representatives did this using an internally designed application that was originally configured to be accessible from TOPdesk office locations only. It was also designed when the company had a simpler product and a much smaller customer base. As TOPDesk embraced a 24x7, global business model, support representatives encountered performance issues that inhibited their ability to assist customers.\n\n\"Going global while maintaining our high standards of performance and dependability was challenging,\" van Wijk recalls. \"We needed to fix our underlying infrastructure so that we could continue delivering on our core value.\"\n\nTOPdesk needed a new solution that would scale well and give customer support representatives always-on access to the support tool. The solution also needed to accommodate GDPR compliance regulations, which mandate that TOPdesk employees be able to access only the information customers permit them to, and no more.\n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare Access & Cloudflare Workers lay the foundation for TOPdesk's global expansion__\n\nAt the time, TOPdesk was already using Cloudflare SSL for SaaS, Argo, and Workers. \"Workers is the basic layer that makes our SaaS infrastructure multi-tenant,\" explains van Wijk. \"We ran into problems when we started scaling more customers on our SaaS platform; our internal codebase could not keep up. Workers greatly improved performance and enabled our app to seamlessly scale from hundreds of customers to thousands and beyond. Since installing Workers, traffic to the app has doubled, but performance has remained the same.\" \n\nHis previous success with Cloudflare solutions prompted van Wijk to use Cloudflare Access to solve the issues that his support representatives were facing. Specifically, putting Access in front of the internal customer support application would allow TOPdesk's support technicians to securely access the platform at any time, from any location.\n\nTopDesk first used Access to connect a small group of developers to internal dashboards that were previously accessible only behind a VPN. \"We had a very small number of colleagues who needed to work from home even before the pandemic,\" recalls van Wijk. \"Access made it much easier and faster for them to access dashboards and information. We quickly became confident that Access was the way to go forward, and we decided to switch our customer support application to Access.\"\n\nBy authenticating employee login requests at the edge before the request even reaches Workers, Access allows TOPdesk to keep their Workers codebase lightweight. \"Access makes sure that any employee who is trying to enter a customer's environment is authorized to do so. We don't have to write any code in Workers to ensure that the login request is valid; Access already does that.\"\n\nIn a twist of fate, van Wijk decided to add additional Access seats about a week prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. When TOPdesk's employees had to be sent home to work, the company was ready. \"All of our customer support personnel and all of our SaaS engineers were already using Access, so there were no changes in how they had to work.\"\n\nTOPdesk's developers enjoyed similar flexibility. \"Having our developers work remotely wasn't our primary goal at the outset, but when everyone had to go work at home, it really helped that they didn't have to fight with remote login solutions just to access some information.\"\n\n\"We were already happy with Cloudflare Access before COVID-19, and it ended up being a big save when our team had to work remotely,\" van Wijk continues. \"Because our employees didn't have to struggle with apps that weren't designed for remote access, our platform kept running smoothly, and our customer base experienced no interruptions in support. We've had an all-around amazing experience with Cloudflare. Their ease of use and onboarding has been phenomenal compared to our other vendors, and they are enabling us to scale confidently and securely.\"",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare Magic Transit got Wikimedia's network back online after a massive DDoS attack, and it continues to safeguard the security and reliability of their data centers.",
						"longDescription": "## Cloudflare Magic Transit Gets Wikimedia Back Online After Massive DDoS Attack\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates Wikipedia and a range of other free knowledge projects, including Wikimedia Commons, Wikiquote, and Wiktionary. The Foundation is committed to free knowledge, and its vision is to create a world in which all people can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. \n\nWhile these projects are run by a global community of volunteers, the Foundation's staff maintains these projects' technology backbone, advocates for policies and protections that support free knowledge, and supports volunteers in their efforts to capture knowledge across languages, cultures, and continents.\n\n__Challenge: Halt a massive DDoS attack that took Wikimedia sites offline worldwide__\n\n\"Wikimedia wants to become the essential infrastructure of the ecosystem of free knowledge,\" explains Grant Ingersoll, CTO of the Wikimedia Foundation. \"We want everyone to be able to access our content, use and incorporate it into their lives, enrich their lives, and help build a better internet.\"\n\nAchieving this goal means Wikimedia's sites must be reliable, secure and fast. \"The volunteers who create and edit all of our content can't do their work if our sites aren't accessible, or they're hard to use, or they're being vandalized by bots,\" says Faidon Liambotis, Director of Site Reliability Engineering. \"I want my team to be able to sleep at night, confident that all of our websites are working.\"\n\nOn the security front, Wikimedia had not suffered a large DDoS attack for several years. Unfortunately, the organization's luck ran out on September 7, 2019, when a massive attack rendered its sites inaccessible—first in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, and then in other parts of the world, including the U.S. and Asia. \"At the attack's peak, it was hundreds of Gbps,\" recalls Chris Danis, Staff Site Reliability Engineer.\n\nDuring the initial hours of the outage, Wikimedia's team tried unsuccessfully to stop the attacks and get its sites back online. \"We attempted several mitigations that involved remapping our GeoDNS-based load balancing, and tried some traffic engineering measures when traffic was entering via our peering links,\" explains Danis. \n\n__Solution: Wikimedia uses Magic Transit to get back online quickly__\n\nCloudflare reached out to Wikimedia and offered to assist using Magic Transit, a solution that protects network infrastructure. Liambotis recalls that they reached out immediately at the time of the attack, even though it was Friday evening at the time. \"When the team contacted us, they already knew what was going on.\" he says.\n\n\"I think Cloudflare's security operations center and threat intelligence team already knew the attack signature—TCP ACK from port 65535 —before we asked them for anything,\" adds Danis. \"Cloudflare quoted us attack estimates that were significantly more than what we were able to measure. Once Magic Transit was turned on, Cloudflare measured the attack (at different points, in different units) at ~300Gbps of bandwidth, 105MPPS of TCP ACK traffic, and 340MPPS of UDP floods.\"\n\nLiambotis reports that with Magic Transit, his team was able to stop the attack by making the necessary changes in their routing policies. \"However,\" he notes, \"This is a simplification. The attack was on and off, changing patterns. Magic Transit resolved the problem, even as the attack moved.\"\n\n__Results & Benefits: Magic Transit Is an Essential Piece of Wikimedia's DDoS Defense Strategy__\n\nWikimedia continues to use Magic Transit to mitigate DDoS attacks. Liambotis appreciates that the tool can be turned on and off as needed. \"Being able to turn off Cloudflare's announcements of our IP space gives us options in the event that something goes wrong.\"\n\nMagic Transit also does not interfere with the existing end-to-end encryption between Wikimedia projects and their users, even when it is active. This, in addition to its technical capabilities, made Magic Transit the right choice for the team. \"We appreciated Cloudflare's responsiveness to our security and privacy needs. As an organization, we are very sensitive to privacy concerns.\"\n\nWikimedia also appreciates that Magic Transit filters traffic at the network edge instead of diverting it to a centralized scrubbing center, as some cloud \"scrubbing\" vendors do. Other options use a more centralized architecture,\" Liambotis says. \"They don't filter at the edge but in a few distant scrubbing centers, so they didn't meet our requirements for capacity and capabilities. If they had a problem in one of their scrubbing centers, and our traffic got diverted there, we'd end up with latency problems.\"\n\n\"The routing changes required to enable a centralized scrubbing center affect both user latency and also time-to-mitigate,\" Danis adds. \"Filtering globally at the edge, like Magic Transit does, saves on latency for legitimate traffic.\"\n\n\"From an infrastructure risk perspective, DDoS is very high on our list,\" Liambotis says, \"and Cloudflare Magic Transit is foundational to our DDoS mitigation strategy.\"\n\nThe Wikimedia team continues to be impressed with Cloudflare's responsiveness when issues arise. \"We've had to interact with Cloudflare's team on a few different occasions since deploying Magic Transit, including a tricky issue involving routing loops within parts of Cloudflare's network,\" Danis recalls. \"We've been impressed with their speed of response and technical competency.\"\n\n\"Cloudflare has reliable infrastructure and an extremely competent and responsive team. They are well-positioned to deflect even the largest of attacks,\" adds Ingersoll.",

						"shortDescription": "Ecommerce platform Trendyol used Cloudflare to block hundreds of millions of malicious requests without impacting site performance.",
						"longDescription": "## Trendyol uses Cloudflare to boost its ecommerce platform's security and performance\n\nFrom clothes and cosmetics to computers, mobile phones, and appliances, e-commerce company Trendyol offers its customers hundreds of thousands of discounted products. Based in Turkey, Trendyol has become the country's largest and fastest-growing mobile commerce company, serving over 15 million customers in collaboration with over 2,000 merchants. According to Trendyol security engineer Mert Can Coskuner, Internet security and performance are two of the company's key pillars. \"We're an e-commerce company and a technology company, which means a daily challenge of keeping our customer and merchant engagement high while maintaining security,\" he says.\n\n### __Cloudflare offers protection from huge volumes of malicious requests__\n\nTrendyol began working with Cloudflare out of a desire to secure its site without sacrificing [performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/). The relationship began with a proof-of-concept period which included the Black Friday weekend, a high-traffic and high-sales time for any [ecommerce company](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/). \n\nDuring that period, Trendyol saw the high request volumes it was expecting—far higher than it was expecting, in fact. These requests might have hurt Trendyol's site performance at a critical moment. Fortunately, the Cloudflare WAF was in place, and recognized over 85 million requests as malicious, blocking them easily:\n\n![trendyol image 1](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/60FqzxGwk26PYIFYNkXNZI/25cf5c9b51a4852d3a5f83d706714327/trendyol_image_1.png)\n\nImpressed by these results, Trendyol has continued to work with Cloudflare. And the Trendyol site has continued to stay secure. The chart below shows Trendyol's traffic for April 2020 and the events (malicious and non-malicious) that triggered Cloudflare's security protocols. In this month alone, Cloudflare supported Trendyol's business by blocking more than 180 million malicious requests. \n\n![Trendyol Image 2](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3KW8XtjWrNJN1b0HpBfTUr/97c66583f1074e7527ca996b5b0487c2/Trendyol_Image_2.png)\n\n### __Rich Cloudflare features offer flexibility and scalability__\n\nSince that initial success, Trendyol has adopted many other Cloudflare products. These include DNSSEC, rate limiting, and SSL/TLS on the security front, and managed DNS and load balancing for performance and reliability.\n\nTrendyol appreciates the ease with which they have been able to deploy these services. \"To be able to deploy so many capabilities with so much flexibility is a good feeling when it comes to the challenges that we face every day,\" says Coskuner.\n\nTrendyol also values how Cloudflare's services remain effective as Trendyol's platform attracts more users. \"Cloudflare solutions like DDoS protection are especially helpful in addressing scalability and performance issues, while functionalities like rate limiting and WAF protection filter out bad traffic upfront to only pass cleaner, safer traffic to our servers,\" Coskuner says.\n\n### __Great support and the best performance and security__\n\nAlready convinced of the value of Cloudflare technology, Mert is a fan of Cloudflare's customer support as well. \"If we have any problems regarding the platform itself or the traffic flow, we can directly communicate with Cloudflare customer support and get any data that we need. The best side of the support is being fast to respond, as we value agility not only within the company but also in the partners that we work with.\"\n\nCloudflare thus plays a pivotal role in helping Trendyol carry out its online sales mission and maintain its growth. As Coskuner says, \"we have concluded that Cloudflare offers the best of both worlds in terms of both performance and security.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## Cloudflare helps Trustbank reduce server costs by 90% and improve site performance\n\nTrustbank is the operator of \"Furusato Choice\", a charitable donation site aligned with Japan's \"hometown tax\" program. The site allows users to make tax-deductible donations to municipalities across Japan to support various development initiatives—all as a part of Trustbank's mission of  \"creating an independent and sustainable region.\" \n\nSince this program's inception in April of 2012, Trustbank staff have brought people, supplies, money, and information to such regions and circulated them within the regions while also developing various businesses under the banner of \"joint regional development\" in order to create an independent and sustainable region.\n\n__Expanding from CDN to additional services__\n\nTrustbank handles a wide variety of information on its hometown tax donation site. This includes payment data, which is always a serious security consideration. In addition, the site was being run without a Content Delivery Network (CDN) because it was read-only, initially. So when site traffic started increasing, Trustbank began searching for a CDN solution that could be used on a trial basis.\n\nAt that point, they were introduced to Cloudflare. Trustbank's business was still small in scale when they first tried Cloudflare, so they began with a free plan. Based on the free plan's performance, they soon expanded into using additional services for security—such as Cloudflare Advanced DDoS Protection—and performance—such as Load Balancing, Page Rules, and Argo Smart Routing (the latter of which finds the lowest-latency paths for origin-server-bound traffic). \n\nTrustbank especially appreciates how these services come together in Cloudflare's unified dashboard. Controlling features, obtaining insight from domain security and cache analytics, and sharing account access can be set from any device through the dashboard's design. It also features an intuitive, easy-to-understand UI. Trustbank says that they are checking on the status of its blocking performance several times per month.\n\n\n__Improved performance and reduced server costs__\n\nSince adopting Cloudflare, Trustbank has been successful at blocking illegal site access, using procedures like access blocking, communication blocking and country blocking. And since the Cloudflare CDN handles more that 90% of requests, the number of servers Trustbank requires has been reduced to 1/10th of its original number. \n\nThe Cloudflare CDN in particular has multiple benefits. On the performance side, Trustbank reports overall content delivery speed increases, along with improvements in smartphone image conversion. These improvements have a direct impact on user satisfaction. In addition, serving content through the CDN results in reduced traffic to Trustbank's origins servers. This shift has helped Trustbank save on server costs. \n\n__Cloudflare support allows for customization__\n\nSince the beginning of the relationship Trustbank has frequently used Cloudflare's enterprise support services. While this service was only available in English when they first adopted Cloudflare, it is now available in Japanese as well, and Trustbank says they have been entirely satisfied with the service they received. \n\nTrustbank continues to contribute to regions throughout Japan. They will continue to provide support for these regions together with local governments nationwide.\n\n",

						"longDescription": "## Shopify + Cloudflare: Powering 1,000,000 Storefronts on the Biggest Shopping Weekend of the Year\n\nFor over one million businesses around the world, Shopify is the beating heart that drives their online retail storefronts. Powering everything from the consumer-facing shopping experience to backend logistics, Shopify's platform facilitated over $183 *billion* in economic activity in 2016-18 alone, according to its recent [Global Economic Impact](https://news.shopify.com/now-powering-over-1-million-merchants-shopify-debuts-global-economic-impact-report-271485) report. If you do any shopping online, there's a good chance you've transacted with a store on Shopify, which is why the Canadian-headquartered company is [worth over $40 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/shop).\n\nShopify's success is all the more impressive given the ferocious competition of [online retail](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/), where a subpar shopping experience translates directly into lost revenue and erosion of consumer confidence; this is even more of a problem when customers are just a tap away from a competitor's store.\n\nThat's why Shopify is relentlessly focused on ensuring that its platform provides best-in-class performance, security, and reliability for its one million merchants. And because these stores operate from 175 countries globally — many of which sell to customers internationally — Shopify needs a robust solution that works worldwide.\n\n__The Cloudflare Difference__\n\nShopify's engineering-driven culture has no shortage of performance and security whizzes who optimize every network packet they can, but sometimes it doesn't make sense to do everything in-house. Rather than build out its own globally-distributed network footprint — which would necessitate large investments in infrastructure, expertise, and time — Shopify opted to join Cloudflare's global network, spanning 200 cities around the world.\n\nThat move translates to a major performance advantage: today, 99% of the Internet-connected population in the developed world are within 100 milliseconds of Cloudflare's network (a fraction of the blink of an eye). By extending its edge across Cloudflare's global footprint, Shopify empowers its merchants with a [faster experience](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) for their customers — driving increased sales across the platform. \n\nWith Cloudflare Load Balancing, Shopify has granular control over how its traffic is distributed between its origin servers, with the added performance and accuracy benefits of making these decisions at the network edge.\n\nPart of Shopify's core value proposition is its ease of use, so it is important to enable these benefits without imposing a burden on merchants. By using Cloudflare to broadcast its IP block, Shopify delivers faster, more reliable performance without needing merchants to modify their DNS settings.\n\nShopify's migration to Cloudflare was no small feat: the process had to be seamless, without any interruption to the 1,000,0000+ businesses on its platform (some with unique configuration challenges). Teams from Cloudflare and Shopify worked in close coordination to ensure that the migration proceeded smoothly, onboarding over one million domains and security certificates, with safeguards in place to ensure any changes could be quickly reverted. In the end, the migration was a complete success.\n\n__Black Friday: More Money, Globally__\n\nShopify's platform manages a huge volume of traffic and sales every day. But these daily demands are dwarfed every November, as consumers flock to grab the hottest deals during the blockbuster weekend spanning Black Friday through Cyber Monday. \nThis [year](https://news.shopify.com/shopify-merchants-break-records-with-29-billion-in-worldwide-sales-over-black-fridaycyber-monday-weekend), Shopify saw aggregate sales revenue across its merchants surge by over 60%, from $1.8+ billion in 2018 to an even-more staggering $2.9+ billion in 2019. Over 25.5 million customers made purchases across Shopify's platform, with peak sales traffic of $1.5 million per minute — nearly double the $870K- peak sales per-minute seen last year.\n\nEven more impressive is the increasingly global, on-the-go distribution of these customers. Black Friday has evolved into a global tradition: 19% of all purchases made across Shopify's storefronts were shipped across international borders. And 69% of sales over the weekend were made on phones or tablets, which often operate under suboptimal network conditions — underscoring the importance of Shopify's global presence and performance at the network edge, powered by Cloudflare.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Black Friday is one of the most important days for our merchants every year, and 2019 was the biggest of them all, with consumers around the world shopping more than ever. With the support of Cloudflare, we were able to handle the demand during this shopping season and deliver lightning-fast responses to shoppers globally.\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Charles Ng</center>\n  <center>Production Engineering Manager, Shopify</i></center>\n</br>",

						"longDescription": "## __Fintech Startup BharatPe Automates Security with Cloudflare__\n\nFueled by ultra-low mobile data prices, inexpensive smartphones, and 4G penetration, mobile data consumption in India skyrocketed 56-fold between 2014 and 2018. It was against this backdrop that Bhavik Koladiya co-founded BharatPe, a merchant payment processing company aimed at more than 10 million small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in India that don't have an Internet presence. \n\nBharatPe empowers these merchants by offering them a single interface through which they can accept any payment apps — over 150 of which are available in India — at no cost to the business. All merchants need to do is sign up, download a single QR code for their customers to scan, and start accepting payments, which are transferred directly into their bank accounts. Electronic deposits are an enormous convenience in rural India, Koladiya notes, because the nearest bank could be 20 miles away.\n\n__Cyberattacks force other engineering projects to the back burner__\n\nCybersecurity has been a central concern for Koladiya since BharatPe's early days, in part because the platform came under attack as soon as it launched. \"Every day, we were getting pummeled with attacks from Russia, from China, from everywhere,\" he explains. \"The hackers just kept coming, targeting our open APIs with SQL injections and brute force attacks.\"\n\nThese attacks impeded BharatPe's ability to scale effectively as the platform took off. Within a year of launching, they had onboarded over 2.5 million merchants, and had gone from processing 300 transactions per day to processing over 1.5 million. Yet the company's engineers kept being pulled into time-intensive security projects like identifying their attackers' IPs, a task that took nearly three months. \"Literally half of my back-end team's focus was going into preventing cyberattacks,\" Koladiya says. \"Everything else had to go on the back burner.\" \n\nThese attacks also risked something equally important as growth: customers' trust. \"Vendors rely on us to make their living,\" says Koladiya. \"Typical high-growth startups usually focus on scale first, and then security, but we're in the payment business. Security has to come before scale.\"\n\n__Cloudflare security solutions provide peace of mind and time to scale business needs__\n\nKoladiya was assembling a four- to five-person team that would be dedicated solely to fending off cyberattacks when a business associate told him about Cloudflare. He was initially skeptical that anyone could solve his massive security problems with an automated solution, but agreed to a meeting.\n\n\"They showed us what their WAF (web application firewall) could do, and we were very impressed,\" he recalls. \"It looked like it could solve our problems immediately.\"\n\nIt did. Koladiya and his team went from being locked in a constant battle with hackers to watching the Cloudflare WAF lock cybercriminals out. \"Since we implemented the WAF, we haven't devoted a single man-hour to fixing a security problem,\" Koladiya says. \n\nThrilled with the immediate results they saw with the WAF, BharatPe began investigating how Cloudflare's solutions could be implemented in other areas of the business. For example, BharatPe is building a new platform for shoppers that will allow them to perform a location search for merchants that accept certain apps. This process will require BharatPe to expose their database, which makes them vulnerable to automated data scraping attacks. \n\n\"With Cloudflare Bot Management, we won't have to worry about that,\" says Koladiya. \"Instead of trying to configure the code ourselves, we can incorporate Bot Management and focus on building a product that users will love.\"\n\nIn addition to strengthening BharatPe's security, Cloudflare has dramatically minimized the time it takes to onboard new banking partners. \"Before partnering with Cloudflare,\" Koladiya says, \"it took the team nearly three months to integrate one API with a bank. Now, it takes less than a week.\"\n\n__A single point of contact to call anytime — even at 3 a.m.__\n\nExtreme time zone differences can present a big challenge when international companies decide to partner with Silicon Valley firms; as Americans prepare for sleep, Indian companies are just starting their day. Koladiya says that Cloudflare stands out in this area as well.\n\n\"We have a single point of contact that we can call in the middle of the night for technical support,\" he says. \"If my engineers are having a problem at 3:00 a.m., they can't wait for an office to open at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Having a contact that I can pick up the phone and talk to at any time of the day or night is huge.\"\n\nKoladiya is a veteran in the startup space and has worked with other vendors, but he says he would recommend Cloudflare over the competition without hesitation.\n\n\"If a startup founder came to me and said they were worried about security or scale, I would tell them to partner with Cloudflare. Cloudflare knows what they're doing. You can just let them do what they're good at, and you can focus on the things that you're good at.\"\n",

This video explores some of the benefits of this fruitful partnership.*\n\nThe video features:\n- __Eric Rescorla, CTO, Firefox__\n- __Selena Deckelmann, Vice President, Firefox Desktop__\n- __Nick Sullivan, Head of Research & Cryptography, Cloudflare__\n\n\n__Eric Rescorla:__\nThe real privilege of working at Mozilla is that we're a mission-driven organization, and what that means is that before we do things, we ask what's good for the user, as opposed to what's going to make the most money.\n\n__Nick Sullivan:__\nMozilla's values are similar to Cloudflare's. They care about enabling the web for everybody in a way that is secure, in a way that is private, and in a way that is trustworthy.\n\nWe've been collaborating on improving the protocols that help secure connections between browsers and websites.\n\n__Eric Rescorla:__ \nMozilla and Cloudflare have collaborated on a wide range of technologies. The first place we really collaborated was the new TLS 1.3 protocol, and then we followed it up with QUIC and DNS over HTTPS, and most recently the new Firefox Private Network. \n\n__Selena Deckelmann:__\nDNS is core to the way that everything on the Internet works. It's a very old protocol, and it's also in plain text, meaning that it's not encrypted. And this is something that a lot of people don't realize. You can be using SSL and connecting securely to websites, but your DNS traffic may still be unencrypted.\n\n__Eric Rescorla:__\nWhen Mozilla was looking for a partner for providing encrypted DNS, Cloudflare was a natural fit.\n\nThe idea was that Cloudflare would run the server piece of it, and Mozilla would run the client piece of it. And the consequence would be that we'd protect DNS traffic for anybody who used Firefox.\n\n__Selena Deckelmann:__\nCloudflare was a great partner with this because they were really willing early on to implement the protocol, stand up a Trusted Recursive Resolver and create this experience for users. They were strong supporters of it.\n\n__Eric Rescorla:__\nOne of the great things about working with Cloudflare is their engineers are crazy fast. So the time between we decide to do something and we write down the barest protocol sketch, and they have it running in their infrastructure is a matter of days to weeks, not a matter of months to years. There's a difference between standing up a service that one person can use or ten people can use, and a service that everybody on the Internet can use.\n\n__Nick Sullivan:__\nWhen we talk about bringing new protocols to the Web, we're talking about bringing it not to millions, not to tens of millions. We're talking about hundreds of millions to billions of people.\n\n__Selena Deckelmann:__\nCloudflare has been an amazing partner in the privacy front. They've been willing to be extremely transparent about the data that they are collecting and why they're using it. And they've also been willing to throw those logs away.\n\n__Eric Rescorla:__\nReally users are getting two classes of benefits out of our partnership with Cloudflare. The first is direct benefits, that is: we're offering services to the user that make them more secure and we're offering them via Cloudflare. So that's like an immediate benefit that users are getting. The indirect benefit that users are getting is that we're developing the next generation of security and privacy technology and Cloudflare's helping us do it. And that will ultimately benefit every user — both Firefox users and every user on the Internet.\n\n__Nick Sullivan:__\nWe're really excited to work with an organization like Mozilla that is aligned with the user's interests and in taking the Internet and moving it in a direction that is more private, more secure, and is aligned with what we think the Internet should be.\n\n",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare helps provide the foundation for Trusted Media Brands' digital transformation as it modernizes its web properties to serve a new generation of digitally savvy readers.",
						"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps drive the digital transformation of Trusted Media Brands__ \n\nWith a mission to provide \"authentic, empowering, and uplifting content,\" Trusted Media Brands is behind some of the most well-known family-, home-, and hobby-centered publications in the United States, including Reader's Digest, Taste of Home, and Family Handyman. All together, its online publications attract 33 million unique visitors each month, and its total digital revenue has grown by 98% in the past five years.\n\nOver the past few years, Trusted Media Brands has been finding ways to expand its appeal to digitally savvy consumers. After being brought on as CEO in 2014, Bonnie Kintzer knew Trusted Media Brands needed to radically transform from a hard-copy magazine publisher into a digital-first, multi platform media company. \n\n__The challenge: Deliver high-quality content to visitors as quickly as possible__\n\nWhen Nick Contardo joined Trusted Media Brands as Chief Technology Officer, the company was doing little more than republishing hard-copy magazine content onto its websites. Trusted Media Brands used a content delivery network (CDN), but Contardo felt it wasn't a good fit for the company's ambitious digital plans. \"[It] didn't have any varnish or customizability at the edge. It had an old, monolithic structure,\" he recalls. \"I was nervous that they wouldn't be able to support us moving forward. We needed a CDN that could perform for us.\"\n\nIn a world where most media websites rely heavily on dynamic content, Trusted Media Brands is unique. Nearly all of its content is evergreen and static. \"Once a recipe, a home improvement project, or a Reader's Digest article is published, they don't get changed that often,\" Contardo explains. \"We also don't have a lot of login content or personalization.\"\n\nPage speed, Contardo explains, is key to satisfying the company's audiences, who visit their sites for solutions to specific problems. \"Our visitors are very intent-driven. They're not coming to our sites just to look at pictures. They want to cook something, build something, or learn something. We don't push out 5,000 articles a month. We focus on content quality and page speed. We publish high-quality articles, served fast, on stable websites.\"\n\nThis need made Cloudflare an excellent match for Trusted Media Brands. Cloudflare would help the company exert more control over its network edge and cache, and would provide a powerful Web Application Firewall as well. \"We don't have a lot of reasons to bypass cache,\" Contardo explains. He, along with DevOps Manager Olena Sokolova, wanted to speed up the company's web properties by delivering as much content at the edge, from cache, as possible.\n\n__The solution: Using Cloudflare Workers to increase cache hit rates__\n\nTrusted Media Brands used Cloudflare Workers to develop a solution that delivers an exceptional cache hit rate, improving their website's performance and position in search results.\n\n\"We can get hit with a lot of traffic after we send out a newsletter,\" Sokolova says. \"Before we had Workers, we had no choice but to bypass the cache for entire newsletter traffic, both due to the legal and data analysis reasons. This wasn't a good option; we knew if something happened to our internal infrastructure, we'd have to either cancel newsletters or use another solution that wouldn't be beneficial to the company.\"\nBefore Workers, Sokolova explains, all visitors from newsletter traffic would always receive an uncached page, while less than 1% of them needed to see unique content (e.g. to update email preferences). With Workers, Trusted Media Brands was able to program logic ensuring that only visitors who need to see unique information receive an uncached page. Content for all other users from newsletter traffic would be served from a common cache, dramatically improving their online experience. \"Even when 1000 people are hitting the same article at the same time, all of them are being served from Cloudflare's cache,\" Sokolova says.\n\nThanks to Workers and Cloudflare cache, an average of 96% to 98% of Trusted Media Brands' content is served from cache. Sokolova reports that between this impressive cache hit rate and Cloudflare's image optimization solutions, Trusted Media Brands' sites are loading four times faster than they would have with their previous solution.\n\nBecause nearly all of its content can be served from stale cache, Contardo says, \"We can look at Cloudflare almost as a disaster recovery solution. We could take our servers down for two days, and our sites would remain up.\"\n\n\"Cloudflare Workers allowed us to maximize our use of Cloudflare caching. No other solution could have done this for us,\" Sokolova adds. \"We could have managed to do it on the server level, but by using Cloudflare, our sites are faster and more reliable, and we save money on bandwidth and infrastructure.\"\n\n__Blocking malicious bots with WAF and Rate Limiting__\n\nSince Trusted Media Brands runs high-profile, high-traffic websites, it's a target for malicious bots.\n\n\"The Cloudflare WAF setup was fast to deploy and easy to use. From the time we first turned it on, we've tripled our traffic, but it just scaled.\" Contardo notes.\n\nSokolova echoes Contardo's comments about the Cloudflare WAF's ease of use, especially when setting very specific traffic settings. \"We're discussing the launch of a new product with more granular location settings, which means very granular rules for traffic,\" she says. \n\nIn addition to the Cloudflare WAF, Trusted Media Brands uses Cloudflare Rate Limiting to protect its sites from malicious bots in situations where content cannot be cached. \"Rate Limiting protects us in situations where we can't cache,\" Sokolova explains. \"It blocks malicious traffic while letting valid users through.\"\n\n__Cloudflare provides peace of mind__\n\nAbove all, Contardo and Sokolova agree, Cloudflare offers peace of mind.\n\n\"Our previous CDN provider, Verizon, was always giving us issues,\" says Contardo. \"Cloudflare's services just work. It's one less thing for me to have to think about or worry about.\"\n\n\"Cloudflare has one of the best technical support teams I've personally worked with,\" says Sokolova. \"When something does go wrong, I have confidence that Cloudflare will address the problem and protect our sites.\"\n",

When creating a new section of the site dedicated to buying properties outside of Sweden, they decided to start this process by first considering users' needs.\n\n## The challenge\n\nWhen Swedish buyers want to buy a property outside of Sweden, they typically start by browsing around to find more information about a certain area and understand how the property market works in that country. The search behaviour is therefore fundamentally different from the one adopted when searching properties within Sweden. The main goal is finding good information about an area and a country, and from there, identifying a trustworthy agent who can be a supportive guide in the transaction.\n\nThis is why Hemnet decided to focus its Utland (Abroad) section on articles and inspiration centered on different regions, rather than directly listing properties on it.\n\n\"Instead of using our 'normal' platform, we wanted to create a standalone place where broker agencies and offices could list their services for different countries and regions,\" says Christoffer Hamberg, Technical Director at Hemnet.\n\nRather than building this feature into their main Ruby on Rails application, Hemnet's team decided to build out a static site generated by Gatsby, while using Contentful as the data source. To serve the site, they turned to Cloudflare Workers.\n\n## Hemnet goes global with serverless technology\n\nHemnet already used Cloudflare's integrated security and performance solutions, and had been increasingly intrigued by the capabilities of their serverless platform, Cloudflare Workers. To Hamberg, this appeared to be the perfect use case.\n\nWorkers, a lightweight JavaScript execution environment, allows users to create, deploy, and scale serverless applications on the Cloudflare global network. Backed by a network that stretches across 200 cities and 90+ countries worldwide, each application is able to run in the data center that sits closest to the end user, reducing potential end-to-end latency and ensuring optimal performance and uptime.\n\nWith Workers and Page Rules working in tandem, Hemnet was able to set up Hemnet Utland on their main domain. Hemnet Utland allows buyers to connect with broker agencies outside of Sweden. The site maintains a list of broker agencies based in France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, and supplements this service with short, informative articles about each region.\n\nNot only did Workers help Hemnet reach their customers quickly and efficiently, but it also proved easy to configure, enabling Hemnet to save considerable time and internal resources as they launched the site.\n\n\"Cloudflare Workers (and the Page Rules) allowed us to quickly launch Hemnet Utland on our main domain without touching that code base,\" Hamberg says. \"A big plus was also the fact that a small product team was able to quickly build and set up the site with minimal help from the platform team, which typically handles new features and apps for us.\"\n\n## Integrated security and performance solutions without vendor lock-in\n\nUtilizing serverless technology is a major advantage for Hemnet, which strives to push the envelope in order to deliver an innovative and seamless user experience. As they continue to expand their properties, however, they also need to ensure that their sites remain fast and secure.\n\nHemnet uses the Cloudflare global CDN in tandem with security services like the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Advanced DDoS Protection, which lets them protect their sites from incoming threats like malicious requests and volumetric DDoS attacks without seeing a significant increase in latency or degradation in user experience. Thanks to Cloudflare's built-in DDoS protection, Hemnet is able to block over 100,000 threats every month.\n\nEven as Hemnet relies on Cloudflare for integrated security, performance, and serverless solutions, they are able to mitigate vendor lock-in. Cloudflare acts as a layer of abstraction between client and vendor, empowering users to use the Cloudflare product stack in front of various types of infrastructure and cloud providers — without being forced to use bundled services from a single vendor that doesn't meet all of their needs.\n\nThat makes all the difference to Hemnet, as they value the flexibility, long-term vision, and integrated solutions Cloudflare provides.\n\n\"Performance is a fundamental part of the user experience and Hemnet wants to provide a best-in-class experience for our users,\" says Hamberg. \"But above all comes the security aspect which we will never compromise on. Cloudflare allows us to deliver both to our users, ensuring that they can access our services in as fast and secure a manner as possible.\"",

						"shortDescription": "Cloudflare Magic Transit helps TownNews mitigate DDoS attacks on their on-prem network infrastructure.",
						"longDescription": "TownNews provides digital transformation solutions for local media companies, serving over 2,000 newspaper, broadcast, magazine, and web-native publications. Newspapers and broadcast use TownNews' integrated content management system (CMS) to publish multimedia news content. TownNews also offers over 100 ancillary products to help media companies boost subscription purchases and ad sales.\n\n\"We're very heavy into smart analytics that can help our customers make data-driven decisions,\" explains Chris Murley, Director of Product & Infrastructure. \"Several of our current and upcoming product offerings revolve around large data silos where we crunch data for customers and give them high-level dashboards where they can perform A/B testing and determine the best ways to maximize revenue by attracting new subscribers.\"\n\n__The challenge: Replace a complex, costly DDoS service__\n\nMedia outlets have long been prime targets for DDoS attacks. Concerned about the potential of these attacks to degrade its CMS' performance, TownNews partnered with a cloud-based DDoS defense service.\n\nUnfortunately, TownNews rarely used the service because of its complexity. \n\n\"We don't get hit with very large attacks often, but when they do happen, we need to be able to mitigate them quickly,\" Murley says. \"Every time we had an attack, we ended up dealing with it ourselves because our vendor made us call them to turn it on, and then, it would take them over 45 minutes to do it. We'd end up isolating the attack source before they did. There were also lots of issues with their traffic flows, filtering, and logic rules. It was so painful, we became accustomed to absorbing the attack on-prem.\" \n\nCost was also an issue. \"At the time, five to six years ago, no DDoS vendors had a good offering. They all charged exorbitant monthly fees for something we only wanted to use on-demand, with tons of surcharges on top of that. Then, contracts gave them an option to cancel the service if the attack was too large.,\" Murley explains.\n\n__The solution: Magic Transit gives TownNews a flexible, affordable option for on-prem DDoS protection__  \n\nTownNews signed up for Cloudflare's Magic Transit service, which extends DDoS protection to on-prem infrastructure. The company had already been using the Cloudflare CDN for some time. \"When Cloudflare approached us about being part of a Magic Transit beta test, it sounded like a perfect match,\" Murley says. \"We already had a lot of trust in Cloudflare, so trying Magic Transit was a no-brainer.\"\n\nMurley was delighted at how easy the contract negotiation process was and appreciated Cloudflare's predictable pricing model. \"We're used to dealing with DDoS vendors with complex contracts full of 'gotcha's,' like bandwidth overage fees and charging us $4,000 every time we want to turn the DDoS protection on. Cloudflare charges us a flat monthly rate, with no bandwidth overage fees and no fees for turning Magic Transit on. Their no-nonsense, no-hassle approach is unique and refreshing.\"\n\nUsing Magic Transit, Murley found, was just as easy. \"Since Magic Transit is completely software-defined with capabilities for global mitigation, our traffic does not have to be rerouted to a distant scrubbing center, it is so much better than other vendors out there,\" he says. \"We love that it's controllable via an API. It's so much faster and easier than the DDoS solution we were using before. We were happy to send a cancellation notice to our previous vendor.\"\n\nBy utilizing Magic Transit, TownNews saves money on additional hardware while ensuring that a large DDoS attack won't impact site performance. \"Because of Magic Transit, TownNews doesn't have to make huge investments in routing infrastructure and circuits to re-route traffic during DDoS attacks. We also don't have to worry about performance degradation. Once you come under attack and turn on additional rules, you reduce the capacity that device can process real-time. It's not feasible for a company like ours to have 100 terabytes of network capacity.\"\n\n__Using Cloudflare CDN to provide world-class performance in a challenging scenario__\n\nFast page loads and low latency are critical to convincing news consumers to buy subscriptions and keeping them around long enough to click on ads, so scalability is key to TownNews' offerings.\n\n\"Part of our promise is that even during heavy traffic spikes, our customers enjoy world-class infrastructure, with page load times under three seconds,\" Murley says. \"If a tiny news site suddenly gets a huge amount of traffic, we scale up to meet it instantly. If a large news site gets record traffic, they'll have consistently fast page loads.\"\n\nWhile the ability to offload traffic through Cloudflare CDN has always helped TownNews' offer its customers this robust performance at an affordable price; the COVID-19 pandemic has made Cloudflare CDN even more valuable. Since the pandemic began, the company's customers are seeing up to a 50% increase in daily traffic.\n\n\"A tiny newspaper with a staff of two people might post a video that goes viral, and suddenly, they go from maybe 1000 viewers a day to millions a day,\" Murley explains. \"On a daily basis, we're offloading a huge amount of traffic. If we tried to handle all of that traffic on-prem, we'd be spending about an additional $15,000 each month on hardware and circuits.\"\nCloudflare saves TownNews money and hassle\n\nMurley enjoys working with Cloudflare's sales team. \"I used to dread annual contract renewals,\" he admits, \"but I haven't had any negative experiences with Cloudflare. Right now, during COVID-19, it's insane what some other companies are doing. It's refreshing to see a company like Cloudflare doing what they can to help their customers.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Axios thwarts attacks and future proofs infrastructure with Cloudflare__\n\nAs reliance on print media continues to decline, more people are tracking breaking news on digital-native news websites and social media platforms than ever before. Readers want convenience, brevity, and value from a trusted source — and that's where Axios shines.\n\nLaunched by Jim VandeHei, Roy Schwartz and Mike Allen in 2017, Axios is an American news website that produces short, bullet point-laden articles designed to capture attention and educate quickly. The strategy is working: the site saw more than 19 million visits in January 2020, while more than half a million subscribers receive one or more of their newsletters on topics like politics, sports, business, technology, and the world.\n\n\"Our mission is to get people smarter, faster on what matters,\" says Jess Szmajda, Chief Technology Officer at Axios. \"We connect people with things that matter in the world, in the most efficient and worthy use of their time.\"\n\n__The challenge__\n\nEven as Axios seeks to differentiate itself and build a strong audience, they still face the same security vulnerabilities that affect their competitors in the online news industry. High-profile media organizations have been targeted by DDoS attacks designed to overwhelm their networks and compromise sensitive information. For Axios, launching a proactive defense against would-be attackers is a top-of-mind concern.\n\n\"High news consumption and surges in traffic from breaking news means that media companies are constantly at risk or under a DDoS attack,\" Szmajda explains.\n\nThey're not the only ones. According to the 101 organizations polled in the 2019 US Signal State of Web and DDoS Attacks Survey, more than 80 percent of respondents faced a DDoS attack over the last two years, and more than 50 percent were targeted on multiple occasions.\n\nAxios requires bulletproof security protocols that can offer standout protection against DDoS attacks. They also need exceptional performance solutions that allow them to reach their global audience and handle the massive traffic spikes associated with breaking news cycles. Cloudflare provided both.\n\n__Integrated security and performance solutions help Axios build trustworthiness__\n\nUnwilling to risk a massive DDoS attack slowing down their site, Axios turned to Cloudflare to help get ahead. Cloudflare Advanced DDos Protection defends Axios from volumetric DDoS attacks by automatically blocking malicious traffic, while delivering content from Cloudflare's global network, spanning 200 cities in more than 90 countries. This helps ensure that readers never experience a site outage or significant slowdown.\n\nThat level of security gives Axios peace of mind and helps them uphold one of their core tenets: to build and retain reader trust.\n\n\"Our audience's ability to access our content at all times is critical to our brand reputation,\" Szmajda says. \"It's imperative that we choose a partner we can rely on to make sure that the right people can read our articles and that the wrong people can't take our site down.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare's security solution in place, Axios has never suffered the effects of a targeted DDoS attack.\n\nThe Cloudflare network not only shields Axios from incoming threats, but also delivers their content to readers as expeditiously as possible. By serving content closer to end users, Axios can extend their reach around the world, whether a reader is following political events in Copenhagen or perusing sports coverage in Philadelphia.\n\n\"People depend on Axios to do their jobs in real time, so delivering a fast and efficient user experience was top-of-mind as we considered different services,\" adds Szmajda.\n\nCloudflare also acts as a layer of abstraction between Axios and their cloud provider, which helps them circumvent vendor lock-in and ensures that they have the freedom to select the best solutions for their needs.\n\n__Axios expands edge capabilities with Cloudflare Workers__\n\nAfter establishing a strong defense against DDoS attacks and improving site performance, Axios turned their attention to Cloudflare Workers, a serverless platform that allows users to build and deploy custom applications at the network edge using simple JavaScript.\n\nAxios engineers use Cloudflare Workers to deliver ESI (Edge-Side-Includes) functionality, which empowers them to cache static content while filling in dynamic page elements. As a result, Axios can cache everything and save hits against their origin.\n\n\"Thanks to the availability of some of Cloudflare's off-the-shelf examples and libraries, our engineers can produce very capable proof-of-concepts in a relatively short time,\" Szmajda explains. \"Now, we can build functions that are more understandable and maintainable over time.\" \n",

With over 400 institutions across the United States as clients — which themselves deliver banking services to millions of customers — Holtmeyer & Monson is responsible for a high volume of assets that makes them a tempting target for malicious actors.\n\nWhat makes Holtmeyer & Monson's situation highly relevant to many businesses today is that its team has always been distributed. Stephen Webb, H&M's director of IT, explains how he thinks about his team's security posture in a world where legacy approaches don't fit, while meeting the strict regulatory requirements of the financial industry.\n\n\"Our whole team is remote, working from home offices.

						"longDescription": "*This story was adapted from an original guest post written by Marc Campbell and Grant Miller, co-founders of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/). For a more in-depth look at how Campbell and Miller leveraged Cloudflare Access and Argo Tunnel to develop a cloud-based IaaS solution, visit the [Cloudflare Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-replicated-secured-our-remote-dev-environment-with-cloudflare-access/).*\n\nThere is no doubt that the world is becoming more Internet-connected, and that deployment environments are becoming more complex. It stands to reason that it's only a matter of time before all software development happens through and in concert with the Internet. \n\nFounded in 2014, Replicated is an infrastructure software company with a focus on enabling a new model of enterprise software delivery called Kubernetes Off-The-Shelf (KOTS) Software. Their goal is to make it easy for users to install and operate third party software, so that sending data to multi-tenant SaaS providers isn't the only way to use those providers' services.\n\n\"We think that it's possible and easy to bring the applications to your data, securely and without a lot of operational overhead,\" Campbell and Miller say.\n\n## The challenge\n\nAt Replicated, the development environment needs to run on Kubernetes, since KOTS runs in Kubernetes and manages the lifecycle of 3rd-party applications in the Kubernetes cluster. Building and validating the product requires a developer to have access to a cluster.\n\nSince Replicated's engineering team had grown to include dedicated front end engineers and other specialists who shouldn't have to worry about building and maintaining their own cluster, the complexity of managing a local environment became a burden. They needed to simplify in order to maintain developer productivity.\n\n\"We'd lose hours every week from engineers troubleshooting their local environments,\" Campbell and Miller explain. \"When a front end engineer (who wasn't expected to be a Kubernetes expert) would have issues, they'd need to pair and get help from a backend engineer; consuming not just one but two people's valuable time. We needed something better.\"\n\nWhile searching for a solution that would be simple to implement and maintain, Replicated turned to Cloudflare. Initially, they had used Cloudflare for DNS and DDoS protection, but over time, they started to utilize additional Cloudflare services to help keep their own services available and secure.\n\n## Replicated uses Cloudflare to secure their development environment in the cloud\n\nReplicated has designed a solution that uses cloud-based infrastructure components, accessed and secured with Cloudflare Access and Argo Tunnel, to move their development environment to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) resources. This means that their entire development environment is in the cloud.\n\nAs a result, they've reduced the amount of time that a developer spends troubleshooting their local environment, allowing every engineer on the team to maintain a full stack development environment — even if they are without deep Kubernetes expertise.\n\n\"This configuration has several advantages over a traditional deployment,\" say Campbell and Miller. \"For one, the server does not have a public IP and we don't need to have any ports open in the Google Load Balancer, including for SSH. The only way to connect to these servers is through the Argo Tunnel, secured by Cloudflare Access. Access provides a BeyondCorp-style method of authentication, which ensures that the environment can be reached from anywhere in the world without the use of a VPN.\"\n\n## Cloudflare Access puts security fears to rest\n\nNow, Replicated can write a policy that defines which machines a user should have access to and trust that it will be applied everywhere. Instead of managing SSH certificates (which are long-living and hard to revoke), they can allow developers to login with the same Google credentials they use everywhere else. Even if a developer leaves, they can revoke those credentials instantly, so they don't have to worry about any public keys they still might have lying around.\n\nWith Cloudflare Access, Replicated's developers can easily set up multiple environments (to try out a new k8s version, for example), and they don't need the biggest and most powerful laptops to do so. They can also choose their local OS and environment (MacOS, Windows, Linux) because every version is supported, as long as SSH is also supported. And, since code does not live on a developer's laptop, it doesn't travel with them to coffee shops or other insecure places. This is a key benefit when it comes to security, since losing a laptop no longer means that the codebase is compromised along with it.\n\n\"With the help of Cloudflare Access and Argo Tunnel, every development environment has become a collaborative place,\" Campbell and Miller say. \"This is great when two engineers aren't in the same room. Also, we're less attached to our development environments — if my server isn't working properly for unknown reasons, instead of troubleshooting it for hours, I can delete it and get a new clean one.\"",

						"shortDescription": "orderbird uses Cloudflare WAF to protect against cyber attacks and keep their POS system running efficiently and reliably for over 10,000 customers.",
						"longDescription": "Founded in 2011, orderbird provides market-leading point-of-sales (POS) solutions to over 10,000 restaurants, cafés, bars, clubs, ice cream shops, and beer gardens in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and France. The company's mission is to make individual restaurants more successful by providing them with affordable and easy-to-use payment technology.\n\n## orderbird meets DDoS challenges head-on with Cloudflare\n\nIn December 2016, orderbird faced a heavy distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that nearly took the company out of business.\n\n\"During Christmas time, our backend was DDoSed and went down for a couple of days,\" says Frank Schlesinger, Chief Technical Officer of orderbird. \"For a restaurant, Christmas is usually a very important time — you have to manage all of the bookings and prepare for the festivities — and our customers couldn't use their point-of-sales systems at all. As a result, we lost a significant amount of our customer base.\"\n\nThis was a serious problem even by the standards of many business-critical applications. Network connectivity and backend availability were essential parts of the overall POS system, and if it happened to go down for any reason, their customers' businesses could not receive orders and may have then lost revenue.\n\nWithin a few days of the attack, orderbird moved their entire backend onto AWS and added Cloudflare's security solutions to safeguard their platform and ensure 100% uptime.\n\n\"We made a quick move to Cloudflare, because its services promised help immediately,\" Schlesinger explains. \"We stayed with Cloudflare because it gives us security without a headache.\"\n\nCloudflare helps orderbird mitigate DDoS attacks by leveraging the capacity of the Cloudflare global network. Cloudflare's network spans 200 cities in 90+ countries around the world, using collective intelligence from 26+ million properties to quickly protect against new and zero-day vulnerabilities. Combined with the power of the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), which detects and blocks malicious traffic in real-time, orderbird is able to deflect any attacks that may take their system offline.\n\nSince switching to Cloudflare, Schlesinger says the company hasn't noticed any successful attacks on their system.\n\n\"We track how many threats Cloudflare is filtering, which is about 1,500 every month,\" he explains. \"There have been zero successful attacks on our services since 2017.\"\n\n## Integrated security and performance solutions give orderbird peace of mind\n\nIn order to provide a smooth user experience, orderbird needs to be able to shield their POS system from incoming attacks without compromising the speed and reliability of their services. Often, implementing new security measures can increase latency and other performance issues, since requests need to be checked against multiple security features in order to effectively prevent attacks.\n\nWith Cloudflare, orderbird doesn't have that problem. Cloudflare's suite of performance solutions, including CDN and Load Balancing, significantly reduces end-to-end latency, allowing orderbird to integrate low-latency security products like WAF and Advanced DDoS Protection while still saving on valuable milliseconds.\n\nIn addition to the Cloudflare WAF, orderbird also uses Cloudflare Managed DNS to deliver as-fast-as-possible response times, mitigate DNS-based DDoS attacks, and maintain 100% uptime at the edge. And, with Cloudflare Rate Limiting, orderbird protects their critical resources at the application layer by blocking or qualifying visitors with suspicious request rates. Now, orderbird has peace of mind knowing that their security posture doesn't interfere with their ability to keep their system fast and reliable.\n\n## orderbird enlists Cloudflare to help make data-informed business decisions\n\nAfter securing and accelerating their applications with Cloudflare, orderbird started utilizing Cloudflare Logs to gain greater insights into their traffic patterns and site performance.\n\n\"I'm pretty data-driven,\" says Schlesinger. \"I was immediately impressed with all of the in-platform dashboard analytics that Cloudflare provides, which lets us see basic things like threats over the course of a couple of weeks or the ups and downs of requests.\"\n\nCloudflare provides effortless analytics integrations with third-party tools and providers like Datadog, enabling Schlesinger to track the behavior of orderbird's traffic and make more informed scalability decisions.\n\n\"I can look at my trend line, which gives me a very rough estimate on how my overall traffic develops,\" Schlesinger adds. \"Then, I can use that data to answer questions about our scaling strategies or do things like put a number into my cloud budget for the next year.\"\n\nThanks to Cloudflare, orderbird is able to observe critical data patterns that have a true impact on the future of their business. With the insights provided in their dashboard, Schlesinger and his team can monitor unusual spikes in traffic, see if a suspicious number of requests are coming from a country where orderbird does not conduct business, or figure out the best time to deploy a new feature. That gives orderbird the confidence to trust Cloudflare — not just as an integral component of their security posture, but as a part of their ongoing growth, too.",

						"shortDescription": "Neto thwarts cyber attacks and safeguards its ecommerce platform with Cloudflare WAF and Bot Management.",
						"longDescription": "## Neto leverages Cloudflare to secure and supercharge their ecommerce platform\n\nNeto is a cloud-based, omnichannel ecommerce platform that enables merchants to easily list their products on selling platforms such as Amazon Marketplace, eBay, Catch Marketplace, and their own [web stores](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/), and to manage all inventory and orders from a centralised place. Neto's platform is used by thousands of merchants, predominantly in Australia, ranging from single-shop sellers to large multi-warehouse retailers and wholesalers.\n\n## Neto's challenge: Build trust with customers by providing a high-performing, highly secure, reliable platform\n\nAs one of the largest ecommerce providers in Australia, Neto's platform receives between 85 and 90 million requests per day. \"Performance, reliability, and security form the backbone of what we do,\" says Justin Hennessy, VP of Engineering. \"We take security very seriously. Our merchants need a resilient platform that stays available and high-performing even during DDoS attacks, server failures, and other emergencies.\"\n\nAchieving this [high performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) is challenging. As a SaaS provider, Neto is a major target for DDoS attacks, malicious bots, and other cyber attacks. In addition, because their solution serves online merchants, many of the requests hitting Neto's platform are bandwidth-heavy image traffic.\n\nWhat's more, the platform must also be able to seamlessly and rapidly scale during busy seasons such as the winter holidays, when traffic can spike dramatically. \"There cannot be a situation where it's Black Friday, and our platform goes down or starts running really slowly,\" says Hennessy. \"That would destroy the trust we've worked so hard to build with our customers.\"\n\n## Achieving security and simplicity with SSL for SaaS, Bot Management, and Cloudflare WAF\n\nNeto initially adopted Cloudflare in order to automate ongoing work that was taking up critical technical resources. \n\n\"SSL for SaaS was the primary driver of why we began using Cloudflare,\" Hennessy explains. \"At the time, our merchant onboarding process, which included setting up SSL certificates for new customers, took a couple of days and only specialized personnel could work on it.\"\n\nCloudflare SSL for SaaS makes it easy for SaaS providers to enable SSL (TLS) on customers' CNAME vanity domains, removing the burden of SSL certificate management. The solution transformed Neto's customer onboarding into a completely automated, one-click process that any employee can perform. \"The ability to automate processes was the primary pain point that Cloudflare solved for us,\" Hennessy notes.\n\nNeto has also benefited from the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Bot Management. \"We turned Bot Management on a couple of weeks ago, and on the first day, we blocked 2.4 million requests, which obviously has a pretty significant cost effect over time,\" Hennessy recalls.\n\nFrom time to time, Neto experiences automated attacks against its platform. The sophistication of these attacks are increasing and, at times, the usual static methods of blocking the types of threats in question don't work. This is where Bot Management bridges the gap. \"With the use of Cloudflare's logs, and assistance from Cloudflare's technical support team, we were able to identify, visualize, and mitigate the issues,\" Hennessy says. \"Without Bot Management, we would have had quite a big challenge dealing with that attack.\"\n\nSince then, Bot Management and the WAF have allowed Neto to block an average of 15,000 to 16,000 attacks per day.\n\n\"Security used to keep me up at night,\" says Hennessy. \"The security of our platform is the key to a successful future, not just for us, but also for our merchants. Cloudflare helps to mitigate a lot of those fears.\"\n\n## Reducing bandwidth and improving performance with Cloudflare Global CDN and serverless computing\n\nNow that Neto uses the Cloudflare global CDN to cache content, only 50% of their traffic goes to their origin servers, significantly reducing their bandwidth expenditures.\n\nNeto also utilizes Cloudflare Workers, which allows developers to build serverless functions that run on Cloudflare's network, closer to their users, to direct web traffic to specific origin servers. They are working on using it to simplify some of the caching elements in their platform so that they can move them to the edge.\n\n\"With Cloudflare, especially Workers, Neto has the capabilities that we need to be creative about how we solve problems,\" Hennessy remarks. \"It's also enabling us to simplify the complexity of our platform by pushing a lot of the custom things that we have built on the platform out to the edges, and do it in a very standardized and automated way.\"\n\n__Cloudflare offers a full gamut of solutions to ensure performance, resiliency, and security without a lot of effort on our part. Thanks to Cloudflare, we can be creative about how we serve our customers and solve problems.\"\n— Justin Hennessy, Vice President of Engineering__",

						"longDescription": "Upwork ($UPWK) is the leading online talent solution transforming professional staffing. Upwork empowers businesses with more flexible access to quality talent on demand. Through Upwork's matching technology and services, companies have access to a global pool of proven professionals so they can scale their teams dynamically to meet business needs. Upwork also provides professionals access to more opportunities. \n\nUpwork's mission is to create economic opportunities so people have better lives. The community of independent professionals working via Upwork spans many categories including software development, creative and design, finance and accounting, consulting, operations and customer support — over 8,000 skills are represented.\n\n## Upwork's challenge: Configure 150,000 URL redirects efficiently and accurately\n\nUpwork is the \"child\" of two separate freelance platforms: oDesk, founded in 2003, and Elance, founded in 1998. In 2013, the companies merged to create Elance-oDesk, then later rebranded as Upwork.\n\nThe rebranding coincided with a major platform upgrade that presented technical challenges. Among the most vexing was the task of redirecting approximately 150,000 URLs from the oDesk and Elance domains. \"Many of these URLs weren't being redirected, resulting in some visitors receiving errors,\" recalls Wilson Chong, Sr. Director of Reliability Engineering.\n\nThis situation was completely unacceptable from an SEO perspective and, more importantly, a user experience standpoint. \n\nThe job had to be done. Unfortunately, there was no easy way to implement such big changes to meet the deadline. It would have required hundreds of hours of manual work. Upwork knew they'd need to find some help. \n\n\"We were thinking we'd have to redirect all 150,000 URLs manually, one by one, which would have been nearly impossible,\" says Chong. \n\n## Upwork's solution: Use serverless to perform bulk redirects at scale\n\nTurning to Cloudflare for help was a natural step; Upwork's partnership with Cloudflare had begun early on for both companies. \"We were one of Cloudflare's early partners,\" recalls Chong. \"When I first joined Upwork 3.5 years ago, we were already using their CDN and DDoS protection, along with other products to speed up site performance. Given our long history of success with Cloudflare, we felt confident that they could provide us with a solution to our bulk redirect problem.\"  \n\nThe answer to Upwork's dilemma was Cloudflare's serverless platform, Cloudflare Workers — which empowered Upwork to complete its massive bulk redirect project quickly, efficiently, and accurately. Workers allows developers to deploy custom code to Cloudflare's network edge, using the programming languages they're already familiar with. \n\n\"It was so much better to be able to use JavaScript to do the work; it's much quicker,\" explains Chong. \"We would set up a test domain and set the rules, and once we verified them, we simply set up the same thing in Upwork's production domain. Having the ability to test the different domains and see errors before deploying things was very valuable.\"\n\nUsing Cloudflare Workers, the bulk redirect project was completed in about one-fifth of the time Chong estimates it would have taken for the team to do the work manually.\n\nIn addition to using Cloudflare Workers, Upwork utilizes a wide array of Cloudflare solutions to bolster reliability, performance, and security, including Load Balancing, WAF and Rate Limiting. Upwork can automate its configuration changes across these products via Cloudflare's robust API with Terraform support, further improving operational efficiency. \n\nChong was impressed with Cloudflare's full suite of integrated, easy-to-use solutions.\n\n\"Cloudflare is easier to configure and puts everything in one place. We just go into the portal, and it's all right there,\" says Chong. \"For example, we have a public-facing DNS that points to two distinct IPs. We just set it up in Cloudflare, and we don't have to worry about it. It's the same with the DDoS protection. I log into the portal, initiate the protection, and that's it.\" \n\nUpwork also benefits from the analytics tools provided by Cloudflare. \"The Firewall analytics dashboard enables us to see requests that trigger security events. This helps us to review our security posture regularly and ensure we're best protected against evolving threats. The GraphQL Analytics API is another really useful tool that we can use to query and retrieve exactly the data we need to build our own custom dashboards.\" says Chong\n\n\"Cloudflare isn't a typical partner,\" adds Chong. \"When I first joined Upwork, a lot of the features that Cloudflare has now didn't exist. As I provided feedback, Cloudflare implemented those features. I really appreciate that type of partnership.\"\n",

Learn how they use Cloudflare to mitigate DDoS attacks, deliver a highly performant website, and move business logic to the network edge.\n\n\n__Transcript__\n\n*Hi, we're Cloudflare. We're building one of the world's largest global cloud networks to help make the Internet faster, more secure and more reliable. Meet our customer BookMyShow. They've become India's largest ticketing platform thanks to its commitment to the customer experience and technological innovation.*\n\n__Viraj Patel, VP of Technology, BookMyShow:__ We are primarily a ticketing company. The numbers are really big. We have more than 60 million customers who are registered with us. There are around five billion screen views every month, 200 million tickets over the year. We think about what is the best for the customer. If we do not handle a customer's experience well, then they are not going to come back again. And BookMyShow is all about providing that experience.\n\n*As BookMyShow grew, so did the security threats it faced. That's when it turned to Cloudflare.*\n\n__Viraj:__ From a security point of view, we use more or less all the products and features that Cloudflare has. Cloudflare, today, plays the first level of defense for us.\n\n__Pranav Kapoor, DevOps Lead:__ One of the most interesting and \"aha\" moments was when we actually got a DDoS. And we were seeing traffic bursts up to 50 gigabits per second, 50 Gb per second. Usually we would go into panic mode and get downtime, but then all you got was an alert and we just checked it out and then we didn't have to do anything. We just sat there, looked at the traffic peak and then be in control.\n\n__Viraj:__ It just took less than a minute for Cloudflare to start blocking that traffic. Without Cloudflare we wouldn't have been able to easily manage this because even at a data center level, that kind of pipe — it's not easily available.\n\n__Pranav:__ We started with Cloudflare for security and I think that was the \"aha\" moment. We actually get more sleep now because a lot of the operational overhead is reduced.\n\n*With the attacks safely mitigated, BookMyShow found more ways to harness Cloudflare for better security, performance, and operational efficiency.*\n\n__Viraj:__ Once we came onboard the platform, we started seeing the advantage of the other functionalities and features. It was really, really easy to implement HTTP/2 when we decided to move towards that. Cloudflare Workers, which is the computing at the edge — we can move that business logic that we have written custom for our applications at the Cloudflare edge level.\n\n__Pranav:__ One of the most interesting things we liked about Cloudflare, was everything can be done by the API. Which makes almost zero manual work. That helps my team a lot because they don't really have to worry about what they're running, because they can see. They can run the test and then they know that they aren't gonna break anything.\n\n__Viraj:__ Our teams have been able to manage Cloudflare on their own for more or less anything and everything.\n\n*Cloudflare also empowers BookMyShow to manage its traffic across a complex, highly-performant global infrastructure.*\n\n__Viraj:__ We are running on, not only hybrid, we are running on hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Cloudflare is the entry point for our customers. Whether it is a cloud in the backend or it is our own data center in the backend. Cloudflare is always the first point of contact. \n\nWe do load balancing as well, as we have multiple data centers running, data center selection happens on Cloudflare. It also gives us fine-grain control on how much traffic we can push to which data center, depending upon what is happening in that data center and what is the capacity of that data center. We believe that our applications and our data centers should be closest to the customers. Cloudflare just provides us the right tools to do that.\n\n*With Cloudflare, BookMyShow has been able to improve its security, performance, reliability and operational efficiency. With customers like BookMyShow, and over 26 million other domains that trust Cloudflare with their security and performance, we're making the Internet fast, secure and reliable for everyone. Cloudflare, helping build a better Internet.*",

						"longDescription": "Throughout its successful, multi-decade long history, the confidential subject of this case study has always strived for advancing technology to address the needs of its consumers worldwide. \n\nIn a pivotal example of its commitment to innovation and growth, and to modernize its collaboration company-wide, the company successfully migrated to G Suite. In doing so, the company initially elected to rely on its existing information security infrastructure to keep the business safe from cyber threats. \n\nHowever, as technologies and industries evolve, the risk of cyberattacks that could lead to a data breach or system disruption also evolves - and increases. Particularly for an S&P 100 company that serves customers around the world, such attacks can inflict major operational downtime, brand harm, significant cost, and government investigations and fines. \n\n## Challenge\n\nThe information security team recognized that the most significant cyber risk is email-borne threats: it was time to prioritize a project to defend against these attacks. \n\nOf greatest concern were end users clicking on malicious links or falling for [business email compromise](/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) (BEC), with high potential for theft of funds and information. \n\nAlthough the company relied on industry-known email and web security technology to protect it from phishing attacks, the team found itself frequently \"tuning\" the security gateways and adding rules to block messages after attacks got through. Therefore, executives and end users worried their email was not secure. While the IT team can control software updates, they can't control which links end users click on or whether they fall for a BEC email. The team recognized the need for technology to better defend the company against malicious links and phishing attacks.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe company worked with Cloudflare to bring the attacks to a halt. Cloudflare's innovative technology continuously and proactively crawls the web, discovering phishing campaigns and infrastructure before attacks launch. On average, the solution detects malicious sites and payloads a full 24 days before industry benchmarks. The resulting early insight and threat information empowers Cloudflare's anti-phishing service to detect and block phish that other defenses miss, adding a layer of protection against attacks.  \n\nTo evaluate effectiveness, Cloudflare was deployed with the company's Gmail instance. The Cloudflare service is automated, operationally simple, and cloud-based, so it required no new on-site equipment. \n\nThe Cloudflare service successfully detected and blocked substantial numbers of phishing emails, including credential harvesting and BEC attacks. In one incident, an email sent to the CFO that appeared to be from the CEO, requesting a transfer of funds, was detected and blocked before it reached the CFO's inbox, averting potential financial loss. \n\nIn addition to protecting against phishing email, Cloudflare also includes a recursive DNS service that protects against web-based attacks. The company successfully deployed the Cloudflare recursive DNS service with their Windows DNS server to block end-user access to phishing sites. The Cloudflare service is updated hourly with newly discovered phishing domains to maximize protection.\n\nCloudflare is now operational company-wide, protecting this Fortune 500 leader against email and web-based phishing attacks. Over one year, the service processed 375 million email messages and stopped upwards of eight million targeted phishing attempts. The multitude of stopped attacks includes credential harvesting threats that spoof brands such as Outlook, Paypal, UPS, and Apple; links resolving to sites or files with malicious payloads; and email attachments with embedded malicious code or links. \n",

As the company has built major brands in the market such as CasinoTopp.net and CasinoTop.com, it has also made information security one of its top priorities.\n\n\"We are very serious about the online casino affiliate industry,\" says Reza Shojaei, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Value Marketing. \"Trustworthiness and reliability are paramount for any business, but especially in the iGaming market, which has inconsistent rules and regulations globally. Readers and players need to know that their information is safe.\"\n \n### __The Challenge__\n \nHowever, information security, while essential, was also part of a bigger set of challenges for Value Marketing. Reza explains, \"In parallel, we were facing performance issues. We tried different ways to optimize servers and the CMS we use for our websites, but loading speed on our website was slow. Our server team investigated and found there were many attacks on the admin portal. Even though our server was properly hardened to resist these attacks, we still faced distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\" Facing increasing pressure to keep their website running smoothly and rising complaints from their customers, Value Marketing knew it had to find a better solution.\n \n### __Cloudflare offers integrated security and performance solutions__\n \nValue Marketing evaluated different cloud platforms to help safeguard customer data and defend against future attacks, but Reza says, \"Frankly, Cloudflare was a clear choice, as we could see they prevent attacks and improve performance, trustworthiness, and efficiency.\"\n\nDuring their migration to Cloudflare services, Value Marketing started using Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Advanced DDoS Protection to head off any incoming attacks. The server team also implemented the Cloudflare Railgun solution to improve the connection between the server and the end-user through content compression without impact on quality.\n\nAfter turning to Cloudflare, Value Marketing noticed significant security and performance improvements across the board. According to Reza, \"All the attacks were blocked, server load decreased, and our websites started working smoothly.\" Other Cloudflare services also contributing to Value Marketing's success and growth include Argo Smart Routing, Argo Tunnel, Cache API, and DNS.\n \n\"Cloudflare, you are our saving grace!\"\n\nDelighted with all these advantages, Reza estimates that Cloudflare increases their server security to 99% or better, especially against DDoS attacks. \n",

						"longDescription": "[Udaan](https://udaan.com) is one of India's marquee entrepreneurial success stories. Founded by three former top executives of Flipkart (which was acquired by Walmart for $16 billion), Udaan has already established itself as India's largest business-to-business [e-commerce platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) — bringing together manufacturers, brands, white labels, traders, wholesalers and retailers who buy and sell everything from smartphones to fashion to fruits and vegetables. The platform facilitates efficient, transparent, and convenient transactions for its network of 3 million retailers in 900 cities, connecting them with 20,000 sellers across the country who offer a broad selection of high quality products at the best prices.\n\nFacilitating commerce for a population as large and diverse as India's is a gargantuan technological undertaking. Udaan has been responsively proactive about ensuring it has the foundation in place to meet its rapidly-rising demand — and Cloudflare plays a crucial role. \n\nAccording to Amod Malviya, co-founder of Udaan, \"We wanted to be oriented towards the future, so it was important to get these fundamentals right. We adopted Cloudflare early in our journey to ensure we have best-in-class security and performance, while minimizing our operational overhead — and Cloudflare has definitely delivered.\" \n\n\"We're huge fans of Cloudflare,\" Malviya adds. \"You won't find a bigger evangelist in India.\"\n\n__The Cloudflare Solution__\n\nUdaan first came to Cloudflare for its comprehensive security protection, including DDoS mitigation and Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall. \n\nCloudflare security products are powered by collective intelligence derived from millions of Internet properties on its network: insights gained from an attack against any one of these properties are used to better protect them all. That means Cloudflare's firewall is automatically updated to protect against the latest threats.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"We're growing extremely quickly, and from the beginning we've been prepared for potential attention from hostile actors. Cloudflare's network automatically absorbs attacks, so we don't even notice them — it definitely helps us rest easier at night.\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Amod Malviya</center>\n  <center>Co-founder, Udaan </i></center>\n</br>\n\nProtection from hostile attacks was just the beginning: as it explored Cloudflare's dashboard, Udaan discovered a range of additional enhancements to take advantage of. Cloudflare makes it easy to deploy features like Argo Smart Routing and next-generation protocols like HTTP2 with the flick of a switch — allowing Udaan to deliver these benefits to its millions of users with minimal effort.\n\n__Access: Enabled__\n\nOne of the biggest wins for Udaan's team has been Cloudflare Access, the zero trust solution for access management. \n\nCloudflare Access is a modern alternative to conventional VPNs. Instead of simply securing the perimeter of the network and trusting anything that makes it inside, as a VPN does — Cloudflare Access digitally interrogates every request from each user. And unlike VPNs, which are notorious for configuration headaches and unreliability, Cloudflare Access is frictionless and nearly invisible to the end-user (provided they have the appropriate credentials).\n\nBecause of their experiences with traditional VPNs, Udaan's founders knew they wanted a more robust, intuitive solution for access management. The team initially began developing its own authentication solution before adopting Cloudflare Access — but after a brief trial with Access, they quickly decided to go all-in with Cloudflare's solution. \n\nToday, Udaan has thousands of users secured with Cloudflare Access, spanning employees, interns, and third-party vendors — Udaan can configure and enforce access policies with granular control for each of them. Cloudflare Access also streamlines the process of onboarding contractors, obviating the need to enroll them in complex HR systems while maintaining a strong security posture that grants them limited permissions. \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"VPNs are frustrating and lead to countless wasted cycles for employees and the IT staff supporting them. Furthermore, conventional VPNs can lull people into a false sense of security. With Cloudflare Access, we have a far more reliable, intuitive, secure solution that operates on a per user, per access basis. I think of it as Authentication 2.0 — even 3.0\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Amod Malviya</center>\n  <center>Co-founder, Udaan </i></center>\n</br>\n\n__Solutions Without Tradeoffs__\n\nOne of the best things about Cloudflare is the fact that its security and performance products are designed to work in tandem, without the increase in latency that can be associated with layering multiple cloud services. And that's exactly what a platform experiencing explosive growth is looking for:\n\n\"Done right, technology is about eliminating tradeoffs — and Cloudflare is a classic example of how you can get both security and performance without compromising either. \n",

Their customers on the business-to-business side include recording artists, music retail outlets, and distributors. On the business-to-consumer side, they serve a wide variety of clientele, including fans of music and animation. While the core businesses of their entire organization are music and animation production and development, they also have IT departments which provide users with their own CMS creations and other departments which develop games and apps. Their website serves as a link between the end user and their artists and animation content, and it delivers a large amount of content (more than 400GB per month). They receive nearly 8 million requests per month and manage more than 500 websites.\n\n### __Security and performance are directly linked to user trust__\n\nSony Music Group (Japan) manages more than 500 different websites. This requires the handling of a lot of personal data, which requires strong security measures. Additionally, any noticeable drop in performance would damage the trust that their users place in them.\nWhile they originally delegated security concerns to the operators of each site, they soon realized that this led to inconsistent security policies across their properties. Asking the individual operators to implement these measures also increased their workloads and decentralized the line of communication for threat detection. They needed a solution for gateway security in multi-cloud and hybrid environments without getting locked in to a single cloud vendor. They needed to implement zero-trust security countermeasures for each environment, with rapid propagation against blocked threats. They also wanted a security vendor that could provide them with detailed daily reports. They ultimately chose Cloudflare to meet all of these needs.\n\n### __Sony Music Group (Japan) saw results almost immediately__\n\nOnce Sony Music Group (Japan) started using Cloudflare, they noticed results almost immediately. The Cloudflare WAF, which uses threat intelligence collected from data centers all over the world, was turned on for a set of their sites and was able to detect and prevent numerous attacks. The Cloudflare log monitoring platform provided a central point from which to observe the attack traffic across all of their sites.\n\nThe Cloudflare WAF was able to block over 400 attacks to one particular site over the course of a single day, while also improving that site's performance, which led to a more stable user experience and less time wasted dealing with these attacks.\n\nNow that they have seen the results of using Cloudflare WAF, Sony Music Group (Japan) is looking at enabling it across their network of sites, maximizing efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\n### __Cloudflare is an indispensable partner__\n\nWhile Sony Music Group (Japan) is solidifying these operations, they have been considering adding other Cloudflare services as well. They are particularly interested in Cloudflare Bot Management. The strength of Bot Management lies in its ability to evaluate and block not just basic bots that can be detected with conventional security tools, but also more sophisticated bots capable of elaborate attacks, like credit card fraud. Bot Management is able to score requests and stop bots thanks to machine learning and a behavioral analysis engine.\n\nHaving access to a global network is becoming more and more important as the world changes. For example, Sony Music Group (Japan) is working on initiatives like going paperless and facilitating remote work. Cloudflare will be an indispensable partner for these kinds of initiatives.\n",

The Düsseldorf-based media group was founded in 1946 and stands for well-founded, independent quality journalism. With its decision-maker media properties including *Handelsblatt* and *WirtschaftsWoche*, HMG reaches more than two million readers. HMG also serves large businesses through a variety of subsidiaries, offering marketing expertise, a corporate content agency, and more.\n\nAs a marquee media property, HMG regularly faces concerted online attacks from hostile actors — and before moving to Cloudflare, they were causing major issues. Over a span of several weeks, HMG was overwhelmed multiple times by online attacks that incapacitated its origin server, rendering the site inaccessible. \n\nTrust is paramount for news organizations, and erratic website reliability can quickly erode that trust. With no signs of the attacks abating, it was time for HMG to act.\n\n__The Cloudflare Difference__\n\nHMG's Digital Products & Development team evaluated a variety of cloud platforms as it looked for something that could not just mitigate these hostile attacks, but would also provide benefits to performance, reliability, operational efficiency — and cost. It quickly decided that Cloudflare was the clear choice. \n\nAfter a swift migration — with zero downtime — from a legacy cloud vendor, HMG enabled Cloudflare's web application firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection to thwart hostile actors, and its reliability issues immediately ceased. Informed by the collective intelligence of millions of properties on Cloudflare's network, Cloudflare's firewall is continuously and automatically updated against the latest threats, using insights from attacks on any one property to better protect them all. \n\nNow, the HMG team can focus on other priorities, like accelerating performance and finding ways to unlock more productivity from its team.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"We were looking for a provider that could stop our attackers in their tracks — and would also serve as the right partner to infuse innovation and efficiency into our organization. Cloudflare has delivered on that and more.\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Benedikt Geuer</center>\n  <center>Head of DevOps, Handelsblatt Media Group </i></center>\n</br>\n\nIndeed, the more it explored Cloudflare's platform, the more opportunities HMG saw to improve everything from its security and performance to its operational efficiency. \n\n__Powering A Digital Transformation__\n\nHMG is in the midst of fundamentally changing the way it approaches its digital strategy — which entails overhauling its infrastructure, and adapting its culture to thrive as it works to become a pioneer in digital publishing innovation.\n\nOne of the biggest wins for HMG has been Cloudflare's deep API support, which enables HMG to programmatically configure a wide array of Cloudflare products and features. The ability to define its infrastructure with code has empowered HMG to reduce dependencies, better leverage automation, and transition to a continuous deployment process that markedly accelerates its development pipeline.\n\nAnother major benefit stems from Cloudflare's position in the network stack, which allows it to work in tandem with — and manage policies across — any combination of on-premise and cloud infrastructure (in addition to SaaS apps). HMG still operates largely from on-premise servers, but it is in the process of embracing the public cloud — and it uses Cloudflare as an independent intermediary layer to tactically manage multiple clouds simultaneously.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Cloudflare is streamlining our migration from on-prem to the cloud. As we tap into various public cloud services, Cloudflare serves as our independent, unified point of control — giving us the strategic flexibility to choose the right cloud solution for the job, and the ability to easily make changes down the line.\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Dr. Isabel Wolters</center>\n  <center>Chief Technology Officer, Handelsblatt Media Group</I></center>\n</br>\n\n__Just the Beginning__\n\nHMG has even bigger ambitions as part of its digital transformation, and Cloudflare will continue to play a leading role. Cloudflare's Argo Smart Routing has contributed to a dramatic acceleration in the site's performance, dynamically routing visitor traffic around Internet congestion. And the HMG team is currently experimenting with Cloudflare Workers, the bleeding-edge serverless platform, to enable deeper personalization. \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Handelsblatt Media Group is working toward taking a pioneering role in digital media, and Cloudflare has been an invaluable partner in that.

Faster websites lead to higher conversion rates, and [eCommerce sites](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) must be secure to maintain consumer confidence and regulatory compliance. AllSaints turned to Cloudflare for both performance and security at a workable price point.\n\n[AllSaints](https://www.allsaints.com \"AllSaints\") is a leading British fashion retailer that's been selling high-quality men's and women's apparel, footwear, and accessories since 1994. The company is truly global, with over 200 brick-and-mortar stores worldwide in 27 countries — and many customers buy AllSaints products via its localized e-commerce platforms.\n\n### __Searching for faster performance and better tools__\n\nAllSaints was dissatisfied with its previous vendor. Despite paying premium prices, it was seeing minimal performance improvements. \"The CDN was incredibly expensive, and I don't think we got much out of it,\" says Andy Dean, Technical Operations Manager at AllSaints. \"We didn't see many performance gains, and it was a very limited toolset.\"\n\nAllSaints needed more than a CDN: it also needed a way to accelerate dynamic content (like customer shopping carts), and a way to bolster security to safeguard consumer confidence and ensure PCI and GDPR compliance.\n\n### __The Cloudflare difference__\n\nAllSaints looked at a number of CDN providers. None offered the simple pricing, the customization, the easy deployment, the tools, and the overall performance that Cloudflare offered.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"We wanted to get more than just a CDN. Initially that was the focus, but we also wanted to utilize other features like Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Argo Smart Routing. We wanted to push as much as we could off of our network, which was pretty constrained in terms of capacity.</b></center>\n<p></p>\n<center><b>Ultimately, we wanted more for our money. As it happened, we've paid less while getting more with Cloudflare.\"</b></center>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>- Andy Dean</center>\n  <center>Technical Operations Manager, AllSaints</i></center>\n</br>\n\nThe global footprint of the [Cloudflare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cdn/), which caches content in over %{DataCenterCount} data centers around the world, was crucial to the decision to deploy Cloudflare. \"We wanted to leverage the local Cloudflare PoPs,\" says Dean. \"We currently host our US website out of London, so making sure we had global points of presence with a CDN that could serve content more locally than London was a huge factor.\"\n\nOptimizing image delivery is also key, because AllSaints is unwilling to compromise on image quality for the sake of faster load times. \"The CDN is important for our high-resolution images,\" says Dean. \"When you're selling clothes, people want to look at the details, so we didn't want to scale down the quality of the images just to save on size.\" With the Cloudflare CDN, they're able to deliver images to customers much faster for a better experience that doesn't undercut content quality.\n\nAllSaints uses [Argo Smart Routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/) to further boost the performance of dynamic content that can't be cached. Argo uses Cloudflare's unique vantage point — evaluating traffic performance from over 16 million web properties — to route around network congestion.\n\nWith these technologies and the CDN packaged in their solution, performance is no longer a concern for AllSaints, even during times of high traffic: Dean notes that \"one of our quickest times was during Black Friday.\"\n\nSecurity is also essential for safeguarding consumer trust, which is why AllSaints leverages the [Cloudflare WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/) and [SSL services](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/ssl/) to secure their web properties. SSL ensures all pages are encrypted, not just checkout pages. The WAF enables AllSaints to not only block vulnerability exploits directed at its eCcommerce sites, but also to write its own custom rules to filter out undesirable traffic. While other vendors charged extra for security, Cloudflare includes it.\n\nThe Cloudflare WAF has blocked as many as 88,000 attacks on AllSaints in a 24-hour period. Additionally, it's easy for AllSaints to enforce SSL across all web properties from the Cloudflare dashboard. \"Being able to enforce strict SSL policies is really useful,\" says Dean. \"Obviously that helps with customer confidence as well.\"\n",

The task at hand for these fully digitized financial institutions is not easy: they need to deliver a smooth, secure, and flexible experience to their customers all over the world. \n\nWith the ever-increasing threat and sophistication of cyber attacks, the emphasis on security has become paramount for these new-age financial institutions. Any breach of security can drastically impact their business and unnerve customers.\n\n__The Challenge__\n\nSoFi, based out of San Francisco, is a well-known name in the world of online-first financial institutions. Started in 2011, they have revolutionized the way people borrow, spend, earn, and invest money. They have over 800,000 members and have funded over $40 billion in loans.\n\nFacing a constant threat from cyber attacks, SoFi's security team started looking for a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in 2018. They wanted an easy-to-use solution that not only blocked nefarious traffic but also became intelligent over time as new threats emerged. In the beginning, they tried some of the WAF solutions that their cloud providers offered; however, none of them were up to the task. Some lacked comprehensive features and rulesets, while others required a great deal of engineering effort to set up and maintain.\n\n<center><b>\"We tried a couple of different WAFs offered by major cloud providers, but they involved too much effort to maintain and involved a steep learning curve for our engineers.

Cloudflare's network across %{GlobalWebsiteCountWords} million internet properties acts as an immune system for the internet — learning from any attack on one property to better protect them all. With Cloudflare, SoFi is constantly protected against any new vulnerabilities that crop up on the Internet. \n\nUsing Cloudflare WAF, SoFi's engineers took almost no time to build and deploy granular rule sets and were able to reduce malicious traffic by over 60%, with a significantly low false-positive rate.\n\nSoFi was also able to add an additional layer of authentication for its international visitors by leveraging Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare's serverless development platform. Deploying a mobile validation solution at the network edge using Cloudflare Workers enabled SoFi to filter out malicious traffic that was spoofing their real users — without any compromise to performance. \n\n<center><b>\"What surprised us the most was that Cloudflare WAF was so easy and intuitive to use.

						"shortDescription": "Financial services firm SurePrep leverages Cloudflare to make load balancing less taxing.",
						"longDescription": "Since 2002, [SurePrep](https://sureprep.com \"SurePrep\") has specialized in the management and processing of complex tax data for both CPA firms and individual taxpayers. Over 20,000 tax professionals rely on SurePrep software, and their consumer-facing offering, TaxCaddy, is also rapidly gaining traction.\n\n__The Challenge__\n\nSurePrep products run on an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) deployment in the cloud. They were using load balancing to distribute traffic across their IaaS deployment. But like many businesses, SurePrep found that their cloud infrastructure couldn't keep up with company growth. They needed a new solution in order to avoid exceeding their bandwidth.\n\nIn addition, managing their load balancing was a labor intensive process, and they lacked personnel who could be dedicated to doing so. SurePrep wanted to use their internal resources more efficiently.\n\nSurePrep also needed a solution in place for automatic DDoS mitigation. Their mitigation strategy worked, but it was a mostly manual process.\n\n__The Cloudflare Solution__\n\nCloudflare turned out to be an ideal fit. Crucial to their decision to deploy Cloudflare was the Cloudflare-IBM partnership. SurePrep has to have all vendors approved by their customers because of the sensitive nature of the data they're handling. SurePrep already used the IBM IaaS offering, so deploying Cloudflare through IBM meant it was already approved and simple to deploy.\n\nCloudflare allowed SurePrep to set up load balancing with a few clicks. They found that using Cloudflare doesn't require deep technical knowledge and reduces the potential for human error. The intuitive Cloudflare dashboard vastly reduces time spent maintaining their infrastructure, freeing up engineering and IT time for more business-critical tasks.\n\n\"The idea of being able to abstract the engineering heavy lifting away from ourselves and interact with this as a platform was attractive,\" says Will Hosek, Chief Information Technology Officer at SurePrep. \"Our expectations there were definitely met – Cloudflare was exactly what we wanted.\"\n\nAside from load balancing, SurePrep was able to leverage other products from the suite of Cloudflare technologies, including the web application firewall (WAF), DDoS protection, Cloudflare Argo, and Cloudflare Workers — the serverless application platform that runs code at the edge.\n\n__Results__\n\nLoad balancing via Cloudflare is easier and more efficient than the previous solution used by SurePrep. Hosek says that, \"Through the load balancer, and during busy season, we were able to manage 35-40 web servers very effectively and very quickly without fear of messing things up, all through the Cloudflare interface.\" Hosek also notes that, while he used to handle load balancing himself, \"Now I can delegate load balancing to someone else and they can handle it easily.\"\n\nThe WAF makes blocking malicious bot traffic easier and faster as well. Hosek recounts one instance when Cloudflare helped SurePrep detect unusual bot activity attempting to access their web portal. Via Cloudflare's WAF, they were able to quickly set a rule blocking the region that the bot traffic was coming from, saving the time of having to identify and individually block the IP addresses involved. (Because the traffic was coming from outside the U.S. and SurePrep only assists with U.S. taxes, blocking a region outside the U.S. had no effect on legitimate SurePrep customers.) Just like that, the bot activity was blocked.\n\n\"We love Cloudflare Workers,\" says Hosek. \"The most important thing that we've done with Workers thus far is to manage some custom headers that needed to come in that our application expects from a legacy standpoint. Having to rewrite our application to handle the other headers would have been a huge effort. We used Workers to provide those custom headers instead.\" SurePrep writes Cloudflare Workers functions for a variety of other use cases as well.\n\nCloudflare Argo helps SurePrep route traffic faster. Customer traffic within the application goes back and forth from SurePrep's origin servers via HTTP requests, and with smart routing, HTTP traffic travels faster, resulting in a better customer experience.\n\nOverall, Cloudflare keeps SurePrep's servers better protected and less exposed than they would be otherwise. \"What provides peace of mind,\" says Hosek, \"is that Cloudflare minimizes our attack surface, because attackers have to go through Cloudflare's WAF, DDoS protection, and so on, before they ever get through to us.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "### __How RaiseDonors Uses Cloudflare to Safeguard Their Site During High-Traffic Events__\n\nWhen nonprofits need to raise funds online, they turn to RaiseDonors. For more than 18 years, organizations like Habitat for Humanity and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America have used RaiseDonors to provide a secure transaction pipeline for online donations. Every day, the platform hosts as many as 7,000 active donation pages, each collecting up to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nRaiseDonors uses Cloudflare to detect malicious bot activity and prevent it from impacting their platform. They also rely on the Cloudflare Content Delivery Network (CDN) and Argo Smart Routing to maintain fast page load times and overall performance. Together, these services help RaiseDonors provide seamless, safe donation experiences during high-traffic fundraising periods.\n\n__A donation crisis averted__\n\nAs a highly visible web application that deals with financial data, the RaiseDonors platform regularly faces attacks from malicious users. For this reason, RaiseDonors uses Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect its platform. During a recent Giving Tuesday—an high-traffic three-day event that is critical to RaiseDonors' business—the Cloudflare WAF blocked over 18,000 attacks.\n\nIn addition, RaiseDonors uses Cloudflare to achieve end-to-end SSL (TLS) for user-created donor pages, many of which live under those users' own domains. This achievement relies on the Cloudflare SSL for SaaS, which automates the process for purchasing, deploying, and managing SSL certificates for custom vanity domains.\n\nYet certain security threats require a more specialized response. \n\nOne such threat involves attackers attempting to use bots and other automated methods to test thousands of stolen credit card numbers on RaiseDonors-powered donation pages. Before Cloudflare, these attacks left the company with an impossible choice: permit fraudulent donations and expose users to tens of thousands of dollars in declined transaction fees, or implement broad access-blocking rules and risk losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in legitimate donations.\n\nThis time, RaiseDonors did not have to make that choice. Thanks to the Cloudflare API, RaiseDonors was able to create access IP rules on the fly that stopped incoming attacks after just 12 fake submissions. \n\n\"Cloudflare is a huge asset in helping RaiseDonors stay aware of new emerging threats and ensuring those threats are stopped before reaching our servers,\" says Chris Mechsner, RaiseDonors' co-founder. \n\n__Stronger platform performance and flexibility__\n\nHistorically, improving an Internet application's security has tended to hurt the speed at which it performs. But the RaiseDonors platform actually loads and functions faster than before, thanks to the robust Cloudflare Content Delivery Network (CDN)—which caches static content at the network edge—and to Argo Smart Routing, which intelligently routes traffic around network congestion.\n\n__\"Cloudflare Argo Smart Routing ensures that donors are routed to the donation resources in as few hops as possible, minimizing time-to-first-byte. Combined with the caching feature, this allows the donor to load the donation page 28 percent faster than our industry's average. The quick rendering helps with our conversion rates, which in turn helps our clients raise more dollars.\"__\n\n*-Chris Mechsner, Co-Founder, RaiseDonors*\n\nRaiseDonors also uses the Cloudflare network and routing capabilities to help its users run more creative and adaptable email campaigns. With Cloudflare Workers—serverless applications deployed to the network edge—the company can run A/B tests for its users and automatically direct traffic to different donation page variants.\n\nAnd, when a RaiseDonors customer accidentally sent an email with a broken donation page URL to five hundred thousand users, Mechsner was able to quickly create a one-off rule in Cloudflare that redirected traffic to the proper page.\n\n\"We could not have [rerouted our traffic] that easily if we were just using Azure,\" Mechsner says. \"It was a huge value add for our customer, and a huge value add for us—we were able to save the day.\"\n\n__Staying ahead of emerging threats__\n\nAs cybersecurity threats become more diverse and complex, so too does the process of defending against them. If an organization isn't careful, they can quickly find themselves using a dozen or more individual security tools, and devoting significant headcount to managing them.\n\nCloudflare allows RaiseDonors to cut through this complexity.\n\n\"I was not interested in a solution to our security and our scalability that involved more than two vendors,\" Mechsner says. \"Cloudflare sees a lot more traffic than I do, it sees a lot of the anomalies before anyone else, which is why it's always making real-time updates to its WAF ruleset and always releasing new feature sets. I don't see as frequent product releases anywhere in this space as I have with Cloudflare. I love that culture.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "If you're looking to grow your business online, there's no substitute for running objective tests to see how your website is performing. [Optimizely](https://optimizely.com \"Optimizely\") is one of the world's leading experimentation platforms — with thousands of customers including global brands like IBM, HP, and Microsoft — who cumulatively deliver billions of experiences every week.\n\nThese tests help Optimizely's customers improve everything from their website layout, to copy, to identifying which products have the most growth potential.\n\nOptimizely offers a straightforward, easy way to get up and running on its platform: simply drop its Javascript snippet into your website header. This approach has helped drive Optimizely's popularity — and has served its customers well. However, it comes with tradeoffs. \n\nBecause the Javascript is loaded in the website's header, it has to download and execute before the page itself can render. This typically happens so quickly that users don't notice a difference. But as Optimizely's customers add more and more tests to their pages, this Javascript can take longer to load. In other words, there's a tradeoff between how many tests Optimizely's customers can run, and the potential impact on performance.\n\n__The Cloudflare Difference__\n\nWhen Optimizely heard about Cloudflare's new [Workers platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/ \"Cloudflare Workers\"), it realized there was an opportunity to develop a robust new implementation of its experimentation platform — one that would still be easy for its customers to install, but that doesn't come with the same tradeoffs in performance.\n\nCloudflare Workers allows developers to leverage Cloudflare's global network — spanning over %{DataCenterCount} cities in 90 countries worldwide — to deploy and execute their own code, in the programming language of their choice. This allows developers to do everything from customizing Cloudflare's own products, to developing entirely new applications that perform complex logic at the network edge. \n\nWhen Optimizely's customers use this new, Workers-powered implementation of its experimentation platform, they can now concurrently run ten or even one hundred times as many tests without a noticeable impact on performance. That's because the test logic runs on the servers on Cloudflare's edge network, rather than in the user's browser. And because Cloudflare has servers within 100 milliseconds of 99% of the Internet-connected population in the developed world — those tests are blazing fast. \n\nWant more of the technical details? Learn more from our [joint blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/enhancing-optimizely-with-cloudflare-workers/ \"Cloudflare + Optimizely Blog Post\") and Optimizely's [press release](https://www.optimizely.com/company/press/optimizely-cloudflare-introduce-performance-edge/ \"Optimizely Performance Edge Launch Announcement\") announcing Performance Edge, powered by Cloudflare Workers.\n\n__Transcript__\n\nClaire Vo, SVP of Product: Optimizely is the world's leading experimentation platform. Our customers come to Optimizely, quite frankly, to grow their business.\n\nWhelan Boyd, Senior Product Manager: They are able to test all of their assumptions and make more decisions based on insights and data. \n\nClaire Vo: We serve some of the largest enterprises in the world, and those enterprises have quite high standards for the scalability and performance of the products that Optimizely is bringing into their organization. \n\nGreeshma Yellareddy, Senior Performance Engineer: We have a Javascript snippet that goes on customers' websites that executes all the experiments that they have configured, all the changes that they have configured for any of the experiments. \n\nLauren Pappone, Senior Software Engineer: That Javascript takes time to download, to parse, and also to execute and so customers have become increasingly performance conscious. \n\nClaire Vo: The reason we partnered with Cloudflare is to improve the performance aspects of some of our core experimentation products.\n\nWhelan Boyd: We needed a way to push this kind of decision making and computation out to the edge. And Workers ultimately surfaced as the no-brainer tool of choice there. \n\nLauren Pappone: Once we started using Workers it was really fast to get up to speed. It was like, \"Oh, I can just go into this playground and write Javascript which I totally know how to do — and then it just works. So that was pretty cool.\"\n\nWhelan Boyd: Our customers will be able to run 10x, 100x the number of experiments. And from our perspective that ultimately means they'll get more value out of it. And the business impact for our bottom line and our top line, will also start to mirror that as well. \n\nClaire Vo: Workers has allowed us to accelerate our product velocity around performance innovation which I'm very excited about. But that's just the beginning. There's a lot that Cloudflare is doing from a technology perspective that we're really excited to partner on so that we can bring our innovation to market faster. \n",

						"longDescription": "## __thredUP Bolsters Site Security With Cloudflare WAF__\n\nThe fashion marketplace is evolving. More consumers favor environmentally friendly brands, shop with the intent to resell rather than accumulate, and expect retailers to offer sustainably created clothing. [thredUP](https://thredup.com \"thredUP\") is the world's largest fashion resale marketplace, with 3+ million women's and kids' clothing items and 35,000+ brand names. Co-founded by CEO James Reinhart in 2009, the online reseller allows customers to shop ethically and easily while saving up to 90% on retail prices.\n\n__The Challenge__\n\nthredUP reinvented resale to help shoppers reduce their environmental footprint, but scaling their platform to support that vision came with challenges to tackle. As they evolved from a startup into a well-known retailer, their website began facing an increased number of exploratory attacks, some of which were targeted or massive in size. \n\nthredUP's engineering team had mitigation strategies in place that were successful in blocking the attacks, but they required expensive hardware and hours of engineering time to identify where attacks were coming from and how to stop them. That's when they tapped the Cloudflare WAF.\n\n__thredUP blocks threats with the Cloudflare WAF__\n\nCloudflare's industry-leading Web Application Firewall, or WAF, leverages collective intelligence from over %{GlobalWebsiteCountWords} million Internet properties to identify and defend against new security vulnerabilities. Cloudflare's network learns from every attack against any one of these properties to better protect them all — bolstering security for everyone.\n\nBefore deploying Cloudflare's firewall, thredUP would have had to expend considerable internal resources to create their own WAF rules from scratch and monitor every new threat aimed at their website. Now, the enterprise-grade security they receive from Cloudflare automatically and proactively defends them from incoming attacks.\n\n\"Deploying Cloudflare was a very smooth transition for us,\" said Roman Chepurnyi, Director of Infrastructure Engineering at thredUP. \"We were able to simulate the WAF and tweak the Page Rules as we rolled it out, making sure that each setting was optimized to fit our company's needs.\"\n\n__Cloudflare automation keeps thredUP fast and flexible__\n\nBecause they receive over 100,000 items every day, thredUP requires more than top-level security. They need a performant website backed by fast, flexible services that allow them to make changes on the fly.\n\nthredUP utilizes Cloudflare's global network to cache and serve content closer to their customers, minimizing latency and drastically reducing bandwidth consumption and costs. And the built-in capabilities of the Cloudflare API empower their software engineers and infrastructure team to refresh the cache on demand and apply the changes with Terraform — a huge benefit for a retailer that maintains an online inventory of 3+ million unique products.\n\nTerraform enables thredUP to provision their entire infrastructure on AWS while incorporating key Cloudflare resources for upgraded security, performance, and reliability. That seamless integration helps simplify a continuous delivery and deployment process as thredUP pushes changes to production up to a hundred times a day.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"thredUP is defined by scale and efficiency powered by cutting-edge technology and logistics.

						"longDescription": "## __Zerodha Chooses Cloudflare to Enable Security, Performance — and Financial Compliance__\n\nWhen Zerodha burst into the scene in 2010, it heralded a new era of discount broking in India. By 2019, the fintech company's disruptive pricing models and in-house technology had made it the biggest stock broker in the country by active retail clients, and the biggest by trading volumes on the top Indian stock exchanges. Today, over one million clients place millions of orders through its powerful ecosystem of investment platforms. Much of the action happens on Kite, its broking platform, which, to Zerodha, signals that technology is what keeps its clients coming back. \n\nFor Chief Technology Officer Dr Kailash Nadh and his team, this translates into the heavy responsibility of ensuring that Zerodha delivers the web performance and cyber security that its clients demand and deserve. Considering the frequency and sophistication of today's cyber threats, tightening regulatory controls, and growing user traffic, Zerodha turned to Cloudflare to achieve all its objectives in a fast, simple, and resource-efficient manner.  \n\n__From Black Box to True Transparency__\n\n\"Before Cloudflare, we had a traditional managed services setup with practically zero visibility into what was happening, which is quite common for Indian managed services. We had no dashboard access and everything was done over the phone. If we wanted to add a firewall rule, for example, we had to write in and wait. It was such a black box that we didn't even know if it was effective—we couldn't see anything beyond the occasional report!\" shared Dr Nadh. \"This may have been acceptable in our early days but we've grown and now it's just obsolete. We need solutions that are powerful and scalable, and a customer experience that is seamless and transparent. That's why we chose Cloudflare.\" \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Cloudflare is built by developers for developers. It is a deeply technical and sophisticated system wrapped in a smooth experience, the way enterprise offerings ought to be.\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Dr. Kailash Nadh</center>\n  <center>Chief Technology Officer, Zerodha</i></center>\n</br>\n\n__Securing the Future__\n\nBeing in the financial space and dealing with large transactions on a daily basis, cyber security is naturally a top priority for Zerodha. \n\n\"Cloudflare WAF has been very effective in thwarting attacks for us. In fact, compared to our previous WAF, Cloudflare seems to be more proactive. It captures even obscure cases and appears to be continuously improving as threats evolve,\" said Dr Nadh.\n\nIndeed it is: Cloudflare's security protection leverages collective intelligence derived from millions of Internet properties on its network. The insights from an attack on any one of these properties are automatically applied to better protect them all.\n\nThis is important to Zerodha because cybersecurity is also a regulatory requirement. In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Board of India released the Cyber Security & Cyber Resilience Framework for Stock Brokers/Depository Participants as an industry-wide call for stronger cyber defences. \n\n\"By the time the framework was released, we were already on Cloudflare, so that was a huge relief. The operational compliance burden is immense but, thankfully, just having Cloudflare allows us to tick off half of those boxes.\"  \n\nOn the web performance side of things, Dr Nadh is just as pleased with what he describes as \"incredible gains\" from Cloudflare's CDN and DNS products. \n\nToday, Zerodha uses Cloudflare's web application firewall (WAF) and advanced DDoS attack protection services to ramp up security, and the Cloudflare network and managed DNS service to achieve better speed and performance. \n\n\"Our previous CDN had Points of Presence (PoPs) across Asia, but not in India. Cloudflare has tons of PoPs here and that immediately made a huge difference. CDN performance jumped by at least 100%. We saw latency improvements in many states across the country and have saved about 80% of our bandwidth from heavy caching,\" he said. \"Cloudflare is beautifully built. It's completely technical and developer friendly, which makes it is a powerful engine for our business.\" \n",

The platform optimizes game discovery by giving gamers personalized recommendations based on the games they already like.\n\nPoki strives to ensure that all the games on its platform are instantly playable across the web. Download performance is a critical factor in keeping users coming back for more. Casper van Wezel, Head of Technology for Poki, says, \"We've found that loading times are directly correlated to the number of successful game plays. Fast-loading games lead to more game plays, which lead to happier users and better financial results.\"\n\n__The Challenge__\n\nBringing games as close as possible to users is a critical part of Poki's strategy. With 1.1 million hours of play per day and users playing in numerous native languages including German, Chinese and Turkish, Poki needs to satisfy a globally-distributed, high-traffic audience. Offloading the workload from its origin servers is essential, as is optimizing the transfer of images and dynamic game data. \n\nHowever, with its previous CDN provider, Poki was experiencing unresolved issues in edge communications with users. Determined to give both users and developers the best performance possible, Poki reviewed a panoply of CDN players to find the solution it needed.\n\n__The Cloudflare solution__\n\nPoki began leveraging Cloudflare's CDN service for its image and game files.

With [Cloudflare Image Resizing](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-cloudflare-image-resizing-simplifying-optimal-image-delivery/), Poki serves resized images that are optimized for each visitor's device, keeping images as lean as possible without compromising the user experience. \n\nDynamic game content that cannot be cached is served by Cloudflare's [Argo Smart Routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/). Casper van Wezel says, \"Our data shows that Cloudflare's Argo Smart Routing product outperforms competitors.\" The global Cloudflare network enables Argo to detect real-time congestion and route web traffic across the fastest and most reliable network paths, helping Poki optimize performance for  users everywhere. \n\n__Win-win for Poki and its gamers__\n\nPoki now sees significant download speed improvements thanks to the reliable, high-performance Cloudflare infrastructure and functionality. As Casper van Wezel says, \"Along with improving our existing US infrastructure, our users in South America are experiencing huge speed increases, because they are now served not with the cheapest edge location, but the fastest.\" \n\nPoki thus optimizes its website performance, which is vitally important for our user experience and for keeping users engaged and active.

						"longDescription": "What began as a chain of family-owned pharmacies eventually inspired a second-generation health food storefront, where customers could not only source quality organic products, but find valuable information to supplement their nutritional needs. In 2004, [LuckyVitamin](https://www.luckyvitamin.com/ \"LuckyVitamin\") founder and CEO Sam Wolf migrated the family business online to extend their reach even further.\n\nFifteen years later, LuckyVitamin has expanded to a global market of 50 countries worldwide, positioning themselves as industry leaders with over 37,000 nationally-labeled and in-house grocery, household, beauty, skincare, baby, and pet products. Convincing customers to make healthier choices was the easy part. Managing a thriving [e-commerce platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) that services hundreds of thousands of online shoppers was not. When it came time to migrate some of their physical hardware to the cloud, LuckyVitamin reached out to Cloudflare.\n\n__The Challenge__\n\nLuckyVitamin first ventured into the world of e-commerce in the early 2000s and found limited options to serve their global vision. Boxed in by bare-bones, closed-platform providers, they decided to build out their own on-premises infrastructure to keep up with the growing demand for their products.\n\nRapid growth was an exciting byproduct of the company's switch to online retail, but it also came with a host of additional problems. LuckyVitamin quickly realized they needed to make investments in global content delivery network (CDN), one that offered built-in protection against DDoS attacks and allowed them to fine-tune and leverage acceleration technologies to speed up their web properties. \n\n\"We had three separate solutions,\" said Wolf. \"We had an internal security product that was hardware-based; we had some web acceleration technology components and devices— again, hardware-based— through another party; lastly, we were leveraging a competitive CDN and were looking to consolidate these services into a single vendor.\" \n\nHardware solutions had worked well for LuckyVitamin during the early days of the Internet. But with the increasing need to scale their business and improve their customer experience, costly internal infrastructure could no longer match the affordability, scalability, and safeguards that comparable cloud-based solutions offered.\n\n__Cloud migration made easy with Cloudflare__\n\nWith Cloudflare, LuckyVitamin was able to take some of the burden off of their on-prem infrastructure and [optimize their performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) in the cloud. Cloudflare's extensive global network brought them closer to their customers and enabled them to improve network latency and site availability. Whether a marathon runner was shopping for natural supplements in Australia or a father was looking for teething biscuits for his daughter in Hungary, LuckyVitamin could guarantee that their customers' online shopping experiences would be fast and reliable.\n\nLuckyVitamin uses Cloudflare for CDN and additional security services like advanced DDoS attack protection, so they no longer had to fear unexpected   outages or unnecessary costs triggered by distributed attacks.\n\n\"As we've expanded more globally, that [has] opened us up to more security threats, so having strong protection sitting in front of the application has been really useful,\" Wolf added.\n\nCloudflare is a key fixture in Lucky Vitamin's hybrid cloud strategy, merging legacy on-premises infrastructure with cloud capabilities for added flexibility and protection, LuckyVitamin was able to integrate an expansive network with powerful security and serve their customers faster and better than ever.\n\n__LuckyVitamin expedites checkout experience with Argo__\n\nLuckyVitamin also deployed Argo Smart Routing to accelerate requests for dynamic content that cannot be cached. Users that need to access their shopping cart was a prime example, where they experienced a performance boost. A compilation of studies from the [Baymard Institute](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate \"Baymard Institute\") found that between 56 and 75% of all online shoppers abandoned their carts in 2018; [previous metrics](https://www.barilliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Opti-Reasons-for-Shopping-Cart-Abandonment-top-10-reasons.jpg \"previous metrics\") indicated that a combined 67% of those shoppers had done so because of the long checkout process, website errors, and concerns about payment security.\n\nLuckyVitamin couldn't afford to lose such a valuable percentage of their business. With Argo, they didn't have to - customers were able to easily complete the checkout process quickly and seamlessly, with no delays or interruption.\n",

Its seamless, end-to-end Software as a Service (SaaS) covers all aspects of digital media operations and has helped clients achieve up to 25X growth in page views. \n\nWith high-traffic portals like Fortune India, Bloomberg | Quint, and Vikatan relying on Quintype's content management ecosystem to deliver an engaging reader experience, performance is a top priority for Tejas Dinkar, the company's head of technology. \n\n\"Performance is incredibly important in the content space. For a typical content site, especially news, nearly 80% of your traffic will bounce if your page doesn't load within two seconds,\" he explained. \"We are able to deliver a sub-two-second page load time for most of our clients. While this is a result of many things, such as front-end engineering, it is undeniable that Cloudflare is a major contributor.\"\n\n__A Value-Driven Partnership__ \n\nWhen Quintype decided to switch from its former cloud service provider, it was looking for more than just a replacement. \n\n\"We wanted a partner who would not only help make our content available fast, but who would also scale with us as we grow. The Cloudflare team was very open about discussing what things would cost us at our current scale, and how this might change in a year, or even five years down the line as our needs evolve. Having such transparency was a refreshing change for us,\" said Tejas. \n\n\"Another major way in which Cloudflare adds value to us is through its inbuilt WAF protection. Companies usually charge a high price for this so, before Cloudflare, we had to run our own WAF servers on our network. We were relieved to get rid of that completely.\" \n\nQuintype also runs Cloudflare Workers, which helps it ensure that its cache hit ratio is as high as it could possibly be, as this in turn brings down its costs.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"With Cloudflare Workers, we saw dramatic improvements in our cache hit ratios. By short circuiting a lot of the traffic, we achieved major dollar savings on our infrastructure bill.\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Tejas Dinkar</center>\n  <center>Head of Technology, Quintype </i></center>\n</br>\n\n__Simple but Powerful__\n\nWith the Cloudflare network powered by data centres in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world, Quintype is assured of performance and reliability. The company also leverages Cloudflare's SSL for SaaS to swiftly issue SSL certificates via a robust API — no more manual provisioning via different dashboards.\n\n\"There are APIs that load user profiles when they log in. Because we use secure cookies, our cookies have to make calls to the server for authentication. With Cloudflare, we have been able to drop traffic from users who are not logged in. Scaling that down by almost 40% has saved us significant bandwidth,\" revealed Tejas. \n\n\"Overall, I would say that Cloudflare is very developer-friendly. It is simple but powerful, and continuously innovating. It keeps coming up with new products and improvements that we can actually use, and that creates real value. The support team is also fantastic and always available when we need them. We are delighted to have found a great partner in Cloudflare and look forward to a long-term relationship as we scale and grow.\" \n",

						"longDescription": "Digitally Imported (DI.FM) is an online radio destination for electronic music fans around the world. Founded in 1999 with a single channel, DI.FM today offers 90+ specialized channels via the Web, mobile applications and third-party streaming partners. Through a vast catalog of 100% human-curated electronic music, DI.FM ensures a superior listening experience with authenticity, originality, and depth. \n\n__The Challenge__\n\nDI.FM sought a global delivery and performance platform they could trust to reliably serve streaming media worldwide from their colocated origin servers. Further, they wanted to achieve this without paying high rates for storage, data transfer from their origin to their content delivery platform, and final distribution to end-users (many cloud vendors impose additional fees for each step in this pipeline).\n\nThis is where the [Bandwidth Alliance](https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/) came in: by pairing Backblaze's affordable and reliable object storage with Cloudflare's global cloud platform, including its best-in-class CDN, DI.FM found a path to a modern and resilient media streaming solution that integrates well with their hybrid infrastructure — while achieving major cost savings. \n\n__The Bandwidth Alliance Solution__\n![bandwidth alliance logo](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5wp4W2ZfsQ6y73H8AJZzP3/29c0fc83057158a529fc0c19a5bcff47/bandwidth_alliance_logo.png)\n\nStreaming media is at the core of DI.FM's business, and without a global cloud platform to handle distribution — their product doesn't work. They need a partner with transparent and predictable pricing and enough capacity to serve their global customer base. \n\nAs DI.FM initially evaluated potential partners, they optimized for a balance of pricing between their origin and CDN, and then again for the cost of transferring between the CDN's points of presence to end users. Many of the vendors DI.FM evaluated billed excessive rates for these transfers, used complex bundles to extract additional tolls, and lacked the global coverage DI.FM needed. \n\nThe Bandwidth Alliance proved to be the answer. By migrating to Cloudflare, DI.FM was immediately able to deliver content from Cloudflare's global network, spanning over %{DataCenterCount} cities in 90 countries worldwide. Now, listeners who previously had to deal with the latency of streaming content from remote servers are seeing a vastly improved experience, with tunein latency (the delay between pressing play and audio starting in their client) improving by as much as 300ms.\n\nIn addition to using Cloudflare to stream media and distribute its web content, DI.FM also leverages Cloudflare's robust security protection to keep DI.FM's site and APIs safe, including obfuscating the location of its origin servers.\n\nMeanwhile, DI.FM began using Backblaze's B2 storage, which is active object storage similar to AWS's S3 at a fraction of the cost. Because Backblaze and Cloudflare are both partners in the Bandwidth Alliance, they waive the egress fees that other cloud vendors typically charge — meaning that DI.FM doesn't have to pay to move its content from Backblaze's storage to Cloudflare's global network.\n\n\"DI.FM is poised to scale efficiently in line with growing demand thanks to the Bandwidth Alliance: storing content on Backblaze B2 — at only a 1/4th the cost of S3 — and moving it via Cloudflare's global delivery network with zero egress fees.\" said Nilay Patel, VP Sales, Backblaze\n\n__About the Bandwidth Alliance__\n\nThe data transfer fees charged by many cloud providers can be an integral part of your cloud hosting bill. Since cloud providers use their own global telecommunication backbone or use transit service providers to carry traffic, they incur infrastructure costs, which they pass on to their customers as data transfer fees.\n\nMost cloud providers that deliver traffic to users via Cloudflare share a presence with Cloudflare in the same data centers around the world. In these data centers traffic is transferred locally through a peering connection, minimizing infrastructure costs and transit charges.\nOur partners have agreed to pass on these cost savings to our joint customers by waiving or reducing data transfer charges.\n",

Retailers have responded in kind, and just about every retailer, large or small, now hosts an online storefront.\n\nCreating a storefront is the easy part; there are several turnkey solutions available that make it easy for anyone to sell their products online. Driving traffic to that storefront and [converting those visitors into customers](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) is far more challenging.\n\n__The Challenge__\n\nAutoAnything is based in San Diego, California and is one of America's fastest-growing [online retailers](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) of specialized automotive products. Founded in 1979, AutoAnything offers a wide array of products that enhance protection, comfort, safety, and performance of cars, trucks, SUVs, and vans.\n\nAutoAnything has always looked deeply into two sources of traffic - organic and direct traffic. While organic site traffic is important for measuring new, first-time customers arriving through search, direct traffic is especially valuable. Direct traffic represents visits from customers who know AutoAnything's brand and are returning to make a purchase. In 2018, AutoAnything noticed an inexplicable spike in direct traffic that resulted in significantly lower conversion rates. Something wasn't adding up.\n\n<center><b>\"Since the direct traffic arrives outside of a known referrer or advertising channel, it is the most impacted by bot activity. Direct traffic then rolls up into overall site traffic and impacts sitewide reporting. \"</b></center>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Marie Britt</center>\n  <center>Business Intelligence Analyst, AutoAnything</i></center>\n</br>\n\nAutoAnything discovered that their site was being targeted by malicious bots. This wasn't their first time dealing with malicious bot traffic. In 2018, they had experienced a large-scale bot attack and were able to mitigate this attack using Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF). However, this time around, these bots were imitating direct traffic and contaminating marketing analytics. The sheer volume of bot requests, especially on specific product pages, was invalidating crucial site analytics and degrading user experience with slow page loads.\n\n__The Cloudflare Solution__\n\nAutoAnything was able to remedy this problem using Cloudflare Bot Management. The automatic thresholds provided by our Bot Management solution helped them identify traffic from bad bots, enabling a more realistic analysis of their visitors' behavior. AutoAnything saw an immediate drop of 85% in malicious traffic and a ~4x increase in conversion rates. \n\n<center><b>\"Cloudflare Bot Management helped us clean up the direct traffic noise and improve conversion rates. We got a better sense of our visitors' behavior and the performance of various page types. Originally, we were reporting 76.6% of direct traffic arriving to one page type in particular.

Built with a mission to empower anyone interested in startups to find the right resources to succeed, AngelList aims to help startups raise funding, hire top talent, and launch their products to the world. AngelList's family of companies includes AngelList Talent, AngelList Venture, and Product Hunt, which collectively managed over $1 billion in assets, supported two million candidates in their job search, and helped makers launch over 20,000 products in 2018.\n\n__Challenge__\n\nThe value of any social network lies in the people who use and contribute to the platform. If the platform is instead inundated with fake accounts built using automated bots, then the core value proposition can be compromised. AngelList faced this exact challenge when an influx of bot-driven accounts began to flood the social network, threatening their revenue, user retention, and most importantly, their reputation. \n\nIn late 2018, product engineers at AngelList discovered that spambots were building fake profiles and scraping proprietary and valuable information that lives on AngelList: candidate resumes, startup and investor profiles, job listings, and more.\n\nAt first, AngelList tried solving this issue internally by building its own solution to identify fake accounts and stop malicious bot traffic. While they were successful in banning some of the bad bots, they knew a lot of malicious bots were still operating on their platform. Overall, the entire process turned out to be more time-consuming and resource-draining than they had anticipated. That's when AngelList learned that Cloudflare had a new product specifically designed to mitigate bot attacks.\n\n<center><b>\"Before Cloudflare, we relied on our in-house bot management solution but it was not very effective. We created certain thresholds to automatically ban users. However, we knew that we were missing a lot of users who were abusing our platform.\"</b></center>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Tony Bruess</center>\n  <center>Product Engineer, AngelList</i></center>\n</br>\n\n__Bot Management with Cloudflare__\n\nAngelList was able to easily deploy Cloudflare's bot management solution without the hassle of injecting JavaScript or other client-side code from their end. From day one, they have been able to quickly identify and mitigate bot traffic in real-time, with much greater accuracy. \n\nBy leveraging machine learning and behavioral analysis across the %{GlobalWebsiteCountWords} million Internet properties on its network, Cloudflare's bot management solution automatically scores every request that AngelList receives and sets thresholds to distinguish between threats and trusted sources. During the first month of its deployment, AngelList's domains issued 39 million CAPTCHAs to over half a million IP addresses. Only 0.0033% percent of these CAPTCHAs were false positives (issued to actual customers). \n\nUsing Cloudflare's bot protection technology, AngelList has experienced lower latency and faster performance, since the decision handling (the process of distinguishing between good and bad traffic) is supported at Cloudflare's edge instead of the origin. Additionally, AngelList has been able to integrate bot management with the complete suite of Cloudflare's performance and security portfolio — including Argo, DDoS mitigation, and diverse IP reputation database; thereby, strengthening their battle against malicious bots. \n\n<center><b>\"Using machine learning across tens of millions of websites, Cloudflare is able to immediately identify unauthorized bots that are abusing our website. Their mitigation strategies block bots without impacting real users - our false positive rate is as low as 0.003%.\"</b></center>\n<center><i>— Tony Bruess</center>\n  <center>Product Engineer, AngelList</i></center>\n</br>\n",

						"longDescription": "[Pippa](https://pippa.io \"pippa.io\") provides simple and smart solutions for podcasting, including hosting, analytics, and ads. In April 2019, Acast acquired Pippa to expand their suite of tools for podcast creators and brands. \n\nAcast is a future-thinking podcast company focused on providing compelling products and features for podcast creators. With their new, combined offering, it's even more important to ensure that Pippa has a scalable and robust infrastructure in place.\n\n__Challenges__\n\nThe most critical part of Pippa's business is rapid and reliable asset delivery. While Pippa's small team is based in New York, it has podcasters signing up all over the world — and these creators care just as much about their listeners in Jakarta or Djibouti as the Bay Area and NYC.\n\nPippa wanted to provide its customers with a fast and secure platform that ensures podcast listeners can immediately enjoy their favorite shows, from anywhere. As such, they needed a globally distributed network that would put their content as close as possible to their listeners. \n\nFurthermore, as Pippa grew, they were pushing millions of large audio files to listeners worldwide. This resulted in significantly increased costs, including excessive data egress fees for retrieving data from a cloud storage service such as AWS S3.\n\nThe Cloudflare [Bandwidth Alliance](https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/ \"Bandwidth Alliance\") has given them what they need to need to serve a huge volume of podcasts to users around the world — while keeping their costs in check.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"To deliver a global podcast service at the scale and speed listeners demand, the data transfer costs can become significant. The Bandwidth Alliance solves this both at a technical and financial level.\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Simon Marcus</center>\n  <center>prior CEO of Pippa, current Director of Product at Acast</i></center>\n</br>\n\n__The Bandwidth Alliance Solution__\n\nPippa chose Cloudflare for its global network, which spans over %{DataCenterCount} cities in 90 countries worldwide. Cloudflare improves Pippa's performance by closing the distance between its podcast customers and their listeners — while simultaneously reducing costs via the Bandwidth Alliance. Meanwhile, Pippa benefits from Cloudflare's robust security services, which defend it against large-scale DDoS attacks.\n\nAs a Techstars startup, Pippa had been introduced to Techstars alumni DigitalOcean through DigitalOcean's Hatch program, which helps developers create, launch, and scale their startups. The Pippa team decided to host their content using Spaces, DigitalOcean's offering of S3 compliant object storage at a lower price than Amazon S3. \n\nAs a member of the Bandwidth Alliance, DigitalOcean waives egress fees to transfer data to Cloudflare, effectively creating a zero-cost data bridge from DigitalOcean to Cloudflare's global network. With the combination of lower cost storage and zero egress fees, <strong>Pippa is currently seeing 50% savings on their cloud bill.</strong>\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"At DigitalOcean, our goal is to bring app development within technical and economic reach for developers around the world. By working with Cloudflare to pass along the benefits of our interconnected networks, we can better serve our mutual customers. We are proud to serve Pippa's storage needs with our high-quality global storage offering, Spaces, which enables them to more easily scale and grow their business,\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>— Jeff Giannetti</center>\n  <center>Chief Customer Officer at DigitalOcean</i></center>\n</br>\n\n\"From our perspective, the Bandwidth Alliance has been a significant technical win for Cloudflare and DigitalOcean, and a great business win for us at Pippa,\" said Simon.\n\n__About the Bandwidth Alliance:__\n\nData transfer fees charged by many cloud providers can be an integral part of your cloud hosting bill. Since cloud providers use their own global telecommunication backbone or transit service providers to carry traffic, they incur infrastructure costs, which they pass on to their customers as data transfer fees.\n\nMost cloud providers that deliver traffic to users via Cloudflare share a presence with Cloudflare in the same data centers around the world. In these data centers, traffic is transferred locally through a peering connection, minimizing infrastructure costs and transit charges.\n\nOur [Bandwidth Alliance](https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/ \"Bandwidth Alliance\") partners have agreed to pass on these cost savings to our joint customers by waiving or reducing data transfer charges.\n",

The same 2018 industry report, however, also reveals that consumers often turn to their friends, family, and colleagues as their top three sources of restaurant information, while restaurant guide websites and apps come in in fourth place. \n\nThis research nugget offers insights into the success of Thai Internet startup Wongnai.com, which combines all four information sources into one handy mobile app.  Wongnai, which means 'insider' in Thai, was founded in 2010 as a lifestyle platform featuring user-generated reviews of restaurants, spas, salons, hotels and attractions. With its credo of \"Connecting People to Good Stuff\", the mobile app offers quick searches of over 230,000 businesses, detailed user reviews for each, and a 'follow a friend' function that allows users to track their friends' consumer journey. \n\nThe app has taken off with Thailand's rising mobile penetration rate, which has quadrupled in the past decade, and now enjoys the attention of 2.5 million active users and 10 million avid social media followers. \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"To place lifestyle tips at our users' fingertips, we need to ensure high availability and fast loading times.

We've suffered a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS) attack before. It negatively impacted user experience and cost us significant time and resources to recover. That's not something we want to see happen again. After moving to Cloudflare, I'm happy to say that there have been similar attempts but they have all been successfully blocked,\" said Tanapol.  \n\nIt helps that Cloudflare's [advanced DDOS attack protection solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/) is supported by a network capacity that is 15 times bigger than the largest DDOS attack ever recorded, ensuring that it can handle any modern distributed attack including those targeting DNS infrastructure. With its network spread across data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world, Cloudflare also considerably improves Wongnai's performance. \n\n\"On the performance side, we are now caching more content and serving it to users about 20% faster than before. Cloudflare's local Points of Presence (PoP), spread all around the world, are definitely making a difference,\" added Tanapol. \n\n\"Cloudflare wins on its smart and scalable solutions, as well as its impressive customer support. Unlike local partners whose support desks operate on office hours, Cloudflare gives us round-the-clock support via its teams in Singapore, London, and San Francisco. I'm confident that Cloudflare will continue to be a valuable business partner to Wongnai as we continue to grow.\" \n",

The company operates a portfolio of well-known brands such as lastminute.com, Volagratis, Rumbo, weg.de, Bravofly, Jetcost and Hotelscan, each with its consumer website in multiple languages and own security and performance needs with a total combined traffic that exceeds 60 million unique visitors a month.\n\nEvery day, over 23,000 passengers rely on lastminute.com for their travel arrangements. Its sites need to stay online and performant 24/7, and its team must remain vigilant of competitors trying to scrape for business intelligence data.\n\n__The Challenge__\n\nlastminute.com was being overwhelmed by bot attacks. This came both in the form of bot traffic, which was ruining analytics, and scraper bots mining its sites for pricing and availability data. Much of the challenge stemmed from the fact that lastminute.com's web application security was being served by its CDN provider, through a third-party service. \n\nHaving to go to a third-party for its security needs added an unnecessary layer of complexity and obfuscation. It was not easy for lastminute.com's team to discern when they were under attack, nor what the extent of the attack was. Protecting new sites, as well as monitoring and customizing the protection of its existing sites, was more complicated than it needed to be.

But this is not your typical department store mainstay: Glossier is a digital-first company that generates considerable revenue through online sales — propelled by an ever-growing library of content featuring ways customers are using its products to enhance their personal style.\n\nThat combination has struck a chord, but it wouldn't resonate long if Glossier's web presence wasn't keeping up with demand. To ensure its performance and security keeps pace with its rapidly-expanding audience, Glossier turned to Cloudflare.\n\nGlossier Director of Engineering Aaron Suggs explains:\n\n<center><i>\n\"Cloudflare was the easiest way to get everything we were looking for, from global points of presence, to speeding up network traffic around the world, to absorbing potential DDoS attacks. Beyond that, we thought about the user experience for our engineering team — and Cloudflare stood above the rest.\"</i>\n</center>\n\n## Beauty at the Speed of Light\n\nGlossier's focus on performance isn't just about the practical realities of running a modern [ecommerce business](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/), where every hiccup of latency can translate into lost revenue. Instead, it stems from the company's core promise: Glossier strives to fit seamlessly into people's lives, and sluggish and unreliable load times would be the antithesis of that ideal.\n\nTo ensure its customers have a seamless browsing experience, Glossier taps into the bevy of acceleration features enabled by Cloudflare's network. With Argo Smart Routing, Glossier's content takes the most efficient route across the global Internet — informed by the intelligence Cloudflare derives from the millions of requests that pass through its network every second.\n\nGlossier also leverages Cloudflare's network to ensure its web properties are available and reliable worldwide. The company has focused its efforts in North America and Europe to date, but many of its customers are frequent travelers who shop while they're on the go — whether they're vacationing in Japan or on a business trip to India. With Cloudflare, that's no problem: Cloudflare's global network has data centers in %{DataCenterCount} cities worldwide, providing Glossier with a [low-latency footprint](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) wherever its customers are.\n\n## Safeguarding Customer Trust\n\nGlossier's brand ethos also explains why it thinks so much about security. Glossier is fundamentally a company that revolves around trust — which is crucial to its mission of connecting with and empowering customers. Meanwhile it faces attacks common to any popular retailer; attacks with the potential to undermine that trust. \n\nThat's why Glossier employs Cloudflare's robust suite of security features, like its Web Application Firewall — harnessing the massive scale of Cloudflare's network to evaluate and identify malicious traffic in real-time. DDoS Mitigation ensures Glossier's storefront stays reliable even in the face of concerted attacks. And with Cloudflare's industry-leading Bot Management, Glossier detects and thwarts malicious bots that masquerade as real customers.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Cloudflare has made us more resilient to whole classes of security threats, blocking everything from DDoS attacks to bots attempting to stuff credentials and scrape content.</b></center>\n<p></p>\n<center><b>I'm very bullish on Cloudflare's ability to identify threats — because of the volume and diversity of Internet traffic they handle, they're positioned to leverage that data to detect and mitigate the most sophisticated DDoS and malicious bot attacks.\"</b></center>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>- Aaron Suggs </center>\n  <center>Director of Engineering, Glossier</i></center>\n</br>\n\nFrom ensuring a world-class shopping experience to safeguarding consumer trust, Glossier shows why building the world's next-generation beauty company isn't simply a matter of aesthetics — and Cloudflare is proud to be helping them on their journey.\n\n---\n\nFor more on Glossier, don't miss their online storefront [here](https://www.glossier.com/ \"Glossier\").\n\nTo learn more about Cloudflare features like Argo Smart Routing, visit our homepage [here](https://cloudflare.com/ \"Cloudflare\").\n",

The server offers unique, revenue-balancing UX technology and full compliance with IAB and Google's SEO and ad quality guidelines. \n\nAs part of its aim to improve impression quality and trust in the programmatic advertising industry, Sulvo recently moved its platform to Cloudflare, enabling it to take advantage of Cloudflare's powerful security features, including industry-leading [Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/).\n\n## Background\nWhile programmatic advertising allows publishers to monetize traffic by selling ad space, advertisers are not only buying impressions — they are also buying trust. Trust that an impression is an actual visitor, and not a bot, is critical to advertisers and publishers and for the long term health of the industry. \n\n## The Problem\nAccording to most reports, bad bots account for a significant portion of the traffic routed across the Internet. This represents a real problem for publishers aiming to sell quality impressions, advertisers aiming to buy human impressions, and an entire industry that has fixed per-impression costs regardless of traffic type. \n\nAdvertisers end up having to build lowered pricing into their buying strategies to account for bot traffic, and also must absorb any other fixed per-impression costs. Publishers are paying to serve pages and ads to visitors that are not real, risking future ad earnings if their bot traffic increases — a threat that they have little control over.\n\nSulvo has been working to find solutions to this issue for over 2 years, with results that were usually too slow for the requirements of the programmatic media industry. \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Before using Cloudflare we were simply in the dark, we had no idea about the percentage of bots our infrastructure was receiving or if we needed to take action to protect our publisher partners' interests against malicious traffic.\"</b></center>\n<p></p>\n<center><i>- Romeo Ju</center>\n  <center>President, Sulvo</i></center>\n</br>\n\n## The Cloudflare Solution\n\nIt was not until partnering with Cloudflare that Sulvo found a viable solution that did not negatively impact user experience and would be able to respond fast enough for use within programmatic auctions for digital media. Based on their experiments, Cloudflare's bot management solution performs 100-300% faster than alternatives, making it the clear choice in these scenarios. \n\nCloudflare enables these benefits with technical simplicity, as publishers don't need to add additional tags to their pages.\n\nUsing Cloudflare's bot-protection technology, Sulvo has been able to improve the integrity of the programmatic advertising industry, bringing more confidence from advertisers by utilizing the Sulvo ad server. Finding the right balance in scanning billions of impressions for bots without impacting UX, identifying bots correctly, lowering bot ad traffic, and using this data to lower invalid activity risk, is not something either company could have done alone. \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Cloudflare's bot blocking has improved our reputation as an enterprise ad server both in the eyes of programmatic advertisers and in the eyes of the digital media publishers — essentially making us stronger on both sides of the marketplace.</b></center>\n<p></p>\n<center><b>The numbers speak for themselves: we've seen an over 100% increase in decisioning speed and an average of 50% reduction on invalid activity for the sellers.\"</b></center>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>- Romeo Ju</center>\n  <center>President, Sulvo</i></center>\n</br>\n",

NiceHash is the largest hash power broker marketplace, connecting sellers (or miners) with buyers of hash power. \n\nWhile NiceHash itself does not own or rent out any mining infrastructure, it acts as a broker to connect sellers and buyers of hash power. \n\n\"We're like the AirBnB or Uber of hash power,\" Denis Tomasevic, Head of Infrastructure and Security explains. Having this unique \"sharing economy\" approach on the market, NiceHash serves as an important part of the nascent cryptocurrency industry and allows an easy off-ramp for everyone who would like to start mining and earn cryptocurrencies in the process.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe side-effect of the near-overnight explosion of interest in the cryptocurrency industry was that cryptocurrency platforms, such as NiceHash, became targets to DDoS attacks.\n\n\"As soon as we launched our platform, we started seeing near constant DDoS attacks,\" Denis says. \n\nNiceHash was already using Cloudflare to safeguard their website and web sockets, so their web assets successfully resisted DDoS attempts and had 100% uptime. The same could not be said about their mining service. Frequent volumetric DDoS attacks that followed the launch of their mining service led to NiceHash looking to extend DDoS mitigation to all their critical communication protocols.\n\n\"Our mining service that connects buyers and sellers of hash power runs on a custom TCP communication protocol. We had implemented best-practice mitigations on local infrastructure that resisted occasional DoS attempts. But we were not prepared for the frequent and high-volume DDoS attack that followed our launch,\" explained Denis.\n\n## The Cloudflare Solution\n\nWhen a volumetric DDoS attack brought their service down for nearly 10 hours, it was time to act. Having their critical revenue-generating application go down for a significant amount of time led NiceHash to look for a solution to safeguard all their bases, not just their web assets.\n\nCloudflare Spectrum was just the answer to NiceHash's needs. Spectrum extends Cloudflare's industry-leading DDoS mitigation to all services that run over TCP/UDP. When NiceHash moved their mining services running over TCP behind Spectrum, they instantly observed drastically improved uptime of their service. Better yet, the performance of their application was not impaired.\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Our biggest consideration for a DDoS mitigation solution for our TCP protocol was to ensure the end-to-end latency was not impaired. With Spectrum, there is very minimal added latency, if at all, and that is really beneficial to us.\"\n</b></center>\n<center><i>Denis Tomasevic</center> \n  <center>Head of Infrastructure and Security, NiceHash </i> </center>\n\nWith Cloudflare, NiceHash today protects and accelerates their web assets as well as their critical revenue-generating TCP protocol.\n",

For this reason, surplus latency needs to be curbed at every step of the data's journey, maintaining privately provisioned infrastructure whenever possible. \n\nBefore activating Cloudflare Spectrum, Shift was struggling with connectivity issues for some of its globally distributed clientele. Protecting and accelerating these connections proved challenging, because Shift's technology operates over a variety of proprietary protocols.\n\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Even with our production systems hosted in a sophisticated hybrid deployment with dedicated cross-connects between our global data centers and one of the largest cloud providers in the world, connectivity was still not where we wanted it to be.</b></center>\n<p></p>\n<center><b>Hosting our own network of proxy servers was a huge investment, both in terms of cost and maintenance, and couldn't possibly compete with Cloudflare's unparalleled global footprint. There really are no other general-purpose solutions in the market offering a global TCP-level proxy service.\"</b></center>\n</b></center>\n<center><i>- Anthony DiSanti</center>\n  <center>CTO, Shift Markets </i></center>\n</br>\n\n## The Cloudflare Difference\n\nWhat makes Cloudflare Spectrum unique is the breadth of protocols it protects. Unlike other security services that generally focus on web traffic, Spectrum is designed to protect and accelerate all kinds of TCP traffic — including custom protocols. Spectrum can even safeguard the connection using TLS 1.3 with zero-round trip resumption support, enabling fast and secure transit. \n\nThis suited Shift's needs perfectly: by routing TCP traffic through Spectrum, Shift was able to safeguard its production systems from DDoS attacks, while simultaneously ensuring reliability and faster connectivity. After activating Spectrum, Shift saw an immediate reduction of over 50% in latencies from certain regions, with especially large improvements on Kuwaiti mobile networks and throughout rural Malaysia.  \n\nBetter yet, Spectrum comes with built-in WAF functionality, including support for custom security rules. \"It's extremely helpful to have a fully integrated WAF. It provides us unparalleled flexibility and protection on our proprietary trading protocols\" says Anthony. All told, more than 5TB per month of Shift's data is encrypted, protected and accelerated by Cloudflare. \n\nSpectrum empowers Shift Markets to deliver their services to their customers in a faster, more reliable way.\n\n\"After more than two years searching for a solution to our connectivity and security issues, I can confidently say that Spectrum offers an unprecedented level of reliability, security, and flexibility for proprietary protocols.\"\n",

						"longDescription": "Turtle Entertainment Online, Inc. (TEO) is part of [ESL](https://about.eslgaming.com/ \"ESL\"), the world's largest esports company. ESL produces the most popular online and offline gaming competitions, including arena-filled events broadcast live to millions of fans. [ESEA](https://play.esea.net/ \"ESEA\"), a subsidiary brand of TEO, has nearly 2.5 million global users, and is an industry leader in esports software security and anti-cheat, as well as a leader in competitive Counter-Strike: Global Offensive matchmaking and league play.\n\n## The challenge\n\nThe gaming industry is often subject to some of the largest volumetric DDoS attacks — and as marquee brand, TEO attracts more than its fair share. The risks are considerable: the industry is incredibly competitive and any service downtime could result in an exodus of gamers, leading the platform to lose its edge in the market. \n\nAdditionally, with a growing globally distributed user base, TEO detected that some of its users in remote parts of the globe were encountering slow page load times and poor user experiences. \n\nFurther complicating matters is the fact that some of ESEA's critical infrastructure operates over a proprietary network protocol, designed for the low-latency demands of gamers. When it comes to DDoS attacks, conventional security products wouldn't be able to safeguard these custom protocols. \n\nBen Burns, Chief Information Officer of TEO explained, \"It's important for us to continue to be the best in our industry, while also staying lean in our operations.\" It was clear that TEO and ESEA needed a robust security mechanism to shield its services from DDoS attacks, while also accelerating web performance. They needed a platform that could do both: Security and Performance.\n\nBen elaborates, \"As we grew and expanded our services, we got to thinking: how can we increase our robustness and resilience for all of our critical infrastructure from a risk mitigation perspective?\"\n\nThey turned to Cloudflare. As the industry leader in DDoS mitigation and accelerating application performance, Cloudflare was the clear choice.\n\n## DDoS Protection for custom game protocols\nCloudflare's Spectrum was just what TEO was looking for. Spectrum leverages Cloudflare's vast [global network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) to extend DDoS mitigation to all services that run over TCP/UDP - and this includes protection for custom TCP/UDP protocols - without impairing end-to-end performance.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"We wanted to ensure we have a high-quality Cloudflare level of protection to protect our critical communication protocol, and Cloudflare Spectrum helped us really boost the performance and resiliency of our custom TCP protocols. With other providers, it takes more than 30 seconds to a minute before scrubbing or mitigation takes place. Using Spectrum, it's much faster.</b></center>\n<p></p>\n<center><b>Having prior experience with Cloudflare's products, and knowing that we're able to really mitigate the attack without any impact to our customers, business, and infrastructure gives us another level of peace of mind.\"</b></center> \n<p></p>\n\n<center><i>- Ben Burns</center>\n  <center>Chief Information Officer, TEO</i></center>\n</br>\n\n## 70% faster page load times\nTo address the problem of slow page load times for gamers in remote parts of the world, TEO employed Argo Smart Routing. \"We were noticing that load times and round trip times for our web assets would take 1-2 seconds for a page to load,\" Ben related.\n\nWith Argo Smart Routing enabled, the ESEA website saw its average Time to First Byte (TTFB) decrease by more than 50% globally. In some cases, page download speeds improved by 70%. \n\n\"Our customers deserve the best connectivity to our services from wherever on the planet they are. The benefits Argo provided were really eye-opening and it just made sense for us to use it.\"\n\n## Credential Stuffing and Content Scraping? Game Over.\nAnother challenge TEO had was credential stuffing and content scraping on its websites, including ESEA. Lots of malicious requests flooded TEO's websites in attempts to scrape and manipulate data. \n\nWhen TEO activated Cloudflare Bot Management on the ESEA website, it was able to quickly and easily block malicious bots. \"Cloudflare Bot Management really helped us out from not only an intelligence perspective — by giving us insights on what bots are touching our environment — but all the way down to being able to take action, like implementing rate limiting, challenges, and other firewall rules. \n\nOn top of that, it's not just about blocking some curl requests or a simple headless bot. It's also about being able to detect Selenium, headless Chrome and other things that most other traditional off-the-shelf tools would not be able to.\" Ben explained.\n\n## Ease-of-use\nTEO uses Cloudflare's suite of performance and security products to ensure 100% uptime and optimize the delivery of its brands and services to customers. Better yet, they're able to do this with minimal configuration at their end. \n\n\"As a CIO, it's important for me to get into the trenches with our engineering teams when needed. Cloudflare's products help our teams clear tasks off their boards because they're so easy to use,\" Ben commented.\n",

We're building one of the world's largest Global Cloud Networks to help make the Internet faster, more secure, and more reliable.* \n\n*Meet our customer, Falabella. They are South America's largest department store chain - with over a hundred locations and operations in over six countries.*\n\nSantiago Lira: I am a Development Manager for Falabella.com. Within my responsibilities it falls to continually improve all technology platforms. \n\nKaran Tewari: My name is Karan Tewari. I work as a lead architect in ADESSA eCommerce at Falabella.\n\n*Like many other retailers in the industry, Falabella is in the midst of a digital transformation to evolve their business culture to maintain their competitive advantage and to better serve their customers.*\n\nSantiago: We have a store legacy that we have to adapt to the digital culture. A logistics legacy, an operations legacy — a legacy that works very well in-store and has performed splendidly, but the challenge now is to transform it.  \n\n*Cloudflare was an important step towards not only accelerating their website properties but also increasing their organization's operational efficiencies and agility.*\n\nSantiago: Then, the question of Cloudflare for example, it was not only an IT decision, it was also a business decision. In other words, how much faster can we deliver data to our clients? How much faster, how much less time and loading seconds can we improve for our site? It means internalizing it as a business metric. That is, to really understand later that performance, or that one second in the time a page loads, are sales. In other words, a loss in terms of client data means a loss of confidence.\n\nKaran: So I think we are looking at better agility, better response time in terms of support. Better operational capabilities. Earlier for a cache purge it used to take around two hours. Today it takes around 20 milliseconds, 30 milliseconds to do a cache purge. Our homepage loads faster, your first view is much faster. It's fast. \n\n*Cloudflare plays an important role in safeguarding customer information and improving the efficiencies of all of their web properties.* \n\nSantiago: Cloudflare, for me, is the perfect example of how to deliver value to clients quickly. The big challenge now is to build the culture and lay the foundation to allow the teams or whomever do their job for the next 5 or 10 years. \n\n*With customers like Falabella -- and over %{GlobalWebsiteCountWords} million other domains that trust Cloudflare with their security and performance -- we're making the Internet fast, secure, and reliable for everyone. Cloudflare: Helping build a better Internet.*\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Why Auto Trader UK Chose Cloudflare For Its Cloud Migration__\n\nIt's a challenge familiar to any longstanding business with an IT department: how to transition from their current physical, data center-based hardware infrastructure to the next-generation — implemented and maintained in the cloud.\n\n[Auto Trader](https://autotrader.co.uk \"Auto Trader\") — the largest automobile classifieds service in the United Kingdom and Ireland — recently decided it was time to make that crucial migration. The company's site offers an array of services, including key information on vehicle valuation and seller reputation. It also hosts over 3,000 custom websites for local dealerships across the UK, who rely on Auto Trader to maintain their online presence. \n\nAll told, Auto Trader sees over 55 million visits to its platform every month. With over 10 million transactions completed annually and £330 million in revenue, in addition to the thousands of dealerships relying on its platform — this migration to the cloud was an undertaking with high stakes and little margin for error.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nAs it looked to switch these mission-critical services to Cloudflare, Auto Trader's stack consisted of multiple differing technologies which included: PowerDNS (on-premises DNS), Verisign DNS (key external domains), Arbor (DDoS defence), and F5 (load balancing / WAF).\n\nUtilising a variety of different products had downsides including a lack of API access or support for automation, necessitating workarounds and repetitive work. This increased complexity which made tasks more difficult than required — and Auto Trader had to buy each individual product for their specific use case.\n\nAuto Trader Systems Engineer Mark Bell adds: \"We wanted something that would combine all of our DNS, performance, and security needs into a single unified interface\".\n\n## The Cloudflare Difference\n\nWith Cloudflare, all of these products are included in the same service, managed from a single integrated dashboard. That translates to major savings in overhead — no more hardware to maintain — and a user experience that's vastly easier to navigate.\n\nCloudflare was one of several options Auto Trader considered: \"We believe in performing as much due diligence as possible and as part of this we looked at the various offerings available in the marketplace,\" Bell says. And after extensive research and internal discussion, there was a clear winner.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\"There was only one decision to make, really: it was to go with Cloudflare, because you're so far ahead of the competition in regards to the capabilities and the features that you offer. And also, the support — with things like live chat, it's been very effective and really helpful.\"</b></center>\n<center><i>- Mark Bell</center>\n  <center>Systems Engineer, Auto Trader</i></center>\n</br>\n\nAuto Trader was also drawn to Cloudflare's flexibility, with extensive API support for automation tasks and the [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/) platform to build out custom functionality. It also was keen to take advantage of the extensive cost savings afforded by the switch.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\"A key consideration was cost, and we believe Cloudflare are very competitive for the service that they offer in comparison with other providers. Another attraction was the interconnect program between Google Cloud and Cloudflare — which offers up to 75% savings on egress costs.\"</b></center>\n<center><i>- Mark Bell</center>\n  <center>Systems Engineer, Auto Trader</i></center>\n</br>\n\nAlong with the convenience of a cloud-based solution, Auto Trader has seen marked improvements in performance: its previous DNS provider Verisign averaged 20-25ms of latency — with Cloudflare, that's fallen to just 10-13ms — an improvement of 50%.\n\n![DNS Latency - Auto Trader - Lower is Better](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1mxAPYfQamD7VBV0ZEaxun/64ba093e164b9402cb57bfd4e9f8bdfa/DNS_Latency_-_Auto_Trader_-_Lower_is_Better.png)\n\nSecurity has also been a vital component to Auto Trader's migration, which leverages Cloudflare's WAF — powered by the collective intelligence of millions of Internet properties on Cloudflare's network — to defend against hostile actors.\n\nBy migrating from its on-premises infrastructure to Cloudflare, Auto Trader has been able to accelerate its site performance, thwart hostile actors, and improve the operational efficiency of its team. That's a huge win for any company, and Cloudflare is proud to be a part of their cloud migration.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\"Performance and Security are imperative to our company, especially going forward as we look to utilize more public cloud based services. Cloudflare's WAF and built in zone security level has enhanced our security and detected and blocked malicious activity.</b></center> \n <p></p>\n<center><b>I have no doubt in my mind that Cloudflare is the best out there at the moment in what they do.\"\n</b></center>\n<center><i>- Mark Bell</center>\n  <center>Systems Engineer, Auto Trader</i></center>\n</br>\n\n---\n\n*You can learn more about Cloudflare's suite of security and performance products [here](https://cloudflare.com \"Cloudflare Homepage\").*\n",

						"longDescription": "If you're a creative, one of the most challenging parts of your job is getting your work in front of the right audience. [ArtStation's](https://www.artstation.com \"ArtStation's\") platform helps solve that: it enables professional artists and designers to showcase their portfolios, find work and make money via an online marketplace. \n\nIt's a vibrant hub of creativity that's growing quickly — enough so that it caught the attention of one of the Internet's most prevalent threats: bots. Lots of bots.\n\nArtStation's battle with malicious bots climaxed at the company's holiday office party. In the midst of the festivities, the ArtStation team noticed an influx of complaints from customers. Soon, they realized that bots had attempted to hijack thousands of accounts using credentials harvested from security breaches elsewhere — with enough success to deluge the site with spam.\n\nArtStation founder and CEO Leonard Teo says the team quickly worked to clean up the site and repair compromised accounts. Due to the increased sophistication and quantity of the malicious activity, ArtStation turned to Cloudflare.\n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Bots get in the way of building our platform. We've seen everything from competitors scraping our content to bad actors that stuff credentials in order to gain access to customer accounts. The safety of our client accounts are paramount and these bot attacks that were increasing in frequency and sophistication were undermining our business.\"</b></center>\n\n<center><i>- Leonard Teo</center>\n  <center>Founder and CEO, ArtStation</i></center>\n</br>\n\n## An Old Threat Learns New Tricks\nBots are computer programs that automatically navigate and interact with the Internet. Some are benign, like the Googlebot, which crawls the web with the aim of improving Google's search engine. But many bots are malicious — they aspire to exploit stolen passwords, scrape content, and fill sites with spam.\n\nNefarious bots have existed for years, but it's only more recently that they've become an epidemic. What's worse, today's bots have learned to bypass conventional mitigation techniques like rate limiting and IP blocking. In one month, 11 billion login attempts — 50% of all login attempts across Cloudflare's millions of Internet properties — are made by bots instead of by humans. That's why Cloudflare developed a novel, robust solution founded in machine learning.\n\n## The Cloudflare Difference\nCloudflare's [Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/ \"Bot Management\") is powered by the collective intelligence derived from the millions of Internet properties on its network. Whenever Cloudflare detects a bot attack in one part of the network, it informs a threat recognition model that is applied across every other site. In other words: every bot attack makes Cloudflare's defenses even stronger.\n\nThe key is machine learning. Because of the immense scale of Cloudflare's network — Internet requests for millions of websites run through Cloudflare's network — it can apply machine learning algorithms to detect patterns that would otherwise be invisible. Cloudflare's Bot Management also goes one step further: it doesn't just look at the initial fingerprint of a potential threat; it also evaluates its behavior over time.\n\nAnd because some bots are good (indeed, search engine bots are essential to many businesses) Cloudflare Bot Management automates allowlisting traffic from benign actors.\n\n## A Clean Palette \nAs soon as ArtStation turned on Cloudflare Bot Management, its team realized the problem was even bigger than it first thought: \"*Hundreds of thousands* of malicious requests were swarming the site. There were attacks we weren't even aware of,\" Teo says.\n\nEnabling Bot Management swiftly resolved that. Foiled by Cloudflare's robust protection, the bots decided to turn their malicious intent elsewhere. \n\n</br>\n<center><b>\n\"Before enabling Cloudflare's Bot Management, you don't really have much idea about what's going on with your site — all you can see are the results of malicious bot activity.</b></center>\n<p></p>\n<center><b>With Cloudflare, we could see hundreds of thousands of malicious requests rotating through IP addresses, trying to login using hacked credentials and spam our site. Cloudflare automatically blocked them.</b></center> \n<p></p>\n<center><b>Soon, we saw the number of malicious attacks drop drastically. Because of Cloudflare, it just wasn't worth the bother, so they gave up. We still see a few bots trying — but they don't get through, thanks to Cloudflare.\"</b></center>\n\n<center><i>- Leonard Teo</center>\n  <center>Founder and CEO, ArtStation</i></center>\n</br>",

						"longDescription": "## __Video Streaming when Design Matters__\n\nKimberley Seldon, the founder of *Business of Design*, is an interior design professional who is well known in the design world. She has had three of her own TV series and is frequently featured in broadcast television programs and in magazines across the US and Canada. She has also published several *Business of Design* instructional volumes where she shares invaluable lessons from her extensive career in building and growing a design practice.\n\nIn 2006, she launched an online learning platform for professional interior designers, decorators, stylists, and architects under her *Business of Design* brand. \"I created *Business of Design* because I wanted to transform the industry, one designer at a time. It's time to improve efficiencies, profits and client satisfaction\", explains Seldon. \n\nIn addition to providing free podcasts and content on her site to an international community of over 3,000 free and paid members, the site offers a growing catalog of over 350 videos that can help designers increase profitability and grow their practice. These videos can only be accessed with a paid subscription.\n\n__What brought them to Cloudflare__\n\n*Business of Design* started using Cloudflare in early 2018 after they experienced unusually high volumes of unwanted spam traffic that began to hinder the performance of the site. Cloudflare's DDoS protection was an easy win in helping them manage these types of attacks. As a key element of their \"defense in depth\" IT security strategy, Cloudflare allows them to identify suspect traffic that originates from certain regions or countries that have been known perpetrators. With the addition of rate limiting, *Business of Design* is now able to throttle any high volume requests and prevent them from degrading their hosted server infrastructure. \n\n<img src=\"//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7eqabb706rs26AtixXo38Z/6cba94b5568dd896ad38261037de708f/BODstreamplayerSS01.jpg\" class=\"responsive-image responsive-image--800px-width center-image--no-margin\">\n\n*Business of Design* features video extensively — posing a challenge for their original infrastructure, which streamed each video directly from the company's servers. As their video catalog and user base grew, subscribers (especially those overseas) were beginning to experience intermittent issues with video quality. Subscriber support requests began to escalate, and the company needed to explore a better way to support their video distribution needs. \n\nSeldon asked her Internet strategy consultant, Randolph Klein, to help the company resolve the issue. \"It was clear that they needed to deploy some kind of CDN service, and after I researched the new Stream product it made sense, since we were already using Cloudflare's internationally distributed network for DDoS protection\" explained Klein.\n\nBy enabling Stream, *Business of Design* was immediately able to tap into Cloudflare's global infrastructure — with the benefits of an integrated video management system, automatic encoding, and a custom video player. Today, all paid subscriber videos are published with Stream:  \n\n\"Once we moved our video catalog over to Stream, user complaints about video quality pretty much went away\", says Klein. *Business of Design's* content manager, Cheryl Horne, also reports that she finds it easy to upload new videos to Stream and then publish them quickly using the embed link provided by Cloudflare.\n\n\"We're very happy with Cloudflare, it's an incredible service that is not only cost-effective but helps us keep our site online and keep our subscribers happy\" concludes Seldon.\n",

						"longDescription": "If you've ever surfed the web looking for the latest in memes or unusually-talented housepets, there's a good chance you've landed at 9GAG, one of the Internet's most popular sources of short-form entertainment, with oodles of memes, gifs, and other viral content posted every day. As 9GAG cofounder Derek Chan puts it, \"We want to promote the idea of fun.\" And they're doing it at a massive scale.\n\nIn the last five years, 9GAG has skyrocketed in popularity: between its website and mobile apps, 9GAG now draws over 150 million unique visitors per month who consume billions of the site's image assets.\n\n## 9GAG's Challenge\n\nGrowing that big, that quickly, is a recipe for infrastructure hurdles — and 9GAG is no stranger to the associated headaches. 9GAG Chief Technologist and Cofounder Derek Chan says that before switching to Cloudflare, 9GAG used a CDN that couldn't provide the reliability or features it needed to keep up with its growing audience. \n\nMultiple times a week, users would write in to complain about slow loading speeds — pain that was compounded by subsequent support exchanges and fire-drills as 9GAG's engineering staff tried to home in on what was bogging down its network. Even worse: 9GAG was facing attacks from hostile actors, who employed a sophisticated botnet to take the site down for an entire day.\n\nPerformance is crucial for most web properties, but it's especially important for 9GAG. Users are often visiting the site for a quick, bite-sized morsel of content; something that will keep them busy during a fleeting moment of downtime. Sluggish loading screens are the opposite of what they're looking for — and too many slow experiences will lead them to turn elsewhere. For 9GAG, a slow and unreliable site represents an existential threat.\n\nFinally, enough was enough.\n\n9GAG needed a cloud provider that could fend off crippling DDoS attacks — and one that could accelerate performance as much as possible. The team didn't take any chances as it explored switching to another provider: it put together its own testing methodology, directing 5% of traffic to several content-delivery networks. Then they compared each CDN's performance in 9GAG's top geographic regions including Thailand, Philippines, India, and Australia. \n\nThe winner — by a large margin — was Cloudflare.\n\n## The Cloudflare Difference\n\nSince switching to Cloudflare, Chan says that 9GAG's performance issues have become a thing of the past. The improvement is especially noticeable in Southeast Asia, where 9GAG used to suffer from significant lag in regions like the Philippines. Today, thanks to the proximity of Cloudflare's servers in the area — and its overall network spanning %{DataCenterCount} cities across the world — 9GAG's content reaches its visitors much faster and more reliably. Better yet, 9GAG has seen roughly 30% cost savings on its CDN bill since switching to Cloudflare.\n\nAnd since enabling Cloudflare's security protection — with features like [DDoS mitigation](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/ \"DDoS Mitigation\") and [rate limiting](https://www.cloudflare.com/rate-limiting/ \"rate limiting\") — 9GAG hasn't suffered any more downtime from malicious attacks.\n\n![everything just worked](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2xPVuHLfN7Jn3qFjoUXb3M/66c0e819d58ec093ca34890ab06bddab/everything_just_worked.jpg)\n\nCloudflare is built around innovative technology, but there's no substitute for having a team of experts on call. Chan says that on the rare occasion he's had reason to contact Cloudflare support, his experience has set Cloudflare even further apart from the competition.<br>\n\n<center><b>\"Some other companies, they may just have an outsourced worker who is not actually solving the issue. After a few days' wait they ask you to do this or that — and it doesn't fix the problem.</b></center>\n<p></p>\n<center><b>With Cloudflare, the support staff is very responsive and actually helpful. They dive into the issue and get it resolved.\"</b></center>\n<center><i>- 9GAG CTO & Cofounder</center>\n  <center>Derek Chan</i></center>\n\nFrom performance boosts to peace-of-mind, 9GAG continues to expand its use of Cloudflare to include a range of new services. [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-access/ \"Cloudflare Access\") gives employees a secure way to access 9GAG's intranet, and the company is experimenting with the [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/ \"Cloudflare Workers\") platform to deploy custom software on Cloudflare's network edge.\n\nBut the thing that makes Chan happiest? The number of messages he gets from frustrated users. \n\n<center><b>\"When we switched to Cloudflare, those emails stopped. That's the best metric I can think of.\"</b></center>\n<center><i>- 9GAG CTO & Cofounder</center>\n  <center>Derek Chan</i></center>\n",

						"longDescription": "*Black Friday is the biggest day of the year for retailers. But what if your customers <u>are</u> the retailers?*\n\nFrom user acquisition to sales promotions, personalized abandoned shopping cart campaigns and transactional shipping confirmations — the world of ecommerce is driven by 1:1 communications channels operating at tremendous scale. \n\nOne company that powers the customer engagement programs for some of the world's leading brands is [Cordial](https://cordial.com/ \"Cordial\"), a marketing automation platform built from the ground-up to deliver highly personalized messages via any content channel — including email, SMS, in-app notifications, and more. Unlike most marketing tools, Cordial empowers developers to customize the product to suit their needs, while maintaining an intuitive front-end that enables marketers to execute sophisticated, impactful orchestrations without the need for technical resources.\n\n## The Cloudflare Difference\nIn early 2018, Cordial switched to Cloudflare as its network provider. Cordial's Platform Architect Daniel Smith says they saw remarkable improvements right out of the gate, explaining that \"the immediate gain we got without having to do additional development was huge for us.\" \n\nBy moving Cordial onto Cloudflare's network, 80% of requests to Cordial's servers were suddenly routed to Cloudflare, yielding major savings on bandwidth and performance. Better yet, by enabling Cloudflare's Argo Smart Routing, Cordial saw its API server latency drop from an average response time of 650ms before Argo to 403ms the day after they enabled it — an improvement of over 35% on day one.\n\n![cordial image 1 argo enabled uncacheable](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/ge53VjpusYdDgTLUwQaUf/1a82a8da78d17da071e46df091f24581/cordial_image_1_argo_enabled_uncacheable.png)\n<em><center>Uncacheable API Request Latency (lower is better)</center></em>\n\n![cordial image 2 argo static](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/XKXr8YMZFhmCQb8otl6am/9d18aaef70565ed432cec4a7d152b18d/cordial_image_2_argo_static.png)\n<em><center>Static Content Latency (lower is better)</center></em>\n\nThese gains became especially important as the biggest weekend of the year approached, bookended by Black Friday and Cyber Monday. \n\nCordial isn't a retail company, but its customers are — and Black Friday is the year's annual do-or-die event. Online shoppers are impatient, and sluggish performance or a broken link can be enough to send them to a competitor. Cordial needs to be at the top of its game: it has to think like a retailer, anticipating and managing a massive traffic volume in the weeks leading up to Black Friday — and the deluge on the big day itself.\n\nCloudflare's Content Delivery Network and  Argo Smart Routing helped put Cordial on solid footing. But for the main event, Cordial turned to a powerful new tool: [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/).\n\n## Workers at the Ready\n\nAt the heart of Cloudflare Workers is a revolutionary concept: use the servers that make up Cloudflare's global cloud network — namely the machines nearest to each respective visitor — to execute sandboxed code without dedicated virtual machines or containers. By closing the distance between browsers and the machines processing their requests, Cloudflare Workers radically reduce latency, translating to big performance gains at a low cost.\n\nIn the run-up to Black Friday, Cordial built what Platform Architect Daniel Smith dubs a \"stable of Workers\": dozens of mini-apps that the company is ready to deploy at a moment's notice. Each Worker is suited for a specific job, like shedding traffic that is likely junk, or routing certain kinds of requests to a particular server to reduce load during critical moments. The team also drafted a corresponding 'game day' document outlining which contingencies should invoke each Worker.\n\nFinally, as Black Friday weekend swept the Internet, Cordial was ready — and with their stable of Workers in-hand, it sent millions of emails, text messages, and other correspondence without a hitch.\n\n## Looking Ahead\nCordial has also found additional innovative ways to put Cloudflare Workers to use. When one of its customers requested a feature — a way to generate and embed custom barcodes in customers' emails — Cordial used Workers to develop a bespoke app. Using Rust, compiled to web assembly, Cordial's Workers app generates and delivers a barcode image on-the-fly in Workers without needing to spin up any additional servers (try [this link](https://barcodes.cfw.cordial.com/gen/?p=eyJzeW1ib2xvZ3kiOiJjb2RlMTI4IiwidGV4dCI6ImNvcmRpYWxvbmNsb3VkZmxhcmUiLCJwYWRkaW5nIjoxMCwic2NhbGUiOjJ9&s=znuvfM71Zm63cq6XndU9DyAAcx6KX0UuMAE7aAu3kGA \"Cordial Workers App\") to see it in action). Better yet, Smith says that since deploying the app, the team rarely has to think about it. \n\n> \"If it weren't for Cloudflare Workers, we'd be managing another cluster of servers to run this microservice, which means additional maintenance costs and overhead. With Workers, we don't have to worry about it.\"  — Daniel Smith, Cordial Platform Architect\n\n![cordialoncloudflare](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/Elsu8wkWLehlSmUJWe8Py/0736ad9def9a1f6f69e3f2788427f56a/cordialoncloudflare.png)\n     <center><em>A Barcode Generated On-the-Fly by Cordial's Workers App</em></center>",

We're building one of the world's largest global cloud networks to help make the Internet faster, more secure, and more reliable.*\n\n*Meet our customer FindLaw. FindLaw is a Thomson Reuters company. They're a digital marketing agency for law firms. Their primary goal is to provide cost-effective marketing solutions for their customers.*\n\nTheresa: My name's Theresa Jurisch. I'm a lead security engineer at Thomson Reuters.\n\nJesse: Hello, my name is Jesse Haraldson, I'm a senior software architect for FindLaw, a Thomson Reuters business.\n\nTheresa: So, as the lead security engineer I get to do anything and everything related to security, which is interesting.\n\n*FindLaw's primary challenge was to be able to maintain the scale and volume needed to onboard thousands of customers and their individual websites.*\n\nJesse: So the major challenge that led us to using Cloudflare, is Google was making some noises around emphasizing SSL sites. They were gonna modify the Chrome browser to mark sites that weren't SSL as non-secure. We wanted to find a way to at-scale move 8500 sites to SSL reasonably quickly.\n\nTheresa: And doing that to scale, up to speed with our operations it needed to be something that was seamless, it needed to be something that just happened. We had tried a few different things previously and it was not going well and we tried out Cloudflare and it worked, just kind of out of the gate. \n\n*Like us, FindLaw cares about making security and performance a priority, not only for their customers, but for their customers' customers.*\n\nTheresa: Faster web performance means having customers who actually continue to sites, it means having customers who maintain and go with the sites\n\nJesse: 65% of our customers are seeing faster network performance due to Argo, so that's an extremely important thing. \n\nTheresa: The performance, the accuracy, the speed of that site — fronted by Cloudflare — is super essential in getting that connection made.\n\nJesse: I like the continued innovation and push that Cloudflare brings.\n\nTheresa: Cloudflare is amazing. Cloudflare is such a relief. \n\n*With customers like Thomson Reuters FindLaw and millions of other Internet properties that trust Cloudflare with their security and performance, we're making the Internet fast, secure, and more reliable for everyone.* \n\n*Cloudflare: Helping build a better Internet.*\n",

						"longDescription": "*Nodecraft's cofounder calls decision a \"Total No-Brainer\"*\n\nIn the old days, if you wanted to play a game online you were subject to the whims of whomever ran the server — whether it was the choice of levels you played, game duration, or even the rules. Today, thanks to [Nodecraft](https://nodecraft.com/ \"Nodecraft\"), anyone can play on their home turf without needing an IT department to do it.\n\nNodecraft gives users an easy way to set up their own game servers, with support for hits like *Minecraft*, *ARK: Survival Evolved*, and *Counter-Strike*. From parents who want a family-friendly *Minecraft* server for their kids, to gaming 'clans' practicing their tactics together, Nodecraft makes it easy for its users to create the experience they're looking for.\n\nOne of the best things about Nodecraft is its flexibility: you can play *Minecraft* on your server one day, switch that server to run *ARK* the next — then return to the original game, with all of its settings and data intact. It's a delightful experience for gamers, but behind the scenes it involves considerable storage space, and, crucially, a lot of bandwidth.\n\nUntil recently, Nodecraft stored customers' server instances on Amazon AWS's S3.As Nodecraft's popularity increased, however, its server bills were growing at an uncomfortable rate. AWS was charging Nodecraft not just for the storage space it was using, but also for so-called 'egress' fees, charging Nodecraft for transferring that stored data to customers.\n\nAs Nodecraft co-founder and CTO James Ross puts it, \"Not only were we paying high egress fees, but S3's pricing model lacked transparency.  It was a nightmare trying to manage the at times 30 or more different variables impacting our bill.\"  \n\n## Enter the Bandwidth Alliance.\n\n![bandwidthalliance logo](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4PLgaJTiWkWK8IkEyQikk2/29d96e83c1a4dfb2d931a2c7cf5c379a/bandwidthalliance_logo.png)\n\n[Launched](https://blog.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/ \"Bandwidth Alliance Launch\") in Fall 2018, the [Bandwidth Alliance](https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/ \"Bandwidth Alliance\") is an initiative started by Cloudflare in tandem with over a dozen leading cloud providers to make the Internet fairer and data more portable. In short, partners in the Bandwidth Alliance have agreed to waive egress fees for transfers between other partner networks — either in their entirety or at a steep discount.\n\nNodecraft chose to shift its storage to Bandwidth Alliance member [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/).  As a result, Nodecraft completely eliminated the egress fees it was paying — representing huge savings in the long run - and additionally benefited from the lower costs of Backblaze's innovative, pay-as-you-go B2 cloud storage service compared with AWS's competing service.\n\n\"We saved 85% on our monthly data storage expenses thanks to the Bandwidth Alliance,\" said Ross, \"with significant savings on storage fees on top of no longer paying egress charges.\"\n\nHow does that work? Nodecraft stores its data on Backblaze's B2 Storage and delivers that content to customers via Cloudflare's network, which has over 200 points of presence around the world. Because Backblaze and Cloudflare are both members of the Bandwidth Alliance, there is no charge to transfer data between them. And those savings are passed on to Nodecraft.\n\nNodecraft reinvested these savings into further growing its business.  \"We hired an additional developer, and can now afford to retain customers' game data for longer periods, which has increased our customer satisfaction.\"\n\n\"The cost savings of the Bandwidth Alliance can be huge,\" according to Ross.  Especially if your cloud storage is with a provider who is charging you more than you may realize for your egress.  We now have the peace of mind of not having to worry about high and unpredictable fees.\"\n\nAlong with the benefits of the Bandwidth Alliance, Nodecraft is leveraging Cloudflare's network in many other ways: Ross says that the company uses it \"for pretty much everything\", from [DDoS protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos \"DDoS Protection\") to the performance boosts of [Argo Smart Routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing \"Argo Smart Routing\").\n\n*To learn more about the Bandwidth Alliance and how you can start saving - visit our [overview here](https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/ \"Bandwidth Alliance\").* \n",

						"longDescription": "## __MEW (MyEtherWallet) Works With Cloudflare to Keep Users Safe__\n\nOver the last few years, MEW (MyEtherWallet) has established itself as one of the best-known firms in the world of cryptocurrency. But unlike most other marquee names in this space, MEW doesn't run a currency exchange or sell crypto assets. Instead, it provides a free and open-source software tool that lets users conduct their own blockchain transactions — along with educational content about the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nIn principle this means MEW has relatively few attack vectors: it doesn't store users' passwords or private encryption keys, nor does it have access to their digital funds — and its software runs locally on each user's computer. But with so much money at stake, it's no surprise that hackers took aim at the site. And they got creative.\n\nIn early 2018, cybercriminals deployed a sophisticated attack on MEW that exploited a fundamental weakness in the way the Internet routes traffic. In short, hackers managed to convince one of Amazon's authoritative servers — one of the main Internet servers that directs network traffic — that all queries for the website MyEtherWallet.com should be directed to a new destination. \n\nThe imposter website looked identical to MyEtherWallet.com and offered the same functionality, with one vital difference: it sent users' private keys to the hackers, effectively handing over their cryptocurrency. MyEtherWallet.com wasn't hacked, but users were being sent to a site that was.\n\nAs we explained in Cloudflare's [detailed analysis of the attack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/ \"BGP Leaks and Crypto Currencies\"), this wasn't MEW's fault (nor was it uniquely Amazon's). Instead, MEW was a victim of the status quo: from the ISPs that were fooled into syndicating a fraudulent web address to the lack of protection on the DNS resolvers — these aging parts of the Internet have left themselves exposed. And the truth is, the vast majority of websites are vulnerable to the same sort of attack.\n\nBut that was little consolation to MEW as it watched its good name get dragged through the mud. To make sure it never happened again, MEW partnered with Cloudflare.\n\n![dnssec logo resized](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/718dmgLeh26iaO02wq80K4/c274de17782cae4acd35f96051e479ca/dnssec_logo_resized.png)\n\n## The Cloudflare Difference\n\nCloudflare's mission is to help build a better Internet — and a big part of that is proactively fixing vulnerabilities in the Internet's core infrastructure. For years, Cloudflare has been working on preventing the very kind of attack that targeted MEW, known as a BGP leak, by employing a technology called DNSSEC.\n\nIf DNS is the Internet's [phone book](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/ \"What is DNS\"), DNSSEC is the fact-checker that makes sure each number belongs to the contact listed. It was conceived in the 1990s, when these security holes were first identified, but has struggled to get significant adoption because of the complexity involved. That's hardly a good excuse — especially decades later — which is why Cloudflare has endeavored on a mission to raise the bar for everyone. \n\nAs *TechCrunch* recently [wrote](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/cloudflare-dnssec-one-click-securing-internet/ \"Cloudflare's new one-click DNSSEC - TechCrunch\"): \n\n> \"...DNSSEC adoption is woefully low. Just three percent of websites in the Fortune 1000 sign their primary domains...  Cloudflare now wants to do the hard work in setting those crucial DS records, a necessary component in setting up DNSSEC, for customers on a supported registrar.\"\n\nFor MEW, the choice to move to Cloudflare was an obvious one. With industry-leading DNSSEC support — and a host of accompanying security and performance enhancements — Cloudflare gave MEW the protection it needs, sans the headaches it would've gotten elsewhere.\n\n> \"Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated and we needed a way to defend against attacks like these. Moving to Cloudflare was the best and most straightforward way to do it.\" - Kosala Hemachandra, MEW Founder and CEO\n\nWhile there's still work to be done in getting more Internet stakeholders to implement DNSSEC, it's never been easier for Cloudflare customers to get on board. Today, anyone who uses Cloudflare as their DNS, in tandem with a supported registrar, can enable DNSSEC in [just one click](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/cloudflare-dnssec-one-click-securing-internet/ \"Just One Click\"). \n\nBetter yet: now that Cloudflare is the world's [first Registrar you can love](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/ \"Cloudflare Registrar\") — with zero-markup pricing and no surprise renewal fees — you can register, configure, and secure your domains with DNSSEC, all from one easy-to-use dashboard. \n\n*Curious about the blockchain?

But spam doesn't just lead to bloated inboxes: it can keep customers from seeing emails they actually want to see. Over the years, the Internet has evolved defenses against spam, like reputation systems used by top email senders (the Mailchimps of the world) to block and filter out the noise. The problem is that these systems aren't perfect — and sometimes legitimate email gets lumped in with the cruft.\n\nTo avoid this fate, it's increasingly important for businesses to validate the integrity of their customers' email addresses. [ZeroBounce](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/zerobounce-subscriptions) automatically scans your mailing lists and filters out invalid addresses — including the 'spam traps' that inform the web's reputation trackers. This translates to improvements in your email deliverability, ensuring your email marketing is a reliable connection between you and your customers. \n\nThere's no better way to ensure a high-quality mailing list than by being proactive about it. That's why ZeroBounce built its subscription plugin: a subscription form that validates email addresses in real-time as they're being submitted (it'll even warn users if it notices they've made a common typo). With key features like 98+% verification accuracy, drag-and-drop customization, and GDPR compliance — this little widget packs a punch. \n\nAnd thanks to Cloudflare Apps Marketplace, it's never been easier to use it.\n\n\n## The Cloudflare Apps Marketplace\n\nTo install the ZeroBounce subscription form on their websites, Cloudflare users need only visit its listing on [Cloudflare Apps Marketplace](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/zerobounce-subscriptions) — they can even preview what the form looks like on their site in a single click.\n\nZeroBounce CEO Liviu Tanase says that Cloudflare Marketplace gives the company a unique avenue to reach new customers, some of whom may lack the technical proficiency to implement it otherwise. Even for expert coders, it's easily the most efficient way to add this kind of functionality to a website. \n\nThis underscores what makes Cloudflare Marketplace so powerful. In most scenarios, installing a dynamic subscription form like ZeroBounce would require modifications to your website's code. Even comparable 'Apps' solutions, like WordPress Plugins and Salesforce AppExchange, are dependent on the platform you're using: if you didn't build your site on one of them, you're out of luck.\n\nBut on Cloudflare Marketplace, you can install any app on your website, no matter what platform you're running on. That's because Cloudflare operates on a deeper level of the internet that's platform-agnostic — and blazing fast. \n\n*Eager to see what ZeroBounce can do for your site? Head to the [Cloudflare Marketplace](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/zerobounce-subscriptions) to find it and dozens of other apps.*\n\n![zerobounceshot](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/RAoLEFewWkWos0gYqEIgi/99f7886cb6ec8eef8c7072d8bc0d7343/zerobounceshot.png)\n",

						"longDescription": "## __Zenprint: Bringing custom printing to Asia Pacific, for everyone__\n\nWhen it comes to getting the word out about your business, there's nothing quite like putting your brand in the real world — in the form of promotional material like banners, books, mugs, and flash drives. But for many businesses that kind of promotion used to amount to high costs and logistical headaches, with minimal insight into the quality of the finished product ahead of time. Thanks to companies like [Zenprint](https://www.zenprint.com.au/), that's changing.\n\nZenprint is a part of Gogoprint, a regional group connecting a large marketplace of consumers and high-quality print suppliers together, allowing small and medium-sized businesses to tap into the printing capacity in their region that they'd otherwise struggle to find. The key is efficiency: Zenprint is able to save on costs and time by leveraging advances in technology — along with its own proprietary algorithms — to match customers with suppliers based on the quality and expertise they're looking for, with optimal turnaround times, quick delivery, and low prices.\n\nIt's a powerful combination of transparency, convenience, and speed that's proved potent: since launching in 2015, Gogoprint has grown to over 130 employees and has expanded into markets including Thailand, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia — with plans to expand to New Zealand, Korea and more.\n\n__The Cloudflare Difference__\n\nAs a company relentlessly focused on efficiency, Zenprint knows it's vital for its website to perform as fast as its customers can create: nobody is going to buy into Zenprint's mission if they find themselves staring at a lagging browser window.\n\nThat's where Cloudflare comes in. Powered by one of the world's most comprehensive network infrastructures, [Cloudflare's CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cdn/) service brings Zenprint's content closer to its customers — leading to striking increases in performance. Since moving its website to Cloudflare in May 2018, Zenprint has seen its website load times improving by up to 300%.\n\nThat's the kind of upgrade that customers notice, and for an eCommerce business like Zenprint, it has a real impact on the company's bottom line. With more than 1,000 possible product permutations available on Zenprint's platform, customers need to be able to quickly switch between configurations — and Cloudflare's global caching support ensures that they never have to wait for a slow website. Zenprint's improved web performance affirms its brand promise of efficiency and leads to lower bounce rates, which translates to increased revenue.\n\nThe bottom-line benefits don't end there. Since implementing Cloudflare, Zenprint has saved an average 20GB of bandwidth costs *per day*. \n\nAnd while there's plenty keeping the Zenprint team busy, Cloudflare is happy to give them a little peace of mind: as it grows, Zenprint stands to become a bigger target for hostile actors. But thanks to Cloudflare's security protections like [DDoS mitigation](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/), their servers are secure and protected.\n",

						"longDescription": "John R. Ashcroft, Missouri Secretary of State (SOS), is the chief elections official in Missouri and is responsible for administering elections in the state. The Office of the SOS manages the Missouri Centralized Voter Registration System (MCVR) which is used by all 116 Local Election Authorities (LEA) and is at the forefront of safeguarding the integrity of Missouri elections. The SOS plays a crucial role in providing support to the LEAs, if requested, with an election security best practices guide, security assessments, and continuity of operation plan creation. In 2020, before the November 3rd general election, the SOS accepted more than 318,000 online voter registration submissions. These submissions include new registrations, address changes, and name changes which are processed by LEA offices. \n\nStacy Mahaney, Chief Information Officer, and Willis Doss, Deputy Chief Information Officer, are responsible for the security and defense of the many SOS websites/applications and MCVR. In the days leading up to election night, the Missouri SOS was responsible for monitoring and assessing potential threats. This responsibility includes sharing and coordinating responses to threat information with federal, state, and local officials in Missouri. \n\nThe Missouri SOS joined the Athenian Project in 2018, onboarding only an archive site of past election results initially. After seeing the benefits of this collaboration along with reviewing guidance provided by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Mahaney and Doss onboarded additional sites. Familiarity with Cloudflare's Enterprise services and excellent support made this change leading up to the 2020 U.S. elections a reality. \n\n\"The idea of our election websites being inaccessible due to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack was a concern for us, especially in the election space where trust and access to authoritative voting information is crucial,\" said Mahaney. \"There is only so much you can plan and test in terms of preparedness on the security side and after implementing Cloudflare and many other security precautions, we felt confident we had a security platform in place where we could adjust and respond to threats and high demand in real-time.\" \n\n### __Preparing for the Unexpected:__\nFor the 2020 U.S. elections, the Missouri Secretary of State's cyber security team worked with a variety of federal government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) along with the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC). The SOS cyber security team has many state partners including the Office of Administration's Information Technology Services Division and the Department of Public Safety which includes the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), and the St. Louis and Kansas City Fusion Centers to aid in securing and ensuring that the election related sites remain accessible. The public looks to election officials as the trusted source for information and finalizing election results. With this in mind, Mahaney and Doss were better prepared for the unexpected. \"Our team and cybersecurity capabilities grow during each election, so we have to train the staff on the new technology our agency uses to secure our processes as we expand,\" said Mahaney. \"Cloudflare solutions are user-friendly and easy to deploy, which allowed us to onboard domains quickly and train our staff on the ins and outs of the Cloudflare security suite.\" \n\nPrior to Cloudflare, Mahaney and Doss in the case of an emergency often had limited or delayed access to their security tools and consoles. During election week, many government agencies provided state and local government's threat briefings and intelligence related to threats and ways to mitigate in real-time on election night. \"In the past, we worked with a variety of vendors and, at times, did not have direct access to our security tools to make immediate changes,\" said Doss. \"To put everything under one umbrella, we had the ability to monitor and quickly change or address pertinent issues during this election cycle.\"\n\nThe Web Application Firewall (WAF) analytics gave the Missouri SOS team visibility into security threats and granular control to quickly deploy custom WAF rules to mitigate new threats aimed at their election resources. Mahaney says, \"The ease of use with Cloudflare, especially the ability to deploy a web application firewall rule in 30 seconds allowed us to adapt and quickly respond.\" In addition to the Cloudflare WAF, the Missouri SOS cached their website heavily on Cloudflare's network, which reduced the bandwidth usage and load on their servers substantially. During the weeks before the election, Mahaney detailed the spikes in traffic primarily accessing the voter registration lookup and voter outreach portal, which provide polling places and sample ballots for review. \"We saw four times the amount of network traffic to the Missouri SOS site on election night,\" said Mahaney. \n\nWhen looking at security for state and local governments, Mahaney and Doss note that LEA offices that provide voting information might not always have the resources or expertise to know how to block threats in real-time or expand network or server capacity in the event of high volumes of unexpected network traffic. The addition of tools such as Cloudflare and the Athenian Project could be a quick way for them to add this level of defense. \"Security is like an onion. Every layer of security that you add protects against various layers of attack or exposure,\" said Mahaney. \"We were able to add layers to our security defenses with Cloudflare. The more layers you add, the more difficult it is for attackers to succeed in making voters question the trust of the democratic process that we work to protect every day.\" \n",

						"shortDescription": "AO is the largest online-only white goods and electricals retailer in the UK. Their company mission is rooted in always finding a better way of doing things to keep their customers happy. ",
						"longDescription": "__Who is AO.com__\nAO is the largest online-only electricals retailer in the UK. Their company's purpose is to relentlessly strive for better ways to ensure their customers are happy. AO started in 2000 with a bet between their founder John Roberts and his friend, JR was insistent that there was a better way for people to buy white goods online that was rooted in the best possible outcome for the consumer. The result of this wager has evolved to the present day as AO, which supports over 3,000 employees in three countries, selling a wide range of electrical items and boasting the world's best recycling plant in Europe. \n\n__Expanding to new markets brings challenges__\nIn 2015, AO began their expansion into Germany and the Netherlands. While the logistical effort of delivering products in these new markets was a challenge, they also faced increased pressure to ensure that their website would perform optimally for customers in these regions. AO implemented a well known content delivery network (CDN) to [improve site performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) across all of their web domains, and to reduce their overall infrastructure costs.\n\nWhile the onboarding process and support was straightforward, it wasn't until they began routing more traffic to the provider's edge network that they started experiencing some new unforeseen challenges.\n\n\"We were new to CDNs, and were unsure about how much traffic was being offloaded to the provider's infrastructure. We were hit with some very high unexpected charges as a result, and this made us question the overall investment return of this solution\" explained Austin Davies, Site Reliability Engineer at AO. They also experienced an outage around this time, and had issues getting their case sufficiently escalated. These events forced AO to begin exploring alternatives for a solution that would be more cost-effective and support over the long term.\n\n__When Cloudflare offers a better way__\nAO considered many other offerings before deciding on Cloudflare. Cloudflare offered a technically innovative platform that included security features like DDoS protection by default, and was less expensive, with no overage charges for seasonal spikes in bandwidth. \n\n__How AO uses Cloudflare__\nAO primarily uses Cloudflare to improve the performance of their web and mobile properties. Faster websites translate to happier customers, and this is core to their mission. Cloudflare exceeded their performance expectations compared to their previous provider \"In almost all circumstances of our performance testing and monitoring, Cloudflare was much faster. I don't think I can find a single measurement that we track where that wasn't the case\" said Davies. \"Once we enabled Cloudflare with features such as Rocket Loader, we immediately saw a 1.7 second decrease in page load times across all of our sites.\" AO uses New Relic to track their apdex scoring, and immediately saw a 10% increase in the number of satisfied requests.\n\nArgo Smart Routing with Tiered Caching was also deployed, which allows Cloudflare to route traffic and requests across the fastest, and least congested network paths to their users. Tiered caching reduces the number of requests that hit their origins by leveraging Cloudflare's Tier-1 data centers to serve requested content. \"Our previous provider seems obsolete compared to Cloudflare. Deploying comparable features like Argo Smart Routing and tiered caching was significantly easier to enable, requiring zero changes to our infrastructure\" Davies explained.\n\nAO also discovered that Cloudflare Workers could help ease the pain of migrating from their previous solution. \"If we didn't use Cloudflare Workers, it would have been very difficult to leave our previous provider. We were using their object storage solution, and many of the image files we tried moving over to AWS S3 included specific encoded symbols which failed in S3.\" Workers runs simple business logic that automatically converts these files so they can be stored in S3. If Workers weren't employed, it would have meant significant code changes to their websites to handle these files in the required S3 format.\n\nCloudflare was able to help AO reduce their costs significantly, even beyond the contracted services. AO deployed many of the web optimization technologies that Cloudflare offers such as Auto Minify and lossless compression, which reduced their page sizes by 50%.\n\nLastly, to ensure a highly resilient architecture across their sites they use Cloudflare load balancing in addition to AWS ALB. ALB supports their EC2 instances, while Cloudflare load balancing provides instant failover from AWS to their co-located provider in the event of an AWS outage.\n\n__Conclusion__\nAO has been very pleased with the change to Cloudflare. The support teams have been very responsive, and have seen measurable improvements in speed and performance of all of their sites on Cloudflare. \"We looked at many other solutions, but at the end of the day, Cloudflare was the only solution that met our technical requirements and delivered the best price performance value\" explained Davies.\n",

						"longDescription": "HubSpot is the industry leader in SaaS products for inbound sales and marketing, helping businesses optimize customer acquisition and engagement. HubSpot's story began in 2004, when its founders Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah met as graduate students at MIT. After working with many startups to develop a go to market strategy, and understanding how ineffective the traditional channels had become, they set out to build a software platform which would support a new approach to marketing.  HubSpot now supports over 40,000 customers in 90+ countries. \n\n__The challenge of delivering SSL__\n\nIn the years that followed, the industry push towards \"HTTPS everywhere\" led HubSpot to explore how it could provide its customer sites with easy to deploy, built in SSL encryption to provide the security that visitors and search engines are looking for. \n\nIn 2015, HubSpot rolled out a solution using a \"shared\" subject alternative name (SAN) SSL certificate with the need for HubSpot engineers to manually \"bundle\" together host names on each SAN certificate.\n\nIt became apparent in the following months that while a good first step, this solution was difficult to scale effectively. It often took as long as five days, from the time a customer requested SSL to the time it could be deployed for them. In 2017, HubSpot began exploring alternative market offerings that could help. \"We were looking for a technology innovator and knew that Cloudflare had been leading the way when it came to SSL technology\" said Kerry Munz, Director of Engineering – Platform Infrastructure at HubSpot.\n\n__Why Cloudflare was the right partner__\n\nCloudflare had widespread industry recognition as a security vendor that provided an easy to deploy managed service. Cloudflare however, at the time did not provide an off the shelf offering for this type of SSL provisioning for third party sites hosted on their platform. When HubSpot began discussions with Cloudflare, HubSpot needed to ensure that not only could Cloudflare develop a solution to support this need, but that Cloudflare's network could also boost the performance of the service via Cloudflare's Content Distribution Network (CDN).\n\nThe challenge was clear, could Cloudflare simplify the process to deliver SSL for HubSpot's customer sites and improve performance? The urgency increased as Google's announcement to flag sites on Chrome that were not encrypted meant many of HubSpot's customers sites would be vulnerable. When HubSpot approached Cloudflare, the urgency had increased with the need to provide SSL for over 40,000 domains before the new Chrome update went into effect. Cloudflare partnered with HubSpot to develop an \"SSL for SaaS\" solution that ultimately helped HubSpot to deploy SSL for 47,000 sites that previously didn't have encryption over the course of five days. This SSL provisioning was designed by HubSpot's engineers using Cloudflare API technology and was done automatically, without any action required by HubSpot's customers. Cloudflare's ability to provision an SSL certificate and propagate it at  Cloudflare's edge in 90 seconds meant this could be incorporated at the customer sign up stage, reducing HubSpot support calls from its customers.\n\n\"Cloudflare became a trusted partner for us in devising this solution\" explained Munz. \"They have a team of incredibly smart engineers that know how to tackle difficult problems, and are always very responsive when issues arise.\" \n\n__Integrated performance and security is a default__\n\nWhile the Cloudflare SSL offering was the key driver for HubSpot, Cloudflare was able to provide key services for accelerated web performance, DDoS protection, data loss prevention, and bot mitigation.  \"Our customers rely on an always available service from HubSpot that is free from bots and malware.  Cloudflare's security services enable our service to be always available and free from attack.\"\n\n\"Our customers rely on us to provide a responsive, easy to use portal to enable HubSpot's marketing solutions for our customers' challenges.  If the portal and accompanying APIs are slow to respond, our customers cannot get their work done and become dissatisfied.\" \n\nCloudflare's Argo Smart Routing was added to improve response times for HubSpot customer sites across Cloudflare's global network, beyond what could be delivered with basic CDN caching. \"When we added Argo, we observed a 35% performance improvement\" said Munz.  \"We've been very pleased with the partnership we've built with Cloudflare\" said Munz. \"As HubSpot grows and evolves, we plan on expanding our use of Cloudflare to other areas at HubSpot. We are very happy with them as a trusted partner.\"",

						"longDescription": "[YPO](https://www.ypo.co.uk/) is a publicly owned UK-based entity that supplies products and services to an array of non-profit and public sector organizations such as schools, local authorities, charities and emergency services in the UK. They leverage the purchasing power of buying en masse to negotiate the best prices on behalf of their customers without compromising on quality.\n\n__Challenges: Safeguarding customer trust, and ensuring website uptime and availability__\n\nOver the past few years, YPO has evolved their [e-commerce website](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) from a rudimentary \"bolted-on\" CMS driven add-on to a fully integrated web platform that enables their customers to fulfil orders seamlessly through procurement. In 2014 they made the decision to move their digital infrastructure to a more robust and scalable cloud-based solution.\n\nOnce they completed this move, they started noticing anomalous traffic hitting their site, particularly IP addresses from foreign domains they don't serve. YPO's core focus is customer satisfaction, \"We benchmark very highly with the Institute of Customer Service (ICS), and that's why the availability and performance of our website matters so much to us\" said Gavin Rimmington, Head of Business Change and IT. \"Our customers need us to be there, and they need to trust that our website is secure, and always available, especially during peak and seasonal demand\" he added.\n\nEven though they never suffered a widespread DDoS attack or ransomware, YPO made the conscious decision to proactively implement security measures that would enable better protection of their digital infrastructure. Their process began with the search for a web application firewall (WAF) solution. \"Our digital provider offered several third-party solutions, but they were overly complex, and required extensive configurations to deploy\" said David O'Brien, Digital & E-Commerce Manager.\n\nO'Brien also explained \"While we were confident that our cloud provider had ample capacity to support increased traffic, we weren't as confident in their capacity to protect our site from the vast number of unknowns and threats out there.\"\n\n__Solution: An easy to deploy, integrated security solution__\n\nYPO explored various WAF solutions, but thought Cloudflare offered the best solution based on ease of onboarding, and the sheer scale and defense intelligence against new threats and attacks.\n\n\"The onboarding experience with Cloudflare was excellent and surprisingly easy. Compared to some of the other offerings we were considering, Cloudflare was the easiest to deploy and we were very pleased with our choice\" he added.\n\nOnce YPO was able to deploy the WAF from Cloudflare, they were able to explore a range of other features and products that could help them improve user experience. \"Cloudflare offers an array of web optimization technologies that we would have never thought of sourcing as a standalone solution from disparate vendors.\" said O'Brien. \"Once we enabled features such as Brotli compression, Auto Minify, Polish and Mirage on Cloudflare for instance, we saw a dramatic improvement in our site performance. We are caching 80% of our traffic on Cloudflare, and saw page load times for both desktop and mobile clients decrease on average by 50% - which was amazing!\"\n\nYPO deploys multiple analytics tools such as pingdom to help them gauge [site performance and improvements](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) with Cloudflare. \"Since deploying Cloudflare, the scoring for our site on yslow.org increased from around the low 70's to mid 90's out of 100\" said O'Brien.\n\nWhile the initial driver for deploying Cloudflare was for a Web Application Firewall, the value quickly expanded to better performance. This allowed YPO to not only ensure uptime for their services, but to also provide a better user experience for their customers and to ensure high customer satisfaction.\n\n__What's next for YPO?__\n\n\"Cloudflare has revolutionized our cyber security, and gives us peace of mind in safeguarding our site and customer trust\" explained Rimmington. \"We are beginning to deploy more performance enhancing features that we get as part of our enterprise contract, such as load balancing.\" Cloudflare's continued innovation, and expansion of its portfolio of services is a key factor for YPO. \"These types of features are extremely beneficial, and Cloudflare's innovation has helped inform our own roadmap, and ultimately future proof our infrastructure.\"\n\n---\n\n1 We use pingdom for monitoring site speed, uptime and a few other items. (based on http://yslow.org/) went from around 70-71/100 to a score that rates our site now between 93 & 95 out of 100.\n\n2 Mobile times via Google, times went from 7 seconds to 4.9 seconds (based on a 3G connection).\n",

Our business is about making our customers' lives easier, so we can't have them dealing with the headache of a breached account.\"\n\nOutside of security, Upside was also looking to optimize their application's performance. \"Speed is a huge priority for us,\" commented Oar, \"we recently executed a site overhaul to make it faster, and we are always looking for areas to continue to optimize the speed of our site, as this helps us get and retain customers.\"\n\n__Upside's Solution: Powerful Rate Limiting and Simplified Deployment__\n\nUpside's existing user-facing tools gave them the basic security and performance they needed, but it had its limitations. \"With our previous solutions, domain names were tightly coupled with the CDN distribution they are running through,\" explained Gorrell. \"With a microservices environment like ours, DNS and deployments need to be easily shuffled around without customer disruption. It's a frustrating and tedious process to accomplish that with the tight coupling.\" While looking for a new vendor, Upside found most solutions for this issue to be overly complicated or too intrusive. The team decided on Cloudflare because it offered ease-of-use, scalability, flexible DNS management, granular Rate Limiting controls, security through the Web Application Firewall (WAF), and CDN.\n\n\"Cloudflare had a lot of features out-of-the-box that solved a number of problems for us,\" Gorrell began. \"Rate Limiting and reputation-based IP scoring help us block the threats we were seeing. By switching to Cloudflare's CDN, we were able simplify our deployment patterns because the CDN is always available, rather than being a coupled unit of deployment attached to a DNS name.\"\n\nWith Cloudflare, Upside has seen a significant drop in attacks, and is able to block the attempts that continue to occur. By leveraging Cloudflare's performance network, Upside has also improved the load times of its pages.",

I want the company to offer its services to as many people in as many locales as possible.\"\n\n__Challenges Ultius Faces: DDoS Attack Mitigation and Application Security & Performance__\n\"We initially came to Cloudflare because we suffered from DDoS threats and wanted global, stable infrastructure that would be rock-solid as we scaled to new regions,\" Dedovic explained. DDoS attacks aimed at Ultius could make their site slow, unresponsive, or entirely unavailable for their users, resulting in a poor user experience, loss of brand credibility, and ultimately lost revenue.\n\nFurthermore, these attacks often serve as distractions during attempts at data theft, so Ulitius was in search of a vendor to further bolster the security of their application and internal facing resources—as with any web marketplace, a compromise of any user data would be a headache for the company and compromise platform trust.\n\nIn addition to protecting and securing the application, Ultius was looking to ensure it could scale quickly and globally, while maintaining a universal experience for its users. This meant finding a bullet-proof managed DNS provider as well as a CDN to quickly deliver content to users regardless of end location.\n\n__Ultius' Solution: A High-Performing, Featured Network Built for Security & Stability__\n\"I looked at other solutions before Cloudflare,\" Dedovic noted, \"but found it to be the most robust, easy-to-use offering. While our existing infrastructure capped our DDoS protection at 5GB/s, Cloudflare offers Unmetered DDoS mitigation that would protect us regardless of attack size.\"\n\n\"When we suffered downtime we immediately calculated a cost-per-hour of that downtime, and then we calculated how often that would happen in a given year. Without getting into specific numbers, the Cloudflare decision certainly had a good return on investment comparing the cost of the service to the cost of our service being offline. Cloudflare's rate limiting and WAF have helped us block 20 times more threats aimed at our infrastructure than our previous solution. With these tools, Cloudflare helps us foster our commitment to our customers' trust and safety.\"\n\n![ultius-graphic-b](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/rErqvhQzK0OQ24QKusOWc/2be7516878fc3608ad7bf2f53ccae861/ultius-graphic-b.svg)\n\nWhen Cloudflare released Access, Ultius was eager to try the new tool seeing it as a potential solution to keep their internal resources secure from outside intrusion. \"Cloudflare Access helps us really tighten our web properties by adding a 2nd level of authentication to important data entry-points,\" Dedovic related. \"We use it to secure all entry-points to resources that hold sensitive data,\" related Dedovic. \"It's a powerful and easy-to-use solution for protecting our internal resources. Plus, I was able to set it up in 20 minutes without any technical changes required. My team loves that we did away with the slow, painful VPN we previously used.\"\n\nUltius now also leverages Cloudflare's best-in-class managed DNS, CDN, and Argo Smart Routing services, which combine to decrease Time-to-First-Byte by over 50% and improve the performance of the application as a whole by over 60%. Dedovic concluded, \"A faster website helps us deliver our service better for our clients, prospective clients, writers, and staff. Adding Cloudflare's performance services to our application directly improved our conversion rate and site availability.\"",

With 100 percent Network Uptime and scalable solutions, we serve clients looking for a secure, affordable data center provider that has them covered (from the data on the ground to the data in the cloud).\"\n\n__Colocation America's Challenge: Improving Performance & Bolstering Protection__\n\n\"As a data center service provider,\" Walters related, \"we know the power and importance of speed. To our clients we highlight the benefits of support, speed, and scalability across their entire IT Infrastructure. We understand how crucial the performance of a website is with connecting to potential clients and converting that business. Knowing that downtime and low connection speed leads to lower revenue, we want to ensure that any potential clients can get the information they need without waiting.\"\n\nFor Walters and team, the decision to enlist a CDN provider to improve the global performance of their corporate website was clear: \"the numbers speak for themselves,\" Walters noted, \"a 1-second delay means 11% fewer page views, 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, and a 7% loss in conversions.\"\n\nPerhaps more important than speed, security is a concern for Colocation America. Understanding that websites are among the most vulnerable ways for corporations to get hacked, Colocation America added additional protection to their corporate website. With the combination of network, hardware, and specifically, website monitoring, Colocation America guarantees 100% uptime in all aspects of their business. \"We offer an uptime value proposition for our customers and we recognized that a large attack could compromise our site and violate that agreement,\" explained Walters.\n\n__Colocation America's Challenge: Improving Performance & Bolstering Protection__\n\n\"By using Cloudflare's CDN services, our site speed is definitely faster than our competitors which gives us an edge,\" stated Walters. \"Our average site load time before Cloudflare was ~5 seconds. Our average afterwards is ~2 seconds.\" By the same statistics as earlier, this performance improvement translates to a 21% increase in conversion to Colocation America's site and a 48% increase in customer satisfaction.\n\n\"Beyond support, speed, and scalability clients look to us for security. Although we monitor and secure full I.T. infrastructures for businesses, many businesses fail to secure their site. Many hacks and security issues start from one plugin hole or, even, a unsecured contact form. This is why going with a company that specializes in website security is a must! We know that our site will remain online and profitable thanks to the measures taken by Cloudflare to protect us.\"",

People come to our website for all sorts of things ranging from reporting illegal signs, to contacting the County Executive, to paying water bills. The government is always on in some capacity; we manage 24/7 IT services as well as normal, everyday citizen functions.\"\n\n__The County's Challenge: Malicious Attackers Focused on their Website__\n\n\"We had our website defaced back in June,\" the Deputy CIO related. \"I think we got on the radar of people pointing their scripts at different sites to see if they worked. Then we had a DDoS attack, which took us offline. We tried isolated IP blocking and firewall type solutions, but they were ineffective.\"\n\n__The County's Solution: A Helping Hand__\n\n\"Folks in our office had heard of Cloudflare's Web Security,\" the deputy CIO noted, \"so when the discussion in the office began to be about 'finding a vendor like Cloudflare' they were the first vendor we turned to. We came to Cloudflare and they worked closely with us to get our system behind them without having the money part of things figured out. When you're sitting there and your system is offline from a DDoS attack, no one cares that you have to go through a whole government RFP and buying process, they just want the site online. Cloudflare helped me solve the technical problem, implement a solution on a Friday night before a long weekend, and said we could worry about the money next week. As someone who was at maximum frustration that was music to my ears.\"",

Furthermore, OAC faced the challenge of spikes in traffic that occurred at the beginning of the school year and during assignment deadlines. These traffic spikes have the potential to knock OAC's site offline at a time the students need it most— at the beginning of the year when they're enrolling in new classes and when they're submitting assignments. OAC recognized that they could solve for the traffic spike issue by buying expensive hardware or cloud infrastructure, but this investment would go underutilized and unused while OAC experienced normal traffic.\n\n__Open Access College's Solution: Easy, Integrated Performance and Security__\n\nOAC found Cloudflare to be the perfect solution to their challenge at an affordable price. Cloudflare's Content Delivery Network caches and serves OAC's web content from data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world. This distribution ensures a high performing site for all of OAC's students. Cloudflare's CDN and automated DDoS mitigation also ensure that OAC's site is readily available—because Cloudflare handles more than 45% of OAC's bandwidth, their infrastructure is never overloaded and, in fact, OAC needs 48% fewer servers to run their site.",

The solution comes integrated with 4 core platforms: courses, online testing, virtual classrooms, and a content management system.\n\n__BrainCert's Challenge: Secure, Optimized Content for White-Labled Sites__\n\nAs BrainCert grew, it faced two distinct challenges. The first, was ensuring a high quality, universal web experience for its customers and their users around the world. While BrainCert had multi-origin infrastructure, it couldn't afford to have an origin server in every locale of its users. This caused frustration for BrainCert's customers' users as the further they were away from BrainCert's infrastructure, the slower and less responsive the learning applications were, even if BrainCert's customer was locally based.\n\nBraincert's second challenge was securing the hostnames of their customers. BrainCert's customers can offer courses on their own domains, however, purchasing, managing, and renewing SSL certificates for multiple organizations became a difficult, non-scalable process. As Yasin Rahim, founder and CEO of Braincert, related \"it became hard to find a working solution to offer SSL certificates under our customers hostnames. As our customer base grew in size, managing the SSL certificate lifecycle for each of their sites was tedious, difficult, and prone to error. This wasn't a solution that we could continue to scale with.\"\n\n__BrainCert's Solution: A Large Scale Performance Network with Powerful Security__\n\nBefore Cloudflare, BrainCert tried a number of vendors to meet their challenges, but none met the performance and security needs. \"We've tried competitors to Cloudflare,\" Rahim noted, \"but they were more complex and required engineering time to manually change code. In the end, we selected Cloudflare as it offered more features and everything was easy to manage with few clicks in the dashboard. Now, we don't have to to scratch our heads and worry about code level configurations.\"\n\n## *\"Before Cloudflare, BrainCert tried a number of vendors to meet their challenges, but none met the performance and security needs. . .\"*\n\nRahim continued \"Having our traffic handled by Cloudflare at the edge not only improves our global performance, but because Cloudflare's performance offering is integrated with security it also makes it easy to stop attacks and protect our network.\" With Cloudflare BrainCert has improved the overall load time of their application by over 40% and has seen a 97% reduction in threats to their infrastructure with Cloudflare's WAF.\n\nFurthermore, Cloudflare's SSL for SaaS product was designed to solve the headache SaaS companies experience handling the SSL certificates of their customers. \"Cloudflare's SSL for SaaS product fit our needs nicely and gave us a technological advantage over our competitors,\" Rahim related. \"Now, we generate SSL certificates for our corporate customers and secure their SaaS applications. SSL for SaaS has reduced the engineering workload we face by almost 90% by allowing us to integrate and automate SSL certificates using Cloudflare's API. That gave us the confidence to go-to-market with the bold claim that we can protect our customer's SaaS application and secure their hostnames within 30 seconds. Our customers love this!\"",

As their customer base continues to grow and they continue to reach more remote parts of the world, having a network that extends to these places is critical for offering customers an enjoyable online experience. \"In addition to the fact that latency and purchase conversion are directly related,\" commented Nirbhab Barat AVP of DevOps at Lenskart. \"We were facing a growing number of security threats and DDoS attacks. If we wanted to continue to grow at a rapid rate, while maintaining a healthy business we were going to have to invest in infrastructure either by building it ourselves or turning to a vendor.\"\n\nWanting to keep their engineers working on core-business functions, Lenskart looked at the market for the right solutions for their needs.\n\n__Lenskart's Solution: A Security Focussed Performance Network__\n\n\"Cloudflare was great because it met the performance and content delivery challenges that we were looking to solve, but the breadth of services they offered like their security suite of products simultaneously helped solve other challenges for our business,\" Barat commented.\n\nLenskart uses Cloudflare's CDN to cache and serve their content from data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world thereby saving over 72% or 8 TB of bandwidth every month. In addition, Lenskart makes use of Cloudflare's Railgun technology, which optimizes the connection from Lenskart origin servers to Cloudflare's network edge, further improving the performance of Lenskart's site. Cloudflare's expansive network and performance optimization helps ensure that Lenskart's site is high-functioning for their users regardless of geographic location.\n\nFurthermore, Cloudflare's security products help Lenskart stay online and safe from attack. \"Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall blocks over 30,000 threats from hitting our website every month,\" Barat noted. \"We process sensitive customer data, so having Cloudflare as an extra layer of protection to prevent exfiltration of that data brings us peace-of-mind. Plus, with Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation we know our site won't experience costly down-time.\"",

						"longDescription": "Majal is a non-profit organization dedicated to amplifying underrepresented voices and promoting social justice, particularly in the Middle East. In a region where oppression, censorship, and marginalization are prevalent, Majal's network of websites offer a rare outlet for self-expression to those who need it most.\n\nSince it first launched as Mideast Youth in 2006, Majal's network of communities has grown to include:\n\nMigrant-Rights.org - dedicated to documenting the plight of migrant workers across the region, and humanizing their experiences. The site also provides resources to migrants in the hopes of helping them improve or escape their situation.\nMideast Tunes - showcases independent and underground musicians using their art as a tool for social justice advocacy. The platform has helped launch the careers of underground, mold-breaking artists in the region and beyond.\nCrowdVoice.org - Monitors, consolidates, and contextualizes crowdsourced content comprising social movements across the web.\nAhwaa.org - A bilingual platform for Arab LGBTQ youth that leverages game mechanics to protect and engage its community.\nBecause of the risks to participating members, security, privacy, and anonymity are core needs to each of the sites on Majal's platform. The group's beginnings date to 2006, when it was founded in Bahrain by Esra'a Al Shafei. Since then, Majal has introduced dozens of products, and now has a distributed team of 10 volunteers.\n\nMajal's work has been a tremendous success: myriad individuals have contacted Majal thanking it for giving them a place to be themselves in a relatively safe environment. Majal and Al Shafei have also received international recognition from the likes of the World Economic Forum, TED, and the Berkman Center at Harvard Law School for \"Outstanding contributions to the Internet and its impact on society.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Majal's mission and success have long made it a target for malicious actors attempting to take down its sites and break into its systems.\n\n### __Majal.org & Project Galileo — Defending oppressed voices from silencing attacks__\nIn mid-2018, concerted DDoS attacks on Migrant-Rights.org were taking a toll. Over a period of months the site was dealing with extended bouts of downtime and unreliability — members complained about being unable to upload a single video — with little sign of reprieve.\n\nThe stakes are high: if the services Majal offers are unavailable, the people who make up its communities face silencing isolation. There is the risk that in looking for another outlet for self-expression and community, they might settle for one of the many platforms that treat security and anonymity as afterthoughts — exacerbating the risk to their personal safety.\n\nIn the midst of these attacks, a supporter encouraged Al Shafei to contact Cloudflare's Project Galileo. Majal was quickly approved to become part of the program, and its network of sites is now protected by Cloudflare's [enterprise-grade security protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/solutions/enterprise-network-security/) and performance acceleration at no charge.\n\n\"That fixed it,\" Al Shafei says. \"After we moved onto Cloudflare, our site reliability was restored. Without Galileo, we'd have to invest a lot of money into getting the same kind of protection. We're a non-profit with very limited resources and we need to invest them wisely. For us to be able to get this level of protection from Cloudflare for free — it's a huge help.\"",

						"longDescription": "[Karma Insurance](https://www.karmainsurance.ca/) prepares to disrupt the Canadian insurance market leveraging Cloudflare's network to bring their customers high performance and online security. Karma Insurance is an insurtech startup based in Quebec, Canada. It was created with the firm belief that buying insurance should be simple and transparent. To achieve this mission, Karma Insurance built an online platform that enables Canadians to shop and buy life insurance without meeting an insurance broker in person, while still providing the full advice and support of a full service broker.\n\n__Karma Insurance's Challenges: Maintaining High Performance and Securing Customer Data__\n\nAs with any startup resources are not unlimited. Being technically savvy, Karma Insurance developed a complex strategy for deploying their infrastructure, however, they soon discovered that the resources needed to execute this plan would take away from developing their core business. Karma Insurance thus needed replacement solution. CTO, President & Co-Founder of Karma Insurance, Martin Bailey explained that \"Our requirements were Canadian Data Centers, DNSSEC, strict SSL, IPv6, HTTP/2, authenticated origin pulls, transparent firewall and customizable caching.\"\n\n__Karma Insurance's Solution: An Advanced Single Vendor Solution With Presence in Canada__\n\nKarma insurance was looking for a single vendor solution with presence in Canada for both web performance and security. \"We considered Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Sucuri and Incapsula\" said Bailey, \"In the last year, none of those services had a strong presence in Canada and today they're mostly limited to one city. They either target pure CDN functionality or pure WAF without the seamless integration of DNSSEC management and transparent proxying.\" Cloudflare, however, did meet those needs.\n\nCloudflare's security suite brought Karma Insurance peace of mind and helpful regulatory compliance. Bailey explained that \"As an insurance broker we have to prove that we take adequate precautions to prevent unauthorized access to our data. By allowing Cloudflare as the single user of our private cloud, we've eliminated entire classes of threat vectors and made our security that much simpler to prove.\" Additionally, Cloudflare's data centers in Montréal, Toronto, and Vancouver provided a regulatory advantage: \"Our clients really appreciate knowing their data stays in one legislation and it enables our regulatory compliance\" said Bailey.\n\nPerformance-wise Karma Insurance noticed immediate improvements when they switched to Cloudflare. Bailey explained \"Our largest US competitor has API delays of up to 5 seconds when a slider on their site is moved. With careful design to make our quoting API cacheable, the Cloudflare CDN at the edge helps us bring such latencies down to the 20ms range. That's a huge boost to our user experience. Our early testers keep asking us if they're seeing real, live data because information was appearing instantly.\"\n\n![karma-sliders](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6tl9PR8ri8OscsOCywmYGa/337cf39f4a30dc0928eeb73a961ca205/karma-sliders.png)\n*These sliders on Karma Insurance's website appear to instantly load despite pulling in live data from multiple insurance companies.*\n\nBailey concluded, \"Cloudflare checked all of our technical boxes inside a user friendly package with room for our hopefully rapid growth.\"\n",

With users all around the world AdGuard began to realize that the geographic dispersal of some of these users negatively impacted their experience with the product. Andrey Meshkov, CTO and Co-Founder of AdGuard noted \"the experience for most of our users, especially in Europe where we're based, was really great, but for others our servers were too far away. Additionally, we realized that some of our global users were experiencing connectivity problems with contacting our servers. Discovering our site was unavailable or slow performing for some of our users was the key moment when our need for a CDN service became apparent.\"\n\nA third challenge AdGuard faced was delivering the best Ad blocking possible to their users, while balancing the bandwidth costs it face as a result of doing so. Meshkov explained, \"Ad blockers' work by using special \"filters\" or lists of ad blocking rules that tell what should be blocked and where. To ensure high ad blocking quality, it is crucial to receive filters updates as soon and as fast as possible. In turn, this speed and frequency costs quite a lot of bandwidth.\"\n\n__AdGuard's Solution: The Fastest, Largest Network with Flat-Rate Prices__\n\n\"We considered a couple of Cloudflare's competitors,\" continued Meshkov, \"but none of them compared to Cloudflare's price and network size or ease-of-use and ease-of-setup.\" Today, AdGuard uses Cloudflare's CDN to cache and serve their website content, newest ad filters, and latest program updates. By serving content, like their filters and updates, from Cloudflare's data centers in %{DataCenterCount}+ cities, AdGuard was able to shave down their bandwidth bill despite serving over 150 TBs worth of data and offer their users a faster service. \"Cloudflare significantly improves website load time for all of our users,\" Meshkov delighted. \"Even for users in Europe, where the performance was already good the difference was significant — the site halved in load time. For our US users, it was even better: a 4x improvement in speed. Plus, the faster load times improved our search rankings bringing more leads and users to our business.\"\n\nAs an added bonus, Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation has been able to block every attack that AdGuard has seen. \"Though we weren't looking for a security product, we experienced a couple of DDoS attacks and Cloudflare really helped to block those.\"",

However, as common with a growing [ecommerce companies](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/), the more customers Touch of Modern had, the more valuable the sensitive payment and customer information that they store becomes to the likes of malicious agents. \"We started to get targeted by hackers trying to breach our site and access account information,\" Ou related. \"We save customer credit cards for reuse, which provides a more convenient shopping experience, but if a customer account got breached, it could result in unauthorized credit card charges, which would be a nightmare for both us and our customers.\"\n\n__Touch of Modern's Solution: A Security Provider with Built-in Speed__\n\nIn looking for a security provider, Touch of Modern found that Cloudflare's security suite offered the powerful security tools they needed with a high performing CDN (Content Delivery Network) at an unmatched price point. \"The combined cost of having security and CDN functionality from Cloudflare was more economical that just using the traditional CDN we previously had,\" Ou noted. \"Cloudflare helps keep us online, provides a faster site experience to our end users, and protects our customers sensitive information.\"\n\nTouch of Modern employs Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation and WAF (Web Application Firewall) to keep the site up and protected from attack as well as filter out malicious requests and prevent exfiltration of sensitive data. Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation has protected against some of the largest attacks ever launched on the Internet, so Touch of Modern is safely protected from volumetric attacks. Likewise, Cloudflare's WAF leverages the intelligence from the %{GlobalWebsiteCountWords}+ million Internet properties on the network, providing Touch of Modern with safety from even the latest known vulnerabilities and exploits.\n\nAdditionally, by combining the performance benefits of Cloudflare's CDN and Argo Smart Routing, Touch of Modern's site is dramatically faster for their end users. \"We turned Argo Smart Routing on and saw an immediate 27% speed improvement,\" Ou explained. \"Amazon says that every 100ms latency improvement leads to a 1% increase in conversion. With that logic, I estimate Argo provides us with a 5% bump in conversion.\" ",

Optimizing page load times of our marketing site and related web assets, 2. Protecting our web assets from potential DDoS attacks, and 3. Custom reverse proxy rules to allow routing traffic to different origin servers.\"\n\n\"Before we fully implemented Cloudflare,\" Ariotti continued, \"we were rendering a new static site in a nightly process in order to ensure fast response times for our users. While this approach did indeed result in very fast load times, it had major drawbacks: It constrained our ability to serve dynamic content, the deployment process was slow and error prone, and it did nothing to address our security needs.\"\n\n__Ivanti's Solution: The Fastest, Most Secure Network__\n\nIvanti came into existence from a merger of several companies, which meant relying on a complex infrastructure fulfilled by disparate vendors. \"Before Cloudflare, different parts of our organization were relying on a patchwork of providers to address their respective needs,\" Ariotti noted. \"We chose Cloudflare because it offered a comprehensive, cost-effective solution that checked all of our boxes.\"\n\nIvanti now uses Cloudflare for DNS, Content Delivery, Web Optimization, and Security. \"Having Cloudflare serve as a reverse proxy with POPs all around the world greatly enhances the robustness, performance and security of our web assets,\" Ariotti remarked. By utilizing a breadth of Cloudflare's services Ivanti is able to make their website faster and more secure. As a business, a faster site means a better user experience, making users more likely to use the product again or refer it to others.\n\nToday, Ivanti uses Cloudflare's WAF (Web Application Firewall) and Rate Limiting to protect their site and keep it up and running for their users. Cloudflare's WAF leverages threat intelligence from millions of Internet properties on the network, ensuring Ivanti is protected from the latest known vulnerabilities and attacks. Additionally, Ariotti articulated \"We are using Rate limiting currently to prevent a flood of requests that would result in 4xx or 5xx responses, which would allow an attacker to bypass the cache and potentially overwhelm the origin servers knocking our site offline.\" As a security software company, Ivanti knows the importance of keeping customer data safe and keeping Internet assets protected. Ariotti explained that \"We sell security software, so we know how important a business's reputation is in the security business. Cloudflare takes care of our site security helping keep up our reputation and allowing us to be more productive by focussing our resources on our core business.\"",

By fusing together a passion for fashion, music, sports, community empowerment, entertainment and other community-shaping topics, Villa strives to give their customers a high-energy, enjoyable shopping experience.\n\n__Villa's Challenge: Robots Buying Human Shoes__\n\nSneakers have long been at the helm of urban fashion and culture, and with the Jordan brand, one of the most recognized sneaker brands in the world, pulling in $2.8bn in revenue in 2016, sneakers are also serious business. With the sneaker culture favoring limited release, hard-to-find shoes, people have turned to writing bots to scrape the web for the latest shoe releases giving them a buying advantage over the usual customer. Though bot users still pay for the sneakers they're looking for, they hurt businesses by keeping in-demand shoes out of stock and ruining the performance of the sites they crawl.\n\n\"Bot Traffic hurts our customer experience because they can't buy the shoes they're looking for,\" explained Matthew Butch, Systems Engineering Manager at Villa. \"We want to sell to the customers that aren't trying to game the system. If we sell out of a shoe as soon as it's released because bots buy all of the units, then our customers don't come back to us the next time we have a release. As a business, we want to sell to the real customers because they're also adding other merchandise to their carts and coming back later to buy other products. The bots only look for a specific shoe and don't care where or how they get it.\"\n\nThe bots that crawl Villa's site also negatively affect the site's performance. \"Bots suck up the performance power of our servers,\" Butch continued, \"by constantly requesting pages, taking up data and request processing, all of which increases our infrastructure costs and degrades the shopping experience for our real customers. If a normal user visits our site and it's a slow, unpleasant they won't come back.\"\n\n__Villa's Solution: Bot Mitigation with Rate Limiting__\n\n\"Today we use Cloudflare's Rate-Limiting to block these bots and ensure we deliver a good experience for our users,\" Butch related. \"We have a few rules that rate limit based on the pages that are being requested and the geographic regions the requests are coming from, which have worked to give legitimate users a great shopping experiencing while blocking and banning the bots that hurt our business. As a result we've seen a tremendous reduction on the feedback we get on twitter, we have 15% fewer customer service complaints, and I, personally, don't spend time manually blocking IP's and looking at access rules, I just turn rate limiting on and my time is free to work on other important tasks.\"",

Users can subscribe to Bespoke Post to receive a new box every month, or they can choose boxes and products they like on the Bespoke Post website. With the tagline \"Goods and guidance for the modern man. ,\" Bespoke Post strives to deliver their customers the ultimate online shopping experience. \"I like to think of ourselves as curators that value both form and function\" explained Jared Hales, Director of Engineering at Bespoke Post, \"To showcase the great products we sell our site has to be pleasant to use and highly functional on any device.\"\n\n__Bespoke Post's Challenge: High Resolution Images, Traffic Spikes, and Mobile Optimization__\n\nFor [eCommmerce shops](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) like Bespoke Post, performance is critical to offering a pleasant user experience. \"Statistics about [site performance improvements](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) leading to higher conversion rates are always thrown around in our industry. We constantly aim to optimize our site to see those conversion gains,\" Hales explained. \"We have a lot of large, high-resolution images to show off our products in all their glory, but serving those images to our customers could mean slow site performance and high bandwidth costs.\"\n\nIn addition to performance challenges from a media-rich site, traffic spikes can also affect Bespoke Post's user experience. Hales related that \"because of the monthly nature of our service, the 1st day of the month is huge for us. The first of the month sees about 10-15x our normal traffic because that's when we announce the new products for the month. Likewise, In the first 5 days of the month, you can change or opt-out of your monthly shipment. So the majority of our subscribers are visiting the site during this window.\" While auto-scaling cloud infrastructure can handle to gradual increases in traffic, spikes like these often come too quickly and could overload the infrastructure making it slow or entirely unavailable for users.\n\n__Bespoke Post's Solution: Enlisting the Fastest, Most Secure Network__\n\nBespoke Post found Cloudflare's performance feature set to offer the exact solutions they were looking for. Cloudflare's CDN now caches and serves Bespoke Post's content from data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world, minimizing geographic latency by serving content (like large image files) from the data centers closest to users accessing the content. In turn, not only does Cloudflare's CDN improve the performance of Bespoke Post's site, but because users are being served from Cloudflare's cache, Bespoke Post's origin infrastructure is never overloaded and easily handles these spikes in traffic. Likewise, by also using Cloudflare's Argo Smart Routing and Tiered Caching services Bespoke Post's bandwidth consumption is further reduced, while their site performs over 33% faster for requests handled by Argo's Smart Routing.\n\n# __>33%__\n## __FASTER SITE PERFORMANCE__\n\nOn the security side, Bespoke Post has been greatly enjoying the peace of mind that comes with Cloudflare. \"Threats that could be problematic for us just get blocked at Cloudflare's edge,\" Hales remarked. \"We haven't had any issues since using Cloudflare.\"",

Plus, because 85% of our traffic comes from Google search, it is important for us to render and serve content as fast as possible. There is always the next Google search result that a user can go to, so we needed something that would make our site loads and is delivered as fast as possible.\"\n\n__Scotch's Solution: A Multi-Tooled Network with a Solution for Every Challenge__\n\n\"Cloudflare let us scale the business from when it was a WordPress site on a single server to what it is today,\" Sevilleja continued. \"We never had to worry about scaling our infrastructure and that let us focus on the things that made our business and product unique, the content.\"\n\nScotch now uses Cloudflare's CDN to improve site performance, load balancing to distribute traffic across servers, managed DNS service, Railgun and Rocketloader to improve dynamic content delivery, and Page Rules features to fine tune individual page behavior. Cloudflare's global network spans over %{DataCenterCount} cities, so when a student is trying to learn on Scotch, they get served content from the closest data center. In turn, the user experience on Scotch's site is quick and responsive, and Scotch saves in bandwidth costs because Cloudflare is serving their content. \"Cloudflare's services greatly increase the speed of our site and in turn, increase our pageviews, time on site, and key metrics that we track for our business,\" Sevilleja related. \"The time we've saved has been well worth it considering the effort that would've gone into building all the features ourselves.\"\n\nAdditionally, when Scotch began accepting payments, Cloudflare made payment processing compliance and implementing the necessary site security easy. \"Having HTTPS and SSL certificates is important for any site selling things online for both the site and its users.

Olo serves as the interface between the restaurant and the on-demand world, giving multi-location restaurants controlled integrations so they can efficiently accept orders from everything from apps to new customer interfaces like the Amazon Echo. Their mission, unchanged since their founding in 2005, is to provide customers with better, faster, more personal service from the restaurants they love. Today, Olo serves over forty million customers for takeout and delivery through branded restaurant apps and sites.\n\n__Olo's Challenge: SSL Certificates at Speed and Scale__\n\n\"As a white label service provider, most of our clients have custom domains for their ordering websites,\" explained Andrew Murray, CTO of Olo. \"We wanted to provide HTTPS on these custom domains without the overhead of clients having to approve certificates and us provisioning new IP addresses or load balancers for each domain.\" Providing HTTPS on these custom domains ensures that communications from these white-labeled sites to their respective customers are encrypted.\n\n## *\"Before Cloudflare...we had some rather unwieldy code to transfer a user's session...\"*\n\n\"Before Cloudflare,\" Murray continued, \"our clients' custom domains could only be used for plain HTTP landing pages, and we had some rather unwieldy code to transfer a user's session from a client's HTTP custom domain to our secure HTTPS wildcard domain (e.g. https://customername.olo.com), for checkout.\" This practice, however, was imperfect for a variety of reasons: First, search engines and browsers are penalizing HTTP sites by respectively lowering search rankings and displaying warnings to users of these sites. Furthermore, having to transfer domains in this fashion prevented the perfect white label experience Olo strives to offer its customers and complicated analytics and synchronizing cookies for these pages. Lastly, as Murray noted \"there is just really no good reason to serving any part of a website over HTTP anymore. Even landing pages without sensitive information are, in theory, subject to the on-path attacker attacks and eavesdropping for nefarious purposes.\"\n\n\"We'd considered a few options for fixing this flow,\" Murray explained, \"such as building our own infrastructure to serve Let's Encrypt certificates and manually coordinating certificate approval with clients. Thankfully, Cloudflare announced SSL for SaaS right at the time we were looking to make a decision so we looked into what they could offer.\"\n\n__Olo's Solution: SSL Certificates and Security Built for SaaS Companies__\n\nToday, Olo secures their white labeled webshops with SSL for SaaS and has entirely replaced their previous performance and security vendor with Cloudflare. \"Our engineers were happy to say goodbye to the unwieldy code,\" Murray remarked. \"With SSL for SaaS we have implemented a simpler flow because Cloudflare's API handles the provisioning, serving, automated renewal and maintenance of our customers' SSL certificates. Plus, end-to-end HTTPS now means we have bolstered privacy and performance for our customers, and can leverage browser features, like Local Storage, that we couldn't use before.\" Furthermore, these SSL improvements were made without having to change Olo's end-user implementation.\n\n## *\"Our engineers were happy to say goodbye to the unwieldy code...\"*\n\nOlo also makes use of Cloudflare's WAF (Web Application Firewall) and DDoS mitigation, which work in concert to make Olo sites more secure and protected from online attacks. \"A WAF is required by PCI-DSS so Cloudflare's WAF is essential to maintaining compliance for our service,\" Murray posited. \"We also use the WAF for blocking countries where we don't have customers and IP ranges where we see a large amount of malicious traffic coming from.\" Cloudflare's WAF also makes use of the intelligence from millions of Internet properties on Cloudflare's network so Olo is protected from the latest known vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Furthermore, Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation absorbs attacks aimed at Olo infrastructure ensuring sites are [always online and available](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/). \"Security is the #1 concern of most of our clients,\" Murray related. \"A more secure website both helps my team and I sleep better at night, and at the same time makes our annual PCI assessment easier!\"",

When Daily Caller implemented AMP for their platform, the performance results and page view numbers were awesome, but there was one challenge: they couldn't monetize links on these AMP enabled pages.\n\nRapid scale also came with some natural growing pains for Daily Caller. Previous methods of content delivery were topping out on performance and beginning to get expensive, while increased popularity and notoriety also meant Daily Caller was becoming a bigger and bigger target for DDoS attacks. Expensive bandwidth and downtime from attack can both be detrimental to a news publication offering its breaking news.\n\n__Daily Caller's Solution: AMP Pages Served Through Cloudflare & Monetized by VigLink__\n\nPublishers are constantly battling for revenue with search giants and content aggregators offering publisher content to readers before users ever get to the publisher's monetizable platform. Monetization is particularly difficult for publishers who want to leverage Google's AMP cache, which quickly serves AMP pages to the search engine's users, but serves them on a Google owned domain.\n\nDaily Caller found one revenue stream through a link-monetization partner, Viglink, that offers the ability for Daily Caller to monetize links on their pages by tracking clicks on Daily Caller pages through a proprietary Javascript snippet. However, AMP pages don't allow 3rd party javascript to be inserted, and with Google's AMP cache heavily regulated by the search provider, workarounds are almost impossible.\n\nVigLink identified Cloudflare's Ampersand as a way for publishers to earn from AMP pages and connected Daily Caller, one of their publishers, to this monetization solution. By providing a proprietary AMP cache, Ampersand allows publishers to have greater control over their AMP pages, meaning publishers like Daily Caller can manage the domain their AMP pages are served on, as well as how the pages are presented. In this case, Cloudflare helps Daily Caller use Viglink's link monetization by applying the relevant scripts through Viglink's API in the backend. Thus, Daily Caller not only gets faster mobile pages, but also gets to keep and maintain control and monetization of these pages. In the four weeks after deploying Ampersand, Daily Caller saw a 3X rise in mobile affiliated click traffic and a 10X rise in mobile revenue.\n\nThough Ampersand brought Cloudflare to Daily Caller's attention, Cloudflare's network of products including Content Delivery and DDoS mitigation were perfect solutions for Daily Caller's growing pains. Now Daily Caller's pages are served from Cloudflare's CDN (Content Delivery Network) at over 115 Cloudflare Data Centers around the world. End readers get served content from data centers closest to them, not only improving page load time by reducing geographic latency and requests to the origin, but also saving Daily Caller bandwidth.\n\nLikewise, Daily Caller's web properties are now protected by Cloudflare's state-of-the-art DDoS mitigation. Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation absorbs any attacks aimed at Daily Caller, and allows normal traffic to flow as usual. This protection ensures Daily Caller is always online offering readers the latest breaking news.",

						"longDescription": "Curse protects and enhances its gaming communities with Cloudflare.\n\n[Curse](https://www.curseinc.com/) builds communities around games to make gaming more enjoyable. Gamers come to Curse's sites to meet people playing games and exchange information on wikis for different games on different platforms. One of Curse's sites, Gamepedia, is the largest gaming wiki platform in existence. Through officially sanctioned wiki's with gaming companies and community made sites, Curse's sites see over 1 billion page views and reach over 50 million users every month.\n\n__Curse's Challenge: Fighting Attacks on Community Sites__\n\nGiven Curse's industry and service, their platform is a common target for online attack. Craig Bradberry, Production Systems Manager at Curse, explained \"We definitely see a higher number of attacks because we're involved with gaming. We have a younger user base on average than most sites, meaning that we see teenagers (who don't face any real risk of punishment) using a botnet or other form of malicious attack on our sites. It's made worse by the fact that that nobody outside of the space really cares that much about gaming sites, because we're not dealing with the sensitive information like a bank or an [ecommerce store](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) might process. We see these attacks for any reason; if people get upset in game, our sites are often targeted in retaliation.\"\n\n## *\"...we couldn't use on premise products because these DDoS attacks were getting so big...\"*\n\nThe types of attacks Curse sees knock community sites offline completely or make them slow and unusable. Most of these attacks are DDoS, or Distributed Denial of Service, attacks, which send more traffic to a site than it can handle, preventing information from coming or going from the sites origin server. \"Initially, at least weekly, if not daily, we were getting reflection attacks and people doing malicious attacks flooding our origin servers preventing the sites from being accessible by anyone,\" Bradberry explained. \"The DDoS mitigation appliance we had in place took care of these until the attackers started doing bandwidth based attacks. After that, we couldn't use on premise products because these DDoS attacks were getting so big that they were taking down the entire data center. They would use botnets so it was impossible to block manually. The only solution we had was to black hole a domain, but that's a pain because we had to redirect people to new IPs, and then the botnets just move to attacking the new IP.\"\n\n__Curse's Solution: State-of-the-Art Security__\n\nCurse found Cloudflare's security suite to be the perfect protection from these attacks. Cloudflare's Rate Limiting allows Curse to set limits on the number of times a given page can be hit by an IP address over a set amount of time. Bradberry posited, \"If we're having an issue where our software is being impacted by someone malicious, like a Layer 7 attack on our login page, Rate Limiting prevents that. Plus, the setup is easy and intuitive. It's really easy to go in and add another Rate Limiting rule and our jobs easier because you can make different rules along ATC response codes.\"\n\nCloudflare's DDoS mitigation also helps blocking Layer 3 and 4 attacks aimed at Curse. Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation has blocked some of the largest attacks seen on the Internet. It works by intelligently routing attack traffic away from origin servers, absorbing the traffic at Cloudflare's edge, instead of allowing it to overwhelm origin servers. \"Attacks that would otherwise make our site slow or entirely inaccessible get blocked by Cloudflare,\" commented Bradberry. \"Because of this protection the 1,600 sites we have on Cloudflare are kept online and our community keeps coming back to enjoy them.\"",

Their mission is to deliver the most-trusted, independent, Irish news service, accurate and impartial, for the connected age. They reflect Ireland's cultural and regional diversity and enable public access to major events.\n\n__RTÉ's Challenge: Protecting Their Trusted Reputation and Serving the News 24/7__\n\nBeing Ireland's most trusted news source, RTÉ has a responsibility to serve news to the people. This can be challenging, when there are malicious actors who want to take their site down. Michael Kennedy, Technology Infrastructure Manager at RTÉ, explained \"We're the most trusted source for news and current affairs content. In the event of an attack that took us offline, not only would it be embarrassing for the company, but it would upset the audience. People rely on RTÉ for news and current events.\" Kennedy continued, \"We had experienced a few small scale attacks in the last few years, none of which caused any impact on production services. However, the scale of these issues was growing: In December 2015 the BBC suffered a DDoS related outage, followed in January with numerous attacks against various Irish websites, including government sites. In a year with significant sporting events, a general election and the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising we needed to take measures to protect our services because we knew our current resources would not keep our sites online.\"\n\n__RTÉ's Solution: Easy to Deploy, Advanced Web Security__\n\nRTÉ ultimately chose to enlist Cloudflare's internet security services. As Kennedy puts it, \"We chose Cloudflare because other vendors are less featured, more complicated to use, and significantly more expensive. With Cloudflare we can deploy website changes easily and extremely rapidly. We can turn on features incrementally, getting basic protection on day one, while being able to turn on new features over time. Plus, when we need to turn on a feature it happens almost instantly, other providers took an hour or more. With no work required on our infrastructure we are able to support HTTP/2, and end-to-end TLS encryption. Cloudflare's interface is simple and intuitive, which makes it trivial to get new users to manage rules. And finally, the service is very affordable.\"\n\n## *\"We chose Cloudflare because other vendors are less featured, more complicated to use, and significantly more expensive. With Cloudflare we can deploy website changes easily and extremely rapidly...\"*\n\nCloudflare's security is not only easy to use and affordable, but it also fits RTÉ's requirements perfectly. \"Having not seen a DDoS since signing up, we are very happy.\" Kennedy stated, \"Knowing that in the event of a DDoS we can rapidly increase the protection level, or change page rules, gives us significant assurance that we can keep our public facing services online no matter what.\"",

As PicsArt grew and expanded, serving content from a single location could mean slow delivery and congested infrastructure, which would result in a poor experience for PicsArt's users. With that in mind, PicsArt set out to find a solution before it became an issue.\n\n__PicsArt's Solution: Content Distribution with Built-in Optimization and Protection__\n\nPicsArt knew that a Content Distribution Network (CDN) would solve their challenge and allow for seamless growth going forwards. Cloudflare's CDN now caches and serves PicsArt's content from data servers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world reducing geographic latency for PicsArt's global users, while also saving PicsArt Bandwidth. \"With Cloudflare's CDN the load time of our images improved by 2-3x and on top of that we're saving over 50% on our monthly bandwidth usage,\" noted Vardanyan.\n\n## *\"With Cloudflare's CDN the load time of our images improved by 2-3x and on top of that we're saving over 50% on our monthly bandwidth usage\"*\n\nThough PicsArt was only searching for a performance partner, they also saw the benefits of enlisting Cloudflare's security and protection. \"In the last month Cloudflare blocked over 675 million threats aimed at our infrastructure,\" Vardanyan explained. Cloudflare's protection is multi-fold: the Web Application Firewall (WAF) leverages collective security intelligence from millions of Internet properties on the network to protect PicsArt from the latest known vulnerabilities and malicious actors. Furthermore, Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation is designed to allow normal traffic to freely flow, while blocking and absorbing malicious traffic at Cloudflare's edge. This allows PicsArt to stay online and functioning for their users, even in the case of a massive online attack.\n\nVardanyan concluded: \"We chose Cloudflare because they are the best CDN provider for our business and scaling needs, with continuous innovation, new services and great support.\"",

With a focus on branded eCommerce the agency's partners reach an audience of over 30 million followers. \"We are vertically integrated to offer product development, product manufacturing, web design/development, marketing, paid advertising, fulfillment, and customer service,\" explained Chadd Gorney. \"Our customers, like [hip-hop artist Hopsin](https://www.undercoverprodigy.com/), reach audiences of millions of followers and our goal is to optimize sales funnels on these eCommerce sites through smart web development. Subscribing to the theory of least resistance, we design sites to be as fast as possible with 100% uptime. Slow sites don't fit into our model.\"\n\n__Chadd G Creative's Challenge: Protecting Customer Sites Without Losing Performance__\n\n\"With our previous provider we were having issues with DDoS attacks on our client websites,\" noted Gorney. \"These attacks are frustrating because they're hard to stop without outside support, they slow sites down or even bring them entirely offline, and ultimately can cost our clients tens of thousands of dollars in a single day.\" So, Gorney and team set out to find a vendor that would protect their customers sites without sacrificing their as-fast-as-possible methodology.\n\n__Chadd G Creative's Solution: All-in-One Performance & Security__\n\n\"Cloudflare was highly recommended to us by our new server administrator, so it was the first vendor we looked at actually\" Gorney related.

Cloudflare runs the largest, fastest managed DNS service in the world, making the DNS lookups for Chadd G Creative customers lightning-fast. Plus, Cloudflare makes DNS easy: \"another major benefit to me is managing all of my clients DNS from one location. Having 55 Godaddy accounts would have been a nightmare to deal with,\" said Gorney. In addition to the improved DNS performance, Cloudflare's CDN is now caching and serving Chadd G Creative's customer content from globally distributed data centers. This distribution of content serves to minimize geographic latency to the agency's customers' end users, meaning a faster, more enjoyable experience.

Every month, tens of thousands of students use Mystudenthalls.com to search across thousands of listings to pinpoint their future home-away-from-home.\n\n__Mystudenthalls' Challenge: Performance at global scale__\n\nMystudenthalls faced two challenges as the platform expanded and scaled. First, as the platform expanded to international users the Mystudenthalls team wanted to ensure a consistent experience for their new globally dispersed users. \"As international traffic continues to grow it's vital that our overseas users receive the same speed and experience as those based in the UK,\" explained Dan Roberts, founder and managing director of Mystudenthalls.com.\n\nSecond, as new listings are added to the Mystudenthalls platform, the site is still expected to load extremely quickly while serving more content to more people. Roberts noted \"Mystudenthalls is a very image heavy site and our users rightly expect these pages and images to load almost instantly. That begins to be difficult when both the number of users and the number of listings on our platform are growing at such a rapid rate.\"\n\n__Mystudenthalls' Solution: An Advanced, High Performance Global Network__\n\nRoberts and his team searched the market for a solution to their performance challenges. \"We did examine a number of options but the majority could not match Cloudflare's global coverage nor its additional features,\" related Roberts. Now, Mystudenthalls.com is accelerated and optimized through Cloudflare's Railgun, Argo, CDN, Mirage, and Polish services.\n\nMystudenthalls uses Cloudflare's Argo Smart Routing to deliver site content to their users as fast as possible. By leveraging the insights from millions of Internet properties on Cloudflare's network, Argo routes Mystudenthalls traffic on the highest performing, least congested pathways available. Mystudenthalls saw a 40% improvement on time-to-first-byte through Argo alone.\n\nWith Argo optimizing the routing of Mystudenthalls' traffic, Cloudflare's CDN further improves Mystudenthalls' global performance by caching and serving static content from data centers in %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world. By serving content closer to Mystudenthalls' global users, site load time is dramatically decreased, while Mystudenthalls is saving on bandwidth costs. Plus, by using Railgun Mystudenthalls' improves the delivery of their dynamic content by only pulling the parts of content that have changed from their origin servers with Cloudflare serving the unchanged parts directly from the cache.\n\nAdditionally, Mystudenthalls implemented Cloudflare's image optimization tools Mirage and Polish to make images load even faster. Roberts stated \"Mirage and Polish mean we can make sure that even on a slower connection, the user will be served those image assets at the speed they expect.\" Mirage works by storing two versions of an image the cache and then first serving a \"virtualized image\" (often 1% the size of the original image) until the original image can be loaded, which allows Mystudenthalls to give users full functionality of their site before all assets have completely loaded. Furthermore, Mirage optimizes images for the device they are being viewed on, serving smaller to mobile devices so that they load faster without sacrificing quality. Plus, Polish programmatically optimizes images removing metadata and reducing file size to serve images as quick as possible.",

Barn2's client portfolio includes London training company [Happy](http://www.happy.co.uk/), Paris-based biotechnology firm [Depixus](https://depixus.com/), and recruitment specialists [Advertise-a-Job.com](http://www.advertise-a-job.com/).\n\n__Barn2 Media's Challenge: Finding a Quick & Affordable Way to Speed Up Websites__\n\nBarn2 Media often use premade WordPress themes to keep costs down for their customers. However, these themes can be bloated behind the scenes making websites slow performing. Katie Keith, operations director at Barn2 Media, explained \"If you're using a big theme with several advanced plugins then there's a risk that your website will slow down. Slow page load times are bad news because they damage your SEO, put off your visitors, and increase bounce rates. Especially if it's an ecommerce site the cost of lost sales over time can easily outweigh the initial savings from using off-the-shelf themes and plugins. We needed a solution that would improve performance on our clients' websites without sacrificing the savings we were passing on from using the premade implements.\"\n\n__Barn2 Media's Solution: Lightning fast CDN with Strong Security__\n\nBarn2 Media discovered Cloudflare about 3 years ago after reading articles about it in WordPress news updates. \"For each client, we used the Pingdom page speed tool to measure the average page load time before and after setting up Cloudflare,\" noted Keith. \"For each website that we enabled Cloudflare on, we saw huge speed improvements. We recorded improvements of between 26-60%, with an average speed increase of 44% across all of our websites. For one of our sites simply turning on Cloudflare reduced the page load time from 6.36 seconds to 2.56 seconds. We were really surprised to see the greatest speed improvements for sites that had audiences located from far from origin server locations. Because Cloudflare's CDN serves the website content from a data center that it geographically close to each visitor site speed greatly improved. This is crucial for us as some of our clients are hosting their site in one location but targeting visitors across different continents. For example, we have clients with websites hosted in the UK wanting to attract a US audience and Cloudflare instantly improved the US performance of those sites.\"\n\nOn the security front Cloudflare allows Barn2 Media to keep customer website light and high performing while maintaining security at the edge. \"We try to avoid using extra WordPress security plugins, as they are often overkill and slow down people's websites,\" Keith explained. \"Instead, we make our clients' websites secure by following the latest WordPress security best practices and using Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation and Web Application Firewall (WAF).\" Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation is best in class with capacity to whether the largest attacks on the Internet. By leveraging anycast technology Cloudflare's global network is designed so data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities work together to protect customer's sites and customer origin IP's are obfuscated so only good traffic touches their servers. Keith noted \"We also enjoy that Cloudflare makes SSL so easy because SSL is quickly becoming a requirement across the internet. These security features give our clients extra peace of mind and help to protect their websites without having to pay for any additional security.\"",

GetInsured provides comprehensive ecommerce solutions for insurers to reduce administrative costs and scale membership, and they also work with employers to reduce healthcare costs while still connecting employees with the health insurance coverage they deserve. Their private exchange solutions simplify today's health insurance enrollment complexities and personalize the shopping experience for consumers, enabling them to make more informed decisions.\n\n__GetInsured's Challenge: Streamlining Technical Compatibility, While Bolstering Security__\n\nGetInsured continually works to optimize and simplify its outward facing platform, while also working behind the scenes to make sure the sensitive information passing through their systems is as safe and secure as possible. \"Defense-in-depth is one of the core tenets for securing our applications and is necessary for our business to function,\" explained Atul Arora, Security Architect at GetInsured. \"Our previous firewall was not performing very well. We were having tremendous challenges with getting it online and maintaining stability. In addition, managing multiple SSL certificates for our production and QA environments across different products and customers was a challenge for us, especially as our user base kept growing. We wanted something that would just work right out-of-the-box that was scalable, user-friendly and secure.\"\n\n__GetInsured's Solution: An All-in-One Solution That Works Out of the Box__\n\n\"We started using Cloudflare just for their WAF, but we really enjoyed how everything just worked so we looked into the other features of the network,\" said Allwyn Lobo, CIO at GetInsured. \"We now use Cloudflare's WAF, Page Rules and DDoS mitigation features to augment and strengthen our defenses.\"\n\n![getinsured-graphic](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5IL6afbmlGuwmgCKAgc24i/92822509a4d794223af96f7a588c233b/getinsured-graphic.png)\n\nThese added security features proved formidable to attackers: \"Since using Cloudflare we have seen a lot fewer DoS or DDoS attacks reported by our firewall,\" explained Lobo. This reduction is due to the fact that Cloudflare's DDoS protection is best-in-class and [has stopped the largest attacks seen on the Internet](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-winter-of-400gbps-weekend-ddos-attacks/) ensuring that attacks aimed at GetInsured are futile. Plus, Cloudflare's WAF works by analyzing every packet aimed at GetInsured's infrastructure and automatically blocks malicious requests or requests from blocklisted IP addresses. GetInsured also leverages the country blocking feature of the WAF to minimize the surface area for attacks and ensure an even higher level of security. \"Before using Cloudflare we had to respond to and review tickets to add rules to block IPs,\" related Lobo. \"Now blocking countries efficiently keeps the bad actors away, and our IT and InfoSec teams have time to focus on other pressing issues.\"\n\nIn addition to the bolstered security, GetInsured enjoys the ease-of-use and overall value they get from Cloudflare. \"The Cloudflare product is easy to use,\" noted Lobo. \"It has smart system defaults, a modern web-based application, and rich and informative dashboards. \"\n\nLobo concluded, __\"It's difficult to find a single, easy-to-use product this rich in features and functionality.\"__",

The platform promotes tourist destinations and assists entrepreneurs developing travel and leisure services throughout Brazil and Latin America. The more hotels, packages, and activities that Hotel Urbano can offer through its platform, the more consumers will be interested in the service. That's why it is so important for them to have the best technology behind their platform so users have an enjoyable experience and providers sell more packages.\n\n__Hotel Urbano's Challenge: Bolstering for Black Friday Web Traffic__\n\nThis past Black Friday Hotel Urbano was hopeful that their promotions would drive millions of customers to their site, but the developer team had concerns that this spike in traffic might overload the site making it temporarily unresponsive or even completely unavailable. A compromised site would mean unhappy customers and a drop in sales on one of the highest revenue days of the year. Carlos Rios, CTO at Hotel Urbano, explained \"I have read that for every millisecond in latency on your site you lose one customer. I knew our Black Friday promotion would bring a huge spike in traffic, and that meant we needed a solution to keep our site high performing while handling the unusual load.\"\n\n__Hotel Urbano's Solution: Minimizing Strain on Servers, While Securing and Enhancing Site Content__\n\n\"Our ex CTO was a previous Cloudflare user, so when this Black Friday promotion came up, I looked into what solutions they could offer\" recounted Rios. \"With Cloudflare's Always Online feature I knew we could continue to serve our content directly from Cloudflare's cache, even if something were to happen to our origin servers.\" Cloudflare's Always Online feature works by serving a cached version of Hotel Urbano's site in the case that origin servers are knocked offline. That means in the event of a compromised server instead of seeing a error page consumers still get access to Hotel Urbano's content. Plus, by caching and serving Hotel Urbano's static content Cloudflare's CDN dramatically decreases server load reducing the likelihood of a compromised server.\n\nIn addition to this improved site resiliency Hotel Urbano also enjoys the benefits of Cloudflare's full-feature network with powerful security tools. Rios commented \"At the time we were looking there weren't any other options that were both as affordable, but also as full featured. Cloudflare's WAF ensures our site is protected against layer 7 attacks, and the savings we get as a result of Cloudflare's caching is immense.\"",

In this video, Shawn Zeller, principal architect at NatureBox, explains how they use Cloudflare to reduce latency for their site and ensure sensitive customer data is secure.\n\n__Transcript:__\n\n*\"I'm Shawn Zeller, principle architect at NatureBox. We make good food delicious by taking simple, good-for-you ingredients, and package them into products that we think our customers will really enjoy. You can find our products on our website and also at major retailers like Safeway and Target.*\n\n*Having a quick website is very integral to us being able to sell a product online. People, you know, if you're clicking on a Facebook ad and you end up on the website, you expect that to load quickly on your phone, you expect to be able to purchase quickly. If we're not able to get the customer's attention almost immediately, they're gonna go off, browse another Facebook article, they're gonna do something else, and so we need to deliver a very fast experience in order to actually turn that into a purchase.*\n\n*A big portion of us trying to maintain a fast website is being able to cache as much as humanly possible. So we use Cloudflare as an example, to cache all of our non-customer specific data, so including our entirety of our product catalog, inventory, etc. so that we can deliver those responses to the customer as fast as possible.\nWhen we started with Cloudflare one of our main API requests for our catalog data was taking on average 20 seconds. That tremendously impacted our customer response times. After using Cloudflare, we were able to move that down to be a completely edge cached response that took on the order of 35 milliseconds. That was a 17x reduction in actual response time, and improved overall latency and overall response times of all of our requests.*\n\n*So one of the main issues for an eCommerce website is trying to maintain things like PCI compliance, which is very important for how we're dealing with our own customers' financial data whether that's credit card data, etc. You know, we use all of the Cloudflare web application firewall-specific functionality in order just to make sure that our customers' data has an extra level of security outside of what we build into the application.*\n\n*I mean from our end the best thing about being able to use Cloudflare is that we can use just one solution for all of those things. We use Cloudflare for DNS, we use it for CDN, and we use it for web application security.*\n\n*So being able to use one solution for all of those just makes it a way less overhead for us in terms of managing it, documenting how we're using it, and trying to teach new people as they come on board the team how to use that application.*\n\n*If we didn't have Cloudflare we'd probably be having to do this directly in the application level. Or we would have to purchase some number of other applications, other network hardware, that we'd have to all configure, have to deal with on a daily basis.*\n\n*If you had to compare Cloudflare to a Naturebox Snack, what would it be?\nCloudflare to a snack...it would be the White Cheddar and Caramel Popcorn. Because you get a couple different flavors and it also tastes good.\"*",

In this video, Jager McConnell, CEO of Crunchbase, walks through how his company succeeds with Cloudflare.\n\nTranscript:\n*\"I am Jager McConnell, CEO of Crunchbase. Crunchbase is the world's leading provider of private company information on the internet. We have over 30 million users coming to us, using us for finding their next investment, finding their next investor. Even salespeople going and finding their next opportunity all within Crunchbase.*\n\n*You know, when we break a news story, when we have a new funding event happening that's a big deal, tons of traffic comes into Crunchbase. And those are the most critical times for us to stay up. If we go down, our users would be disappointed. They would go find that news somewhere else. And that's when we honestly rely on Cloudflare at the most.*\n\n*I don't have the bandwidth or the headcount to go and have a huge team trying to keep our servers up all the time, trying to mitigate those attacks. And that's when you go and turn to a vendor to go and say, \"Look, this is your core competency. Please do that for us because you're gonna do better than we can.\"*\n\n*From the CDN perspective, 92% of our traffic goes to the CDN servers. So they don't actually touch our origin servers. It's pretty amazing. That means that when those spikes happen, the traffic is distributed across that entire network of servers. Which not only saves us bandwidth and that ultimately saves us cost, but also from an end user perspective, things are super fast, and that makes them happy.*\n\n*Cloudflare allows us to go and look like we have a huge international presence by having over %{DataCenterCount} different data centers worldwide. We go and essentially push our data out to those sort of edge servers. And that allows from our end user perspective to have a faster experience because the servers are right next to them, right? So there are very few hops. So even though they're in Australia or in Asia, they have an incredible experience using Crunchbase because of that CDN.*\n\n*The most critical thing is that they can rely on us. They know that when they go to Crunchbase.com, they find the thing that they expect in having that server up and running. Cloudflare lets us deliver on that promise that expectation that the user has by being up and running.*\n\n*So when you are a large website, you have a huge target on your back. So Cloudflare helps us go and mitigate that risk with their DDoS mitigation, with their WAF protection. Just last month, we had over 1,600 different attacks.*\n\n*You know, it's funny; lots of people crawl us, as you might imagine. Like, when we're a data set, people go and try to find or get our information in whatever way they can. But what's funny is that sometimes, they're not the best coders when they try to go and write those crawlers.*\n\n*So what it actually becomes a DDoS attack where it's one IP trying to just get as much information on the same page over and over and over, millions and millions of requests. And they don't even probably intend to be doing that. We see those sorts of attacks all the time. And that's, again, where Cloudflare can step in and just make sure that doesn't happen.*\n\n*And that is an important thing for us from a security standpoint. Obviously with all of these hackers trying to do ransomware and trying to take down our servers, having the Cloudflare protection there ensures that we are safe and honestly, I think the hackers just go somewhere else when they see Cloudflare protecting our servers.\"*",

Hosting more than 500,000 domains in 5 data centers on 3 continents, speed, security and support are the three essential pillars of SiteGround's hosting service as they strive to provide the best of each to their customers.\n\n\"Providing clients with the best website speed and security possible has always been a priority for us,\" explained Nikolay Todorov, Chief Technical Officer of SiteGround. \"SiteGround was growing fast, so we needed partners that could help us scale quickly and efficiently. Partnerships like the one we have with Cloudflare allow us to do just that, while also helping us improve the product we provide and make it more valuable for our clients by giving them easy access to a service they would normally have to seek out on their own.\"\n\n__An Easy Partnership__\n\n\"Before choosing Cloudflare we considered a couple of other popular CDN companies, but Cloudflare's solution matched our needs best. Cloudflare offered both a reliable CDN service to complement our already strong in-house performance offerings and a powerful set of security features to bolster the security of our customers' sites. The other solutions were too complicated or were only affordable for big, enterprise clients without offering any serious advantages. We wanted a solution that we could offer to all of our clients including small to middle-size businesses, without any compromises on quality, reliability, performance, or security.\"\n\n> __\"Cloudflare is unquestionably a reliable and trusted partner for us...\"__\n\n\"Cloudflare is unquestionably a reliable and trusted partner for us,\" stated Todorov. \"Thanks to Cloudflare's collaborative spirit and willingness to work closely with us, we succeeded in creating the most beneficial plan for our customers and have continued to expand that plan over time. In 2013, a year after we launched the integration with Cloudflare, we added support for Railgun which is one Cloudflare's advanced performance features. More recently we added Cloudflare's WAF security feature.\"\n\nBecause of Cloudflare's positive impact for their customers SiteGround worked to make it easy for their customers to quickly begin using Cloudflare. Todorov noted \"We designed a special interface for Cloudflare's features that helps our clients see the feature in context, navigate to it with a single click, and start using it instantly.\"\n\nOften times integrating a new partner can be difficult, but Cloudflare worked to ensure SiteGround's onboarding was as easy as possible. \"When implementing new software in the beginning it is normal to have difficulties,\" said Todorov. \"Luckily, whenever we experienced any issues, the Cloudflare team was very easily approachable and quick to react. That's what is more important to us – knowing that we have a trusted partner whom we can turn to at all times. We had and continue to have smooth communication with Cloudflare and they are always fast to address any questions or issues as they occur.\"\n\n__Maximal Performance, Security, and Support for Customers__\n\nThe SiteGround customers most attracted to Cloudflare are mainly people and organizations with websites that have a lot of media content, high traffic volume, and a global visitor base.\n\n# 50-60%\n### __FEWER REQUESTS TO ORIGIN SERVERS__\n\"CDN is definitely the feature we love the most!\" exclaimed Todorov. \"Cloudflare gives us the most reliable CDN infrastructure with multiple and ever-growing data center count that serve to make our clients' websites load quickly for visitors from every region.\" Cloudflare has data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world that cache and serve content from SiteGround customers' websites. By serving content closer to the websites end user, geographic latency is reduced and web page performance is dramatically increased. \"Prior to implementing Cloudflare's services,\" explained Todorov \"we didn't offer a CDN service for our clients' websites. Since implementing it, we managed to reduce the load time for all of the websites hosted on our platform, and reduce between 50-60% of the number of requests we served directly from our origin servers.\"\n\n\"Along with CDN, the most beneficial added benefit of Cloudflare's service is the DDoS mitigation, which protects our customers' websites from Denial-of-Service attacks trying to take them offline. Plus, our security is even further enhanced with Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF), which we just added to our service offering. In fact, most of our clients choose to upgrade their plan because of the benefits of the Web Application Firewall, especially our customers who build their websites with applications like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and Magento by leveraging Cloudflare's always-up-to-date ruleset.\"\n\nTodorov concluded: \"Cloudflare complements our business by helping us increase sites' performance, security, and support. Тhese three points are the key pillars of SiteGround's services. Thanks to our partnership with Cloudflare, we managed to strengthen the speed and security measures for our clients even more.\"",

With millions of active users Gyazo is the largest, fastest screenshot and screen-GIF creation tool in the world.\n\n__Gyazo's Challenge: Optimize Uploading for Global User Base__\n\nInitially, all of Gyazo's servers were based in the United States and Gyazo used a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to distribute their content to users. Gyazo's users are roughly split 45% in Europe, 15% in Asia, and 40% in the United States, so this strategy worked well for users in the US, but users outside of US noticed extreme upload times. \"That's because CDN's are great at distributing content,\" explained Isshu Rakusai, CEO of Nota, the maker of Gyazo, \"but they aren't good for uploading content. Some of our users, in Australia for example, were seeing upload times over 30 seconds just to upload a small screenshot.\" That upload latency was due to the fact that content from the example Australia Gyazo user was being routed through South Asia, across the Pacific Ocean, to one of Gyazo's servers somewhere in the US and then back across the same route.\n\nTo combat this issue Gyazo built out its own network of upload edge servers around the world, but that lead to a further issue: These edge servers would experience spikes in traffic, and then have degraded performance when they were being used most.\n\n__Gyazo's Solution: Global Load Balancing With Failover__\n\nGyazo saw Cloudflare's Early Access program for Load Balancing and thought it might provide the complementary functionality needed to perfect their proprietary solution. Cloudflare's Global Load Balancing now intelligently sends traffic from Gyazo's users to the nearest and healthiest upload server, which ensures that users are experiencing the fastest upload speeds possible and servers are not getting overloaded.\n\n![gyazo-graphic](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6lIoA4gbzauWuMg4ckGoeM/a1b461fd0d79bdfabc691d60a1583c6c/gyazo-graphic.png)\n\nFurthermore, by distributing traffic and maintaining server health, Load Balancing ensures Gyazo's users don't see the degraded performance that they were initially experiencing. Plus, with the Failover feature of Load Balancing, Gyazo's users are rapidly rerouted when a server goes down so they don't even notice if a server failed. \"Failover was also very helpful for us,\" explained Rakusai, \"With our previous DNS provider, we created a quick hack to do DNS based Failover, but this was complicated to set up, and changes took hours to fully propagate.\"",

Christiaan Mourik, Head of Technology at de Bijenkorf, explained that \"de Bijenkorf had a couple of minor outages on the site and when we did some analysis, we found out the outages were caused by a low level SYN flood attack. We then received an email from a hacking group asking for bitcoins. Knowing our competitors had faced similar attacks, securing a DDoS mitigation solution became a top priority for us. Just a single day of being offline could cost us significant revenue.\"\n\nWhile searching for DDoS mitigation to keep their site up, de Bijenkorf realized that they could also incorporate a Content Distribution Network (CDN) as a high performing backbone for their new web architecture.

Offering a full-featured spot trading platform for the major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, monero, zcash, and more, hundreds of millions in transaction volume go through Bitfinex's platform every month (almost $735mm in transaction volume in the 30 days up to March 1, 2017).\n\n![bitfinex-volume-graph](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/RoOWo7QT0ieU6uQ2uyOsY/de402ad4638c8167e6cbd90b15e2c918/bitfinex-volume-graph.png)\n\n__Bitfinex's Challenge: High Performance With Strong Security__\n\nAs a high-frequency, financial trading platform, Bitfinex has two key priorities: speed and security. Speed is crucial for Bitfinex users because they need to have the latest cryptocurrency prices available to rapidly trade throughout the day. To ensure users get this information, Bitfinex is focussed on providing the fastest User Interface possible. To do so, Bitfinex set up a series of distributed front-end servers, which act as a user's first point of contact with their platform. However, this solution lead Bitfinex to a different challenge: these frontend servers would occasionally get overwhelmed by spikes in traffic, and as a result, users would experience slow, degraded performance. Bitfinex thus needed a way to evenly distribute traffic across these servers to avoid overload and ensure users were enjoying the fastest speeds possible.\n\nSecurity is a constant focus for any financial institution to ensure. For a web-based platform like Bitfinex, a breach in security could mean service down time, which is especially problematic for a high-frequency platform. \"Bitfinex is a highly available, high frequency trading platform,\" explained Adam Chamely, Developer at Bitfinex. \" If customers can't access our platform, they can't trade. If they can't trade on our platform, they'll go elsewhere; we lose them as a customer and we lose their trading volume, which puts us in a worse position and means we could lose even more.\" Bitfinex had engaged a previous security provider, but was beginning to grow frustrated with a constantly changing pricing structure.\n\n__Bitfinex's Solution: Cloud-Based, Secure Load Balancing__\n\n\"I've known about Cloudflare for quite a while, and other team members had used the service, so we decided to see if they could help solve our challenge,\" said Chamely. \"We considered rolling out our own solution, but at the end of the day Cloudflare's solution was more attractive: an existing platform that worked and allowed us to focus on developing our own offerings instead of reinventing the wheel.\"\n\nBitfinex now uses Cloudflare's Load Balancing to intelligently distribute traffic across their front-end servers. Chamely noted, \"We use Cloudflare Load Balancing to split up traffic among our front-end servers to increase our network capacity and ensure these servers are healthy. We also appreciate that Failover seamlessly routes traffic to a healthy server in case that server goes offline. Both of these ensure the high availability and uptime we need in our platform.\"\n\nBitfinex also now enjoys security from Cloudflare's advanced suite of security features. With IP reputation data from millions of Internet properties on its network, Cloudflare's WAF (Web Application Firewall) blocks malicious requests from touching Bitfinex's servers. Furthermore, Cloudflare's best-in-class DDoS protection ensures that Bitfinex's platform is protected from even the largest DDoS attacks on the internet. This protection gives Bitfinex peace-of-mind, and ensures their customers don't have to worry about the platform being unavailable or compromised.",

Buycraft offers users an extensive control panel, providing customers with the ability to easily set up online stores, process payments and subscriptions, and understand their customers through detailed analytics.\n\n__Buycraft's Challenge: Mitigating Attacks at an Affordable Price__\n\n\"DDoS attacks are incredibly common in this industry,\" explained Lee McNeil, CTO of Buycraft, \"Minecraft servers are very competitive, it could be the case that one server pays a team to knock another server offline in hopes of getting the players from that server to come to theirs.\"\n\nUnderstanding the current state of their industry, Buycraft invested in DDoS protection from the start of their service. However, when they faced a small DDoS attack, their purchased protection didn't mitigate the attack they were facing. \"We had agreed on a fixed price per month for unlimited DDoS protection,\" continued McNeil, \"but when we were hit with a relatively small 10gbps attack, our site went down, and our previous provider demanded more money. We were effectively held to ransom by our security provider, and while we were able to come up with a short term fix, we knew we needed to find a new long-term solution.\"\n\n__Buycraft's Solution: Rate Limiting From an Advanced Security Provider__\n\nAfter researching security providers Buycraft found Cloudflare as an effective and affordable security solution. McNeil delighted, \"Cloudflare is a great product for upcoming startups who don't have the resources to protect themselves in-house. We love the peace of mind that we get knowing that we can set up Cloudflare, forget about it, and trust that we won't be affected by any kind of malicious DDoS attack.\"\n\nWhat's more, Buycraft decided to enroll in Cloudflare's Early Access program for Rate Limiting, which gives users fine grained control over the traffic that comes to their site. \"We thought Rate Limiting would help protect against the increasingly common Layer 7 attacks we were seeing. So we specified a limit on the number of requests per second a given IP could make before it was blocked for a few hours.\" When Buycraft turned Rate Limiting on, Cloudflare blocked 20 million malicious requests and their service experienced zero interruptions. \"We didn't even know we were under attack,\" commented McNeil, \"until I logged into the dashboard and saw the requests that were being Rate Limited. This is great for our service because without that protection our site would be down and we wouldn't be able to process any transactions.\"",

Crisp targets the unpenetrated markets of Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, where a customer relationship solution doesn't exist or customers are in need of replacing outdated and expensive legacy technology.\n\n__Crisp's Challenge: Ensure Global Performance While Maintaining Local Infrastructure__\n\nAs Crisp expanded, they wanted to minimize additional overhead by maintaining their European based infrastructure, while still providing customers with a high performing platform. Valérian Saliou, CTO at Crisp, explained that \"We initially had a lot of issues with latency in Asia because it took time for the dynamic content of our chat application to go back and forth between the user and our servers in Europe. We've been using Cloudflare's CDN from day one, which immediately helped improve the delivery of static assets by a couple of seconds, but we were still looking to optimize the delivery of our dynamic content through an solution that would allow us to maintain our European infrastructure.\"\n\n![crisp-avg-load-time](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1R0I0ZxcgsCa6606G0eUuY/aa8f4ec52cda5cd9c23bc59217805f85/crisp-avg-load-time.png)\n\n__Crisp's Solution: A Cloud-Based, Global Load Balancer__\n\nWhen Crisp saw Cloudflare's Load Balancing Early Access offering, they opted into the program to see if they could leverage it to help with the latency they were seeing with dynamic content. Cloudflare's Global Load Balancing routes Crisp's customers to the origin server closest to them, which not only shortens the distance content needs to travel, but also allows for cryptographic termination closer to the end user—ensuring minimal latency for the end user. The results were better than Crisp could've hoped— \"When we rolled out Cloudflare Load Balancing,\" Saliou explained \"to route traffic across our atlas of websocket servers (tunneled into our core infrastructure through a VPN), we immediately got messages from customers in Asia and Oceania thanking us for the improvement.\" __With Load Balancing, Crisp saw latency times of their dynamic content drop an additional 2-3 seconds__. Plus, with Health Checks and Failover built into Cloudflare Load Balancing, Crisp's customers enjoy continual unfettered performance through Crisp's ability to monitor the health of their websocket servers and automatically shift traffic to healthy servers when a server is experiencing poor performance.\n\nWhen Crisp released their API to the public, they also saw the benefits of Cloudflare's Page Rules and DDoS protection. \"We default to Cache Everything to help save on bandwidth, and then use Page Rules to specify exceptions for our API and different TTLs for certain services\" Saliou explained. Furthermore, Crisp enjoys the protection they have for their API with Cloudflare's DDoS protection. Saliou continued, \"So far we've stopped 2 attacks that were trying to take our API offline with I'm Under Attack Mode, and didn't experience any disruption in service.\"\n\nSaliou concluded that \"Even if we didn't consider cost, which was a big factor in our decision-making, Cloudflare still outperforms competitors in terms of service, onboarding and ease of use.\"",

He is well known for both his Internet security blog [www.troyhunt.com](https://www.troyhunt.com/), and his [HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP)](https://www.haveibeenpwned.com/) service, which aggregates data breaches and helps people establish if they've been impacted by malicious activity on the web. Hunt's goal is to help as many people as possible with his knowledge and service.\n\n__Troy Hunt's Challenge: Helping People Without Enabling the Bad Guys__\n\nHelping as many people as possible can be difficult when resources are limited. A major challenge for Hunt is managing rapid spikes in traffic to his websites and API running on Microsoft's Azure infrastructure. These spikes cause performance issues, increase bandwidth costs, and mean down time and loss of confidence for a service where trust and integrity are everything. When data breaches at large institutions get highly publicized (like the recent Ashley Madison and Dropbox breaches) Hunt's HIBP service sees huge spikes in traffic. According to Hunt these traffic spikes \"max out the CPUs and degrade performance until more instances are put on. Autoscale, Azure's automatic load handling, works beautifully when traffic ramps up steadily, but I'm going to take a performance hit when traffic suddenly goes off the charts.\" Not only do these traffic spikes mean performance loss, but also because autoscale adapts to load on demand the spikes act as direct levers attached to Hunt's wallet.\n\nAdditionally, Hunt was worried about some actors maliciously using HIBP's API. While the API was created to help people find out if they've been impacted by a data breach, Hunt explained that \"recently there have been various indicators that the API has been used in ways that aren't in keeping with the spirit of why it was created. . . It's not something that I want to see continuing.\"\n\nHunt was thus looking for a solution to maintain web performance and mitigate costs in the wake of traffic spikes and prevent his API from being abused.\n\n__Troy Hunt's Solution: Rate Limiting Malicious Actors__\n\nTroy Hunt found a single solution for his multiple requirements in Cloudflare's Rate Limiting service. Rate Limiting helps Hunt manage traffic spikes by allowing him to set a limit on the number of requests from individual IP addresses that respectively hit his websites and API over a given period of time. Rate limiting prevents spikes in traffic from reducing performance because each unique user is limited to a certain number of requests. Hunt has set this limit such that normal users don't see any change in service, while people abusing Hunt's websites and API get throttled ensuring that his API stays high performing and reliable for legitimate traffic, while abusers are prevented and blocked. Hunt applauded, __\"You have made the entire site more stable, faster for legitimate users, and more secure while reducing my costs.\"__",

Bidu's main business goal is to bring insurance to the modern age by incorporating the latest technology into their product to make getting insurance as easy as possible.\n\nRenato Menegasso, Head of Technology at Bidu, related that for Bidu \"it's not just about selling insurance, but selling it with knowledge and clarity to the customer. We want people to understand the fine print and know what they are buying.\"\n\n__Bidu's Challenge: Speed & Security Fit for the Insurance Industry__\n\nBidu started an initiative to improve their SEO (search engine optimization) to ensure that they had the highest possible placement in front of the eyes of potential customers. During this process Bidu learned that slow performance and site latency were bringing down search ranks. Menegasso explained \"Speed is necessary to show that we're a reliable website and we have what it takes to do business online.

In addition, Bidu's website performance has improved dramatically as the result of serving content to customers from Cloudflare's proximally located Latin American data centers and through Cloudflare's support of faster, more secure HTTP/2. These performance improvements have resulted in Bidu's time to first byte (with more stability pulling from the cache) dropping from 8s to an average of 1s, and full page load times dropping from 13 seconds to an average of only 2.3s. Menegasso credits Bidu's 30% more leads YoY directly to the performance benefits from Cloudflare.\n\n# 30%\n### __MORE LEADS YEAR-OVER-YEAR__\nAdditionally, Cloudflare's WAF (Web Application Firewall) and extensive IP reputation filtering help Bidu identify and block malicious traffic to their site, keeping it more secure and reliable for their users.\n\nMenegasso concluded, \"With Cloudflare's performance and security improvements, our customers are happier, and our business is better off!\"",

						"longDescription": "Active Solutions helps their customer, Great Rail Journeys, extend their vacation platform globally by using Cloudflare's Load Balancing.\n\n[Great Rail Journeys](http://www.greatrail.com/) is the UK's leading seller of holidays by rail, making it easy for customers to browse and book trips online. Great Rail Journeys is actively expanding their customer base internationally to the United States and Canada. They hope to continue expanding their catalogue and eventually deliver services globally.\n\n__Great Rail Journeys' Challenge:__\n\nAs Great Rail Journeys expanded internationally, they recognized a few technical challenges that they would need to overcome to continue delivering their customers a premium user experience. Initially, in order to reduce geographic latency to new regions, Great Rail Journeys set up origin servers in both Chicago and London to serve content from locations closer to their new clientele. However, Great Rail Journeys still needed support to [securely optimize](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) the distribution of their content across these new origin servers. \"When we looked to expand internationally, we noticed our previous CDN provider didn't offer global coverage, geolocation for DNS or Load Balancing\" explained Nigel Hepworth Managing Director at [Active Solutions Limited](http://www.asolution.co.uk/), the Agency supporting Great Rail Journeys. \"We could have supplemented our existing CDN and WAF providers with even more additional vendors, but we were hoping we could find a single-vendor solution to meet all of our needs.\"\n\n__Great Rail Journeys' Solution:__\n\nAfter researching potential options Active Solutions, found that Cloudflare was the perfect solution for their customers requirements. \"Alternatives were large, expensive, and made cumbersome by old technology\" related Hepworth. \"They lacked the sophistication that Cloudflare has. Multiple vendors also means multiple dashboards to monitor Great Rail Journeys' site and multiple customer support teams to contact if there was an issue. Now we can see everything in a single dashboard, and we can all sleep at night knowing we have one vendor, Cloudflare, who is going to keep our customer's site online.\"\n\n![rail-case-study-graphic](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6LxWZvw5rO2sIsocuQuGiG/67c5850021f4068fd61fb5871d9436a4/rail-case-study-graphic.png)\n\nActive Solutions uses Cloudflare's Load Balancing to ensure that Great Rail Journey's site is resilient and high performing globally. Hepworth noted, \"the Failover feature of Load Balancing was important for us because it ensures Great Rail Journeys' customers don't notice a difference in the case that a local origin server goes down.\" Cloudflare's Load Balancing actively monitors Great Rail Journeys' origin servers and when an origin server goes down, traffic is rapidly rerouted to healthy servers so their customers don't notice a difference.\n\nFurthermore, because Cloudflare's Load Balancing implements Geolocation based routing, Great Rail Journeys' customers are always routed to the origin server that is closest to them ensuring the dynamic content on Great Rail Journeys' site loads as quickly as possible. Hepworth stated, \"Because all of the static content on the site gets cached, but the specific price or availability is determined at the time the customer visits, it's really crucial that Great Rail Journeys' customers are being routed to the closest origin servers to them so that content appears at the same time. That's why Geolocation steering was important for us.\"\n\nGreat Rail Journeys also uses Cloudflare's CDN and WAF to serve and secure their content around the world. Cloudflare's CDN, in conjunction with careful site design, helps Great Rail Journeys deliver 92% of their end user bandwidth from a Cloudflare Data Center, providing a faster end user experience.\n\nHepworth commented \"We've managed to globally achieve the same or better performance than our previous local CDN provider, we can use the WAF to protect our origin servers against attacks, and we have a suite of different tools for optimizing the site. We're now in a position with a more advanced network and website, with fewer potential points of failure.\"",

						"longDescription": "As Discord experiences explosive growth, they're thankful Cloudflare helps keep bandwidth & hardware costs down and web performance high.\n\n[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is a voice and text communication app for online computer gamers. Discord's goal is to become the de-facto standard communication app for PC gamers, and they've seen success, boasting 2.4 million concurrent users and over 25 million registrations as of July 2016.\n\n__Discord's Challenge: Mitigating DDoS Attacks on Websockets Servers at Scale__\n\nAs Discord prepared for rapid growth, they needed an affordable way to quickly scale their existing hardware infrastructure, while maintaining performance and security. Performance wise, Discord would need to transition from serving their content from a single homed server to a high performing CDN (Content Delivery Network) partner that could serve their static assets from all around the globe. Security wise, Discord needed to protect their websockets-based traffic from the rampant DDoS attacks that they were experiencing. As CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy explained, \"Since we are a gamer focused product we attract a lot of users who love to DDoS each other during game matches. As we grew more popular the intensity and occurrences of these DDoS attacks increased to the point where our engineers were constantly dealing with them.\" Vishnevskiy continued, \"Before Cloudflare, we were using a large number of HAProxy boxes with DNS load balancing to be able to failover during DDoS attacks on our real-time gateways.\" However, __their initial hardware solution could cost Discord up to six figures annually at scale and would still require work from Discord's engineers__. Discord thus needed an affordable, easily scalable [solution](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/) to stop these attacks or, according to Vishnevskiy, Discord's customer experience and retention would significantly drop: \"Every single outage would result in frustrated customers. While most existing customers were tolerant to the outages, new customers that signed up during the issues retained poorly due to very bad first impressions. Every time a customer got frustrated and lapsed, it pushed us further from our goal of becoming the de-facto communication app for gamers.\"\n\n__Discord's Solution: A CDN With Built-In Security__\n\nIn August 2015, Discord came to Cloudflare just as they hit 25,000 concurrent users, and Cloudflare provided immediate, lasting performance and security benefits. Discord easily scaled the business to their current 2.4 million concurrent users (over 9000% growth in just one year), by leveraging [Cloudflare's Content Distribution Network (CDN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cdn/). Cloudflare's CDN works by caching content to data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities, and then serving it directly to users from the nearest Data Center. Over 2 Pb of Discord's traffic per month is served directly from Cloudflare's edgeside cache to Discord's users. In turn, Discord, a Google Cloud customer, both provides customers with a snappier application through the high speed interconnections between Cloudflare and Google Cloud and __saves over $100,000 monthly__ on their Google Cloud bill. In addition, Discord gets tremendous comfort from knowing Cloudflare's security is always on protecting and serving their traffic. As Jake Heinz, a software engineer at Discord, explains \"We have Cloudflare sit in front of our websockets servers to absorb Layer 7 attacks and various layer 3 & 4 reflection attacks. We have 2.4 million concurrent users connected through Cloudflare to us, and Cloudflare quickly and securely serves our traffic even with spikes of websocket events up to 2 million/second.\"\n\nBy using Cloudflare Discord continually saves hundreds of thousands in hardware and bandwidth costs, while providing their users with higher performance and a more secure and reliable application.",

Technology for Solutions has a strong presence in the digital media segment of Latin America and constantly looks for opportunities to develop partnerships with leading technology companies that complement their business. This study highlights Technology for Solutions client Pasion Futbol, an internet hub for professional soccer fans around the world.\n\n__Technology for Solutions Challenge With Their Client Pasion Futbol: Mitigating Costs While Improving Performance__\n\nWith 9 million returning fans, [pasionfutbol.com](https://www.pasionfutbol.com/) sees over 80 million page views every month. A main concern for Pasion Futbol is affordably providing a high performing, accessible website to every soccer fan. Technology for Solutions was thus tasked with finding a way to reduce costs while improving performance for their client. \"We are always searching for constant optimization\" said Hernan Marsili from Technology for Solutions, \"Other providers have focused on distributing traffic from the USA to reduce costs, which can lead to a poor end user experience in Latin America. We also knew that a great deal of the traffic that was being paid for was coming from bots and other sites that were illegally scraping content and images from our client's website.\" In order to provide Pasion Futbol with the performance their users needed, Technology for Solutions was in the search for a CDN solution with a security focus and wide coverage in Latin America.\n\n__Solution: A Global, High-Performing Content Delivery Network (CDN)__\n\nTechnology for Solutions found Cloudflare through their research on internet security companies and decided to integrate it directly into their CMS publication ervices. This integration gives their clients access to Cloudflare's CDN and security suite directly from Technology for Solutions CMS.\n\nNow, Pasion Futbol uses Cloudflare's Global CDN (Content Delivery Network) to cache and serve their content from data centers in %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world. Five of these Data Centers are in South America, making Pasion Futbol's website faster and quicker to load for fans by serving content from locations closer to them. This performance boost reduced Pasion Futbol's bounce rate by over 5%, keeping users on their site longer.\n\nThe caching also helps Pasion Futbol save on bandwidth costs because requests are served directly from Cloudflare's edge without hitting Pasion Futbol's origin servers. Marsili explained __\"The benefits of utilizing Cloudflare were immediate. From a cost savings point of view we were able to reduce our bandwidth by over ⅓ and incremented offload by 20% which allowed us to reduce the number of servers in our infrastructure. Performance-wise, we were able to reduce the load times by more than 40% by migrating to HTTPS and HTTP/2 with Cloudflare.\"__ Plus, because Cloudflare is integrated into Technology for Solution's CMS, Pasion Futbol can specify exactly when to invalidate specific content, providing for larger TTLs for content, and thus enjoying even more bandwidth savings.\nCloudflare's internet security not only protects Pasion Futbol's website, but also contributes towards cost savings. By using Cloudflare's WAF (Web Application Firewall) Pasion Futbol was able to block bot traffic and illegal content scraping, preventing them from driving up bandwidth costs.",

Students from hundreds of different countries have gone through Udacity's programs, and some have been hired by top tech companies including Google, Amazon, and Facebook.\n\n__Udacity's Challenges: Tapping Into the Rapidly Growing Education Market in China__\n\nWith their goal of democratizing education, Udacity's strategy is to penetrate developing markets. China is thus a prime country for Udacity to target because of its deep cultural values of education. In addition to holding a public budget for education that has more than tripled in the last decade, China's private spending on education has also increased almost tenfold in the same time period. With this clear demand for private education in mind, Udacity launched its services in China earlier this year. Udacity's initial entry into the market, however, was met with frustration as customers had difficulty accessing Udacity's US-based content because of strict internet regulations by the government and slow internet connections throughout China. Paul Bauer, a platform & infrastructure engineer at Udacity, noted \"Depending on your ISP in China, loading the assets from our classroom would take several minutes; that's because AWS CloudFront nodes were getting throttled like everything else outside China to as little as 20 Kbps.\" Udacity was able to quickly respond and create a localized marketing site, but their classroom page, the portal through which students access Udacity's content was still based in the US through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Udacity knew they had to increase the performance of their classroom or lose customers.\n\n__Udacity's Solution: A CDN With a Global Integrated Network and Presence in Mainland China__\n\nTo solve this challenge, Udacity needed a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that had presence in mainland China that could locally cache their Javascript, CSS, and image assets so students could learn without interruption. Udacity chose Cloudflare, which offers a Global CDN network with data centers in %{ChinaDataCenterCount} cities across mainland China through a strategic partnership with Baidu. By leveraging these mainland China Data Centers, Cloudflare offers the only globally integrated CDN with a China presence, dramatically increasing web performance and security for Udacity and their visitors across China.\n\nBy using [Cloudflare's China CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/china/), Udacity has achieved a two order of magnitude performance improvement— __engineers in Udacity's Shanghai office saw asset load times that were as high as ten seconds drop to 500 milliseconds when they switched their site to Cloudflare.__\n\nBeyond a global, scalable network, Udacity required control. Through Page Rules, Udacity has fine-grained control over their use of Cloudflare's network and security services. Bauer remarked that \"internal testing with Page Rules has been super helpful. They allow us to easily and quickly troubleshoot problems with our site. Recently, we were able to quickly troubleshoot an SSL issue thanks to Page Rules.\"\n\nBauer's final remark: \"I couldn't be happier as an engineer to work with Cloudflare.\"",

Happn is a mobile dating app that offers a unique real time, real life, hyper located experience and interactions with people one have crossed paths with. It could be in the subway, a store, walking in the street, an elevator or a restaurant... or anywhere, just as real life.\n\nEvery time you cross paths with another Happn user, his or her profile appears on your timeline on the app. Currently present in more than 40 major cities around the world, from San Paulo to Singapore. The app has grown rapidly and attracted over 22 million users since its launch.\n\n__Happn's Challenge: Maintaining Performance & Keeping Customer Data Secure__\n\nHappn's rapid global expansion made it a visible target for cybercriminals. The company always made a priority to ensure the security of its customer data and, with 22 million users over the globe today, it wanted to further strengthen its security measures while maintaining the performance of its infrastructure to ensure the quality of the service provided to its users. These requirements encouraged Happn's to search for a trustworthy security partner. Lead Operations Engineer Marc Falzon said: \"Performance and security are equally top-of-mind at Happn. We needed protection against advanced DDoS attacks and a WAF that would enable us to effectively block more targeted attacks.\"\n\n__Enter Cloudflare__\n\nHappn decided on using Cloudflare's advanced DDoS mitigation and its powerful, customizable WAF to address their performance and security requirements.\n\n__Deep Dive: Advanced DDoS Mitigation__\n\nHappn is now automatically protected against level 3 and 4 DDoS attacks thanks to Cloudflare's advanced Anycast Network DDoS mitigation technology. Cloudflare's DDoS protection is best-of-breed and is well known for [stopping the largest DDoS attack in history](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-ddos-that-almost-broke-the-internet/). This protection works by recognizing threats and routing malicious traffic through Cloudflare's network where it is absorbed by data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities spread throughout the world instead of hitting and overwhelming an origin server. Happn is now protected from these attacks and their users enjoy snappy page load times and fast app performance.\n\n__Deep Dive: Web Application Firewall (WAF)__\n\nHappn also uses Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect their API against targeted application layer attacks. Cloudflare's WAF prevents hackers from ever reaching the Happn servers so there is no need for Happn to make any changes to their codebase. Cloudflare's out-of-the-box WAF rulesets help Happn prevent layer 7 attacks aimed at particular technologies, and above this, Happn created custom WAF rules jointly with the Cloudflare support team to protect against specific, unique threats. \"Ultimately\" Falzon said, \"we could better block and mitigate targeted attacks thanks to the WAF.\"\n\n__Unexpected Benefits: IPv6 Compatibility & DNS Analytics__\n\nHappn also enjoys the benefit of Cloudflare's IPv6 gateway, which ensures Happn is forward compatible with the network and app requirements of the future while maintaining their existing hardware ([as Apple start to transition to IPv6-only network services in iOS 9](https://blog.cloudflare.com/supporting-the-transition-to-ipv6-only-networking-services-for-ios/)). Plus, Happn uses Cloudflare's DNS Analytics to gain deeper insight into their DNS traffic. Falzon noted \"We were interested in this feature because I like visibility into critical competencies like DNS. We're very happy with Cloudflare's existing DNS service, and now we have deeper information about DNS request volume and geographies.\"",

Chocolatey has seen an amazing increase in the number of users and community over the past 5 years with a 400% increase in the number of downloads from 2014 to 2015.\n\n> Chocolatey's Rapid Growth\n![chocolatey-graphic](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/rhB1qy5ipMIk4oYueU06E/507d1c13d26ecaea0fe59ffc3fc8aa30/chocolatey-graphic.png)\n\n__Chocolatey's Challenge: Scaling to Meet the Demands of A Rapidly Growing Open Source Community__\n\nThough Chocolatey began as a small open source tool, the community has since exploded and as a result Chocolatey was downloaded over 50 million times just in the first half of 2016. To accommodate this rapid growth in demand Chocolatey needed to scale their infrastructure. Rob Reynolds, founder of Chocolatey, explained that \"We were looking for the ability to cache static content and provide a more reliable service without having to continue to overload our backend. It wasn't like we were being DDoS'd, we were receiving legitimate requests. We just needed bigger infrastructure. We needed something to support the sheer amount of traffic we were experiencing.\" The challenge for Chocolatey, though, was finding an affordable solution so that they could continue to offer their free services.\n\n__Chocolatey's Solution: An Affordable, Flat-Rate Content Delivery Network (CDN)__\n\nChocolatey's requirements could be perfectly matched by a CDN and they chose Cloudflare because of it's touted reputation and flat rate pricing. Chocolatey enjoys the lower request load and less expensive infrastructure costs because Cloudflare's CDN replicates Chocolatey's static content and serves it from data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities around the world. By serving cached content from Cloudflare's edge both Chocolatey's need for servers and their bandwidth costs are reduced by over 90% each month. Reynolds enjoys that \"The Cloudflare CDN helps us handle the massive number of requests we receive and helps cache packages so that our infrastructure costs are lower and more predictable.\"\n\nFurthermore, Chocolatey enjoys the fine-grained control they get with Page Rules. Reynolds delighted \"Page rules are huge for determining caching. We enjoy how much control they allow us, and how much we save by using them.\" Chocolatey also received added security benefits by using Cloudflare. \"We did come under a legitimate DDoS attack recently,\" explained Reynolds, \"As soon as we turned on I'm Under Attack Mode the site stayed up and the attack was mitigated.\"",

						"longDescription": "Quizlet receives performance and security benefits, while saving more than 50% on their Google Cloud networking egress bill by using Cloudflare.\n\nQuizlet makes study tools used by students and teachers. With more than 20 million monthly visitors, Quizlet has achieved success by enabling students to create and share study materials across on any subject.\n\n__Quizlet's Challenges: Mitigating DDoS Attacks and Globally Serving Content__\n\nQuizlet is the most popular online learning service in the United States, with a top 50 website and iOS and Android apps consistently ranked in the top 10 educational apps in their respective stores. As the site became more and more popular, it also became a bigger target for bad actors. Peter Bakkum, platform lead at Quizlet, recounted that \"as we grew and became a more visible target, we were starting to have trouble with DDoS attacks on our site preventing students from accessing study material.\" Furthermore, Quizlet was still serving traffic out of a single region in the US, which was limiting it's ability to quickly serve content to a global student base. In order to meet the goal of making its learning tools readily available to the world, Quizlet needed a way to both protect its website from the increase in DDoS attacks, while simultaneously distributing its content internationally with high performance.\n\n__Quizlet's Solution: A Multi-Spoked Problem With a Bundled, Cost-Effective Solution__\n\n![quizlet-savings-graph](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/24b8qyy4ggsMI8Mu4KuEGk/39754aa21141aef70076aaf4acf59d7f/quizlet-savings-graph.png)\n\nQuizlet found a solution to their problem that was easy, affordable, and effective. Quizlet enrolled in Cloudflare's CDN, DNS, WAF, and DDoS mitigation services and immediately noticed a dramatic improvement. Bakkum related that \"The reason we use Cloudflare is because the security features are excellent, the CDN is high performing, and using a single solution is very convenient. It simplifies everything and allows us to focus on our core business.\"\n\nWhile Quizlet focuses on their core business, Cloudflare helps to quickly and securely serve content around the world. Bakkum further explained \"We take connectivity in places with poor internet really seriously, so the latency benefits of Cloudflare are huge for us. Because we run out of a single region in the US we've seen dramatically increased performance for our international students because of Cloudflare's global caching.\" Furthermore, Quizlet sees security benefits that simultaneously protect its site and further increase its performance. This is possible because Quizlet's site now sits behind Cloudflare's network, which means malicious traffic is diverted away from hitting Quizlet's origin server by Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF), and DDoS attacks are mitigated through Cloudflare's advanced web security. In addition, Bakkum was delighted that \"our TLS traffic sees significant performance benefits because Cloudflare handles SSL negotiations edgeside closer to the user.\"\n\n![quizlet-performace](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7CEil4V160sQwueKS6gSaS/9a7a41a400b6f4e196eac05c824b3fe3/quizlet-performace.png)\n\nCloudflare not only helps Quizlet with security and content distribution, but also helps save them thousands of dollars on their monthly Google Cloud Services bill. In May 2016, the last month of school and a busy time for Quizlet, Cloudflare helped cut their network egress bill by more than 50%— which translated to thousands of dollars that Quizlet saves every month thanks to Cloudflare. On average, Quizlet saves over 10Tb of bandwidth every day.",

Its clients range from small individual users to large enterprise customers. Their goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to access email on any device.\n\n__FastMail's Challenge: Protecting DNS Infrastructure to Ensure That Email Always Gets Delivered__\n\nIn November of 2015 FastMail received a DDoS attack threat from hackers demanding a ransom in exchange for refraining from the attack. A DDoS attack on a mail provider, as FastMail explained [in their blog post about the event](https://blog.fastmail.com/2015/11/11/ddos-attack-may-lead-to-potential-service-disruption-this-week/), \"is like being unable to get to your post box because a huge crowd has formed around the front door of the post office.\" Maintaining their stance to refuse negotiations with any hacker group FastMail refused to deliver the ransom and took internal precautions to ensure their customers would still be able to access their mail in the event of an attack. Though FastMail's mitigation strategies largely worked for this attack, they were in search of a security partner that would give them peace of mind in the case of any future threats or attacks.\n\n__FastMail's Solution: A Reverse Proxy for DNS Infrastructure__\n\nFastMail decided that the best solution to their challenge was Cloudflare's DNS Firewall service. DNS Firewall is a service where FastMail uses Cloudflare's network as a reverse proxy for their DNS infrastructure. That is, traffic aimed at FastMail's DNS servers is first routed through one of Cloudflare's global Data Centers, where malicious requests are blocked and 100% clean traffic is then directed to FastMail's masked origin servers. This solution is perfect for FastMail because, as Rob Norris, Operations Manager at FastMail, \"As long as you have DNS you don't bounce mail, but when DNS goes down so does mail.\" DNS Firewall is thus especially helpful to FastMail because it means that their DNS is always on, and thus their mail will always get delivered. \"We work really hard on reliability\" said David Gurvich, marketing manager at FastMail, \"But with Cloudflare we get peace of mind. Even if we disappear off the network, Cloudflare is going to continue to serve edge DNS for us and thereby ensuring messages don't get lost.\"",

This social publishing platform allows over 60 million users to share their opinions, interests and experiences democratically and without censorship.\n\nSince Taringa!'s birth in 2004, the site experienced an exponential growth, with top markets in Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, and the US Hispanic community. As its user base continues to expand, Taringa! executives started looking for a way to ensure a fast and reliable online experience.\n\n__Expanding with Cloudflare's Global Network__\n\n\"We were looking for a performance and security company that was aggressively expanding their network in countries where most of our users live\", said Nicolás Cohen, CTO at Taringa!. With a global network of data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities, Cloudflare has a heavy presence in Spanish-speaking countries such as Argentina, Perú, Chile, Colombia, Spain, as well as the US.\n\n\"I read about Cloudflare in Ars Technica\", remembers Cohen, \"and I was particularly impressed when they thwarted the biggest DDoS attack in Internet history. If you add that to the amount of presence they have in Latin America, the choice was simple\".\n\nSince moving their application onto Cloudflare in 2015, Taringa! has made good use of Cloudflare's global caching to dramatically decrease load times and save over 80% on monthly bandwidth costs. \"We serve 500 TB of image traffic through Cloudflare every month to over 60 million users\", explains Juan Chimienti, Taringa!'s Head of Site Performance & Reliability. \"The vast majority of that traffic is served from their edge so it's fast and keeps the number of requests to our origin servers low.\"\n\nThe overall availability of the site improved not only on the good days but also on the bad ones. \"By using Cloudflare we are literally closer to our users, and this gives us the ability to see networking issues that were affecting even a small portion of our users and fix it\" says Juan.\n\nOne of Taringa!'s biggest concerns was the potential overhead they might incur for having one more hop between their users and the uncached data. However, Juan noted that \"we noticed that the network response time in Argentina was not affected at all and was actually improved in other parts of the continent.\"\n\nAnother benefit Taringa! experienced with Cloudflare's solution is how easy it is to implement encryption. This not only makes communication more secure, it also allows Taringa! to take advantage of all the performance features of HTTP/2 with no configuration on their end. \"Knowing that we can count on Cloudflare's scale with our customer growth allows us to think freely about solutions for problems that were previously unsolvable for us.\"",

Its flagship product, a web-based site builder, allows non-technical users to create a website and establish a digital presence for themselves or their small businesses through Yola's [ecommerce](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/) and marketing tools. Today, Yola has more than 10 million users and hosts 50 million pages across both dedicated and shared domains.\n\n__Yola's Challenges:__\n\nSimilar to Cloudflare, Yola shares the mission to make the web secure for all global visitors. With this mission, they started researching ways to offer Universal SSL to all of the web properties on their network. As a big proponent for for Web Security and Performance, they already had put in place DDoS protection, a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and managed DNS capabilities to deliver a world class service. When Yola started evaluating alternatives, a question came to mind; \"Could we roll out Universal SSL while at the same time consolidating multiple vendor contracts?\"\n\n__Enter Cloudflare:__\n\nCloudflare first made an impact in the evaluation process by showing the speed and ease of rolling out Universal SSL for all its customers. With that primary need in place, Yola began to evaluate Cloudflare for a wider range of services including DDoS protection, CDN, and DNS. Yola's detailed analysis showed that Cloudflare can effectively deliver on these feature areas as well. By consolidating vendors from three to one, Yola was able to cut costs and enhance their end users' website performance and efficiency.\n\n__Getting Started: The Integration Phase__\n\nThough Cloudflare offered the perfect single-vendor solution for Yola's multiple needs, there was still the challenge of migrating Yola's substantial user base to Cloudflare's platform. Lisa Retief, VP of Engineering at Yola, remarked that \"Cloudflare was very supportive during the onboarding process. It was not a simple one for us on the partner side, as we had millions of user sites that needed to be migrated. Any questions we had were promptly answered and appropriately escalated.\"\n\nMigrating Yola's users in a straightforward and scalable way was key to the project's success. Thanks to the ease of Cloudflare's host API, Yola had managed to move their user base to Cloudflare's platform within a few weeks.\n\n__Deep Dive: Benefits of SSL Security__\n\nAccording to Yola, one of the big selling points for Cloudflare was its Universal SSL service. Lisa Retief noted that a big problem Cloudflare solved \"was how to turn on SSL traffic to our users' websites. There were a few ways to solve the problem, but when Cloudflare launched their Universal SSL product it provided a simpler path to get there.\" Cloudflare's Universal SSL service is offered for free to every Cloudflare client because Cloudflare believes in encrypting as much web traffic as possible to prevent data theft and other site tampering.\n\n__Deep Dive: DDoS Protection__\n\nAll of Yola's sites are automatically protected against level 3 and 4 DDoS attacks thanks to Cloudflare's advanced Anycast Network DDoS mitigation technology. As a host that can have multiple websites on a single shared IP address, Yola has always provided their users with premium DDoS protection, because when one site is attacked, many users are potentially affected. Because of Cloudflare's state-of-the-art Anycast Network, these attacks are s ystematically and automatically protected for every one of Yola's sites. This has allowed Yola to discontinue service with their previous DDoS mitigator.\n\n__Deep Dive: Content Delivery Network (CDN)__\n\nYola now enjoys extremely fast content loading due to Cloudflare's global CDN. A key for Yola's ability to serve small business customers from all around the world is to bring website content close to local web surfers. By using Cloudflare's CDN, the page content from Yola's 10 million+ sites gets replicated to Cloudflare's data centers in over %{DataCenterCount} cities across the globe, [optimizing page load experiences](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) for site visitors from all around the world.\n\n__DNS__\n\nCloudflare operates one of the fastest DNS infrastructures in the world. Through Cloudflare's global, powerful, and secure DNS, Yola has seen improvements in users' page loading times, which in turn has improved overall customer satisfaction. Furthermore, because Yola has moved its sites behind Cloudflare's Proxy, every site uses Cloudflare's DNS and is thus protected at both the subdomain and root domain level.\n\n__Unexpected Benefit: Bandwidth Savings__\n\nWhat started out as an effort to roll out Universal SSL to all of its customers has expanded to a wide adoption of Cloudflare's features. One result of employing all of this functionality from the same vendor on the same network has been a reduction in bandwidth usage now that 40% of the requests to user sites is served from cache. This reduction resulted from the combination of Cloudflare's, SSL security, advanced DDoS protection, Global CDN, and DNS infrastructure.\n\n# __40%__\n### __OF REQUESTS TO USER SITES__\n### Directly served by Cloudflare's caching",

The company serves over 50,000 customers in Brazil and shows no signs of slowing down. Unlike other hosting providers, Hostnet Brazil focuses on tools based on open-source software and constantly looks for ways to develop solutions at an affordable cost for its clients. \"Our goal is to provide users with the most advanced technology, simplifying the way websites are created and popularizing cyber security,\" says Kauê Linden, Director of Marketing at Hostnet Brazil.\n\n# __51%__\n### __BANDWIDTH SAVINGS__\n### by utilizing Cloudflare's caching\n__Coming Together to Serve Customers__\n\nHostnet Brazil started using Cloudflare to provide a more resilient hosting environment in the face of increasingly sophisticated cyber security threats, ranging from excessive bot crawling to distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS). \"Cloudflare proved the best option for our business. We moved away from Amazon's CloudFront, to take advantage of Cloudflare's integrated performance and security solutions. This helped us protect our platform and make it future-proof,\" says Linden.\n\nMoreover, Hostnet's customers have access to Cloudflare's globally distributed network with data centers in %{DataCenterCount} cities. Five of them are in Latin America, including São Paulo, Brazil. As a result, Hostnet customers' sites benefit from 2x faster load times on average. For the ones that needed more sophisticated performance features, Hostnet implemented Railgun™, Cloudflare's dynamic content accelerator.\n\n__Managing Growth With Cloudflare__\n\n\"Cloudflare's Railgun is really unique and might be our favorite product, as it brings incredible geographical speed improvements, especially for our e-commerce customers\" says Linden.\n\nCloudflare powered sites on Hostnet Brazil enjoy 51% bandwidth savings, decreasing the monthly variable bandwidth bill of the client sites. To take full advantage of these [performance](https://www.cloudflare.com/solutions/ecommerce/optimization/) and security benefits, Hostnet utilizes a Cloudflare \"default on\" mode, which enables Cloudflare across all domains automatically.\n\n__Analytics__\n\n\"The partnership with Cloudflare represents a significant gain in performance and security for our customers. We are really proud to be among the first web hosts in Brazil to provide Cloudflare CDN & security to customers of all sizes,\" says Linden.\n\nLinden adds that when a Hostnet client opens an account their content is automatically replicated on the Cloudflare network, improving page load times, security, and search engine (SEO) results.",

						"longDescription": "Eurovision was taken down with DDoS. Cloudflare brought it back online. \n\nHeld every year since 1956, the [Eurovision Song Contest](http://www.eurovision.tv/) reached 170 million television viewers worldwide in 2013. Participants from about 40 countries perform an original song, and a combination of public vote and national juries decide who continues on from the semi-finals to the Grand Final. Past winners of Eurovision include Celine Dion, the best-selling Canadian artist of all time, and ABBA, the most successful group to ever to take part in the contest. The contest takes place throughout the year with the semi-finals and final lasting for just a week, making for an incredibly exciting and intense grand final event.\n\n__Eurovision Sends Cloudflare an SOS__\n\nDuring the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest semi final, the busiest time of year for the website, Eurovision.tv was targeted with a large DDoS attack. \"Our content delivery network provider at that time could only do very little to mitigate the attack, and because we were using a CDN, our hosting partner couldn't do much filtering either,\" said Wouter van Vliet, Project Developer of the Eurovision Song Contest at EBU/EUROVISION. \"The first flood of attack traffic was mitigated with some blocking techniques implemented by our CDN, but when the attack got more creative there was nothing more they could do.\"\n\nWouter and his team came across Cloudflare a few months earlier and had decided to keep the service in mind in case they were in need of additional security and protection. That time came sooner than they had imagined. With the main site of Europe's favorite TV show going down during the most critical time of the year, just days before the Grand Final, they decided they needed Cloudflare. And fast!\n\nDuring the first semi final, fans of the Eurovision Song Contest access the website to find out results and to watch online streams of the contest. With the site service disrupting, visitors from around the world to Eurovision.tv experienced difficulty accessing these results and streams. It was imperative to the Eurovision Song Contest that they get back up and running.\n\nSo the Eurovision Song Contest reached out to Cloudflare. Cloudflare mitigated the DDoS attack and the site was brought back online. The editorial team and Eurovision.tv's visitors immediately noticed the site was back in business. \"We also noticed that the servers were beginning to have some space to breath again as well,\" said van Vliet. \"We have thrived from that moment on. Cloudflare has made our platforms much more stable, which has been a huge value for us.\"\n\n__Cloudflare Answers, Provides More Than Just Search and Rescue__\n\nCloudflare not only mitigated the DDoS attack, but also increased Eurovision.tv's performance, providing a noticeable improvement in load time to everyone who visits the site. With security and performance taken care of, the Eurovision Song Contest was able to get rid of their old CDN service and rely entirely on Cloudflare.\n\nAs the Eurovision Song Contest used the service more, they discovered additional features that made their lives easier. Eurovision.tv used Page Rules to cache additional content on Cloudflare's edge, speeding up delivery without sacrificing up-to-the-minute updates during the global event. Page Rules gives Cloudflare customers fine-grained control over how Cloudflare interacts with a site on a page-by-page basis.\n\n\"The combination of attack mitigation and CDN is what makes it so powerful,\" said van Vliet. \"Thanks to the great support we received from the Cloudflare team, especially during our peak weeks in May, we've felt more secure that the sites would keep running smooth regardless of amounts of traffic - and they have.\"",

In 2013, however, the Bay Bridge is getting its moment in the spotlight thanks to [Words Pictures Ideas](http://wordspicturesideas.com/).\n\nWords Pictures Ideas works with brands and organizations in need of smarter communications. While thinking of ways to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Bay Bridge, WPI founder Ben Davis came up with the idea to turn the West Span of the bridge into a canvas for light art.\n\n__Business challenge__\n\nThe Bay Lights were officially unveiled on March 5, 2013. Brian VanderZanden, Lead Developer at WPI, knew there would be a surge in traffic to TheBayLights.org leading up to that day, and most likely a huge surge in traffic on the day of the unveiling. WPI has many sites on Cloudflare, including TheBayLights.org. He reached out to Cloudflare to make sure the site was ready to handle the increase in traffic.\n\nCloudflare suggested a few small optimizations (minification, an image that wasn't proxied because on a \"grey cloud\" DNS record), one useful reminder (allowlist the Cloudflare IPs), and a powerful recommendation: Cache Everything.\n\nBy default, Cloudflare will cache obviously static assets, but pass dynamic HTML through to the customer's webserver. For heavy load, on content that is not changing rapidly, full HTML pages -- or the entire site -- can be delivered from Cloudflare's global network, preserving the customer's webserver, database and other infrastructure. (Note: combined with single file purge, Cloudflare can serve as the global network for delivering a static site even with rapid changes, much as the Obama 2012 web team did.)\n\n# __100%__\n### __IMPROVEMENT IN RESOURCE UTILIZATION__\n### by utilizing Cloudflare's caching\n__Cloudflare's impact__\n\nOn the day of the unveiling, with Cache Everything turned on, TheBayLights.org saw traffic increase with a decrease on their system's resource utilization. By mid-day, a rush in traffic caused more load than the event's peak at 8:00 pm. The graph below shows an interesting resource demand for the site pre/post cache everything:\n\nThe site saw the largest influx of traffic between 8:00-9:00 pm, but the average I/O during that hour was under 2Mb/s. By midnight traffic was back down to only 2X of baseline traffic levels.\n\n\"We began to celebrate at 9:15 pm as we were confident that the peak in site traffic had been reached and there were no issues,\" said Brian. \"We are thrilled with the guidance and help Cloudflare offered in keeping us online during our biggest moment of the year, as well as the day to day performance and security they provide for all of our sites.\"\n\nThe Bay Lights will continue to shine for the next two years, creating yet another tourist stop in San Francisco. At Cloudflare, we are excited to be a part of the experience and look forward to helping keep TheBayLights.org shining online.\n",

						"shortDescription": "The San Francisco Marathon had a problem keeping their website up during race weekends.  Cloudflare kept the site up and running.",
						"longDescription": "The San Francisco Marathon is a popular race. With 24,000 runners competing in 5 events, the San Francisco Marathon has runners of all ages, from all over the globe. The website is used for registration, to organize runners during the actual event weekend and to track each runners race time.\n\n__The Results__\n\n\"During race weekend, we get a 400% increase to the traffic to our website. Last year, our servers failed due to the heavy traffic, leaving our racers disgruntled,\" said Laura Baalman, an independent IT consultant to the San Francisco Marathon website. \"This year, we wanted to optimize for heavy load. Getting on a CDN was one of the steps most heavily recommended to us.\"\n\n# __50%__\n### __REDUCTION IN SERVER REQUESTS__\n### by utilizing Cloudflare's technology\n\n__Cloudflare's impact__\n\n\"We signed up for the Cloudflare Business plan, and saw improvements in site performance immediately,\" said Baalman. \"Using third party tools like Pingdom, webpagetest.org and loadimpact.com, I was able to see our page load decrease by over 2 seconds.\"\n\nThe San Francisco Marathon website has many images and on race weekend, many of its visitors come over mobile devices. To get the best in image performance and mobile optimization, Laura turned on Polish and Mirage. \"Turning on Polish and Mirage cut our page loads and page size in half on our most image-heavy page—our homepage,\" said Baalman.\n\nNow with a website that loaded twice as fast as before, Laura and the San Francisco Marathon Team turned their attention to race weekend. \"Having Cloudflare on our website, gave us that extra confidence over race weekend,\" said Baalman. \"It meant us having to worry about one less thing. Our server was able to handle the heavy load of race weekend with absolutely no problem.\"\n\nThe San Francisco Marathon made it through race week and weekend with snappy page loads, no downtime and an overall better experience for their customers during their busiest week of the year.\n\n\"I really love how simple it was to set up and use. Cloudflare is an easy to use CDN service with offerings at all levels,\" said Laura. \"I would recommend anyone with a website, especially those that get big changes in traffic, to give it a try.",
