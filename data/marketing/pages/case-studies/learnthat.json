				"longDescription": "[LearnThat.org](http://www.learnthat.org/) is a website that delivers customized vocabulary and spelling tutoring based on a proprietary database of about 180,000 words. LearnThat.org is supported by the nonprofit organization, LearnThat Foundation.\n\n__Business challenge__\n\nWe were struggling with keeping our visitors on our site. While we were successful at sending traffic to our site, the amount of time visitors spent on our site was low. I had heard about Cloudflare at a local meetup. I knew we needed additional performance for the site, so I decided to sign up.\n\n# __3X__\n### __PAGE VIEWS HANDLED__\n### by utilizing Cloudflare's cookie-based key caching\n\n__Cloudflare's impact__\n\nOnce we signed up for Cloudflare, the service automatically started to cache static content from our site all over the world. We didn't have to configure anything, which was important, since we didn't have the technical resources to do so.\n\nThe benefit of Cloudflare was immediate. Our website started to load much faster all over the world and our visitors noticed. We saw a drastic jump in page views. People viewed three times more pages on our site. At the same time, the bounce rate (the number of people who leave the site on the first page) dropped to less than a third.\n\nOverall, the number of visitors more than doubled. I was delighted! It's rare to see such a drastic improvement so quickly.\n\nNow that my site is fast and snappy, I can spend time interacting with our visitors and focus on our business. My visitors engage with each other, spend more time reading on the website and no longer leave frustrated by slow load times. Many thanks to Cloudflare for making an outstanding service available and affordable to small organizations like ourselves!",
