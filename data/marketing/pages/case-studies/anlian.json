				"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare Magic Transit defends ANLIAN against network layer attacks while enhancing site performance__\n\nANLIAN Network, a global cloud computing company based in Hong Kong, provides customers with comprehensive cloud services, including public, private, hybrid, and proprietary clouds. ANLIAN is committed to creating a safe, fast, and reliable security solution for their customers who operate globally. \n\n### __Challenge: Lacking security resources to defend global customers against large-scale cyber attacks__\n\nAs a cloud security solutions provider, ANLIAN's business growth was limited due to their inability to fully extend their security capabilities worldwide. Ongoing DDoS attacks affected network performance, resulting in poor user experience, and ultimately lost customers for ANLIAN. Before starting their engagement with Cloudflare, ANLIAN had worked with other vendors, but they were still not seeing the results they had hoped for. ANLIAN needed a partner who would work with them to expand their security resources as they and their customers continued to expand across the globe. \n\n### __Solution: Protecting customers from countless attacks with Magic Transit__\n\nIn 2020, ANLIAN began working with Cloudflare, and started using their Network Services offering - Magic Transit. With the help of Cloudflare Magic Transit, ANLIAN is now able to provide a complete solution for their gaming, live broadcast, and ecommerce customers by enabling them to route their traffic through Cloudflare's global network. Not long after starting to use Cloudflare, ANLIAN saw they were able to block attacks, increase network performance, and improve their customer retention. \n\nMagic Transit delivers DDoS protection, traffic acceleration and many other capabilities for on-premise, cloud-hosted and hybrid networks from every Cloudflare data center across the world. Magic Transit helps ANLIAN's customers protect their entire IP subnets from DDoS attacks, while also accelerating network traffic. The global Cloudflare network enhances ANLIAN's existing products while also enabling them to expand their product offerings. \n\nGuo Haijun, Chief Security Officer at ANLIAN said, \"With Cloudflare Magic Transit, we were able to defend our customers against countless attacks every week and improve page load times simultaneously. It is really the best case scenario for us and our customers.\"\n\nHaijun also noted that working with Cloudflare has improved ANLIAN's reputation as a security provider, and they are able to more successfully retain customers who operate globally. \n\nANLIAN also appreciates the support they receive from the Cloudflare team. Hijun adds, \"The Cloudflare team is very responsive, knowledgeable, and they meet our needs at all levels. We really enjoy working with them.\" \n\nIn addition to Magic Transit, ANLIAN is currently evaluating Cloudflare's edge computing products. ANLIAN looks forward to a long-term partnership with Cloudflare as they continue to provide a one-stop solution for their growing clientele. \n",
