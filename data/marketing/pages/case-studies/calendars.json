				"longDescription": "Cloudflare helps [Calendars.com](http://www.calendars.com/) meet high expectations of its e-commerce customers when it comes to website speed and security.\n\n__The Challenge__\n\nNumerous top-tier web properties rely on Spark::red to keep their e-commerce sites online and transacting at full speed. Any downtime or slowness results in negative user experience, impacting the site's e-commerce conversion rate and revenue.\n\nSpark::red understands the high expectations of its e-commerce customers when it comes to website speed and security. \"Performance and security features are absolutely critical for online businesses. Sites need to load fast, and customers need to know that their personal information (emails, passwords, credit card numbers, etc.) is protected\", said Devon Hillard, Spark::red co-founder.\n\n__The Partnership__\n\nBy partnering with Cloudflare, Spark::red brings premium performance and security to its customers. By leveraging the speed and security of the Cloudflare technology, Spark::red's customers enjoy faster content delivery, seamless performance on mobile, advanced security protection, and optimized front/back-end. This ultimately translates into better user experience, which positively impacts the business' bottom line.\n\n__The Results__\n\nA shining example of Cloudflare's impact on Spark::red's clients is Calendars.comâ€”an Internet top 500 retailer. In the past, Calendars.com suffered from multiple site outages due to traffic spikes on Black Fridays and Cyber Mondays as well as during other peak periods. \"We regularly struggled with site stability issues and were always nervous as we approached our peak transaction period around the Black Friday weekend\", says Paul Hoffman, Calendars.com COO.\n\nIn 2013, backed by Spark::red and Cloudflare, Calendars.com sustained a 100% uptime, experienced zero security issues, and delivered fast page load times to its site's visitors. Calendars.com successfully managed a record increase in site traffic during the 2013 holiday season, which resulted in record-breaking online sales on Cyber Monday.",
