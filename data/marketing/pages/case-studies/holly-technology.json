				"shortDescription": "Holly Technology uses Cloudflare application services solutions to solve network congestion and security problems",
				"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare helps Holly Technology optimize security and performance across Southeast Asia__\n\nGuided by their \"go global\" strategy, Holly Technology was established in Hong Kong in 2017. The company provides network and cloud architecture solution services as well as IDC and cloud computing services for a wide customer base in Asia. In addition to providing hosting services and cloud computing architecture, they help customers build their own global networks. \n\n### __Challenge: Network congestion impedes dynamic content delivery to users in Southeast Asia__\n\nThe majority of Holly Tech's customer base is concentrated in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and many of them run online gaming platforms. For these customers, reaching an online user base - one that spans many countries around the world - can be challenging. Network congestion and latency often impacts the speed at which content is delivered to the users, which would cause game lags and ultimately drive players to seek out alternative platforms.  To remedy this issue and prevent it from happening in the future, Holly Tech began the search for a partnership that would solve these problems and allow them to better serve their customers. \n\n### __Cloudflare's global network improves speed and reliability for customers around the world__\n\nAfter searching for a vendor that could not only help solve their latency issues, but also tailor efficient and budget friendly services for their customers, Holly Tech decided on Cloudflare's application services solutions. \n\nWith Cloudflare's global cloud network, Holly Tech's customers were able to create automated workflows, fine-tune control over content caching and purchasing, and determine congestion in real time in order to route network traffic through the fastest and most reliable network path. Now, Holly Tech's customers don't have to worry about traffic spikes or network congestion slowing down their sites, helping improve their reputation and relationship with online users.\n\n\"The difference before and after using Cloudflare was like night and day. Their global network provided our customers with relief and the chance to give their users a more enjoyable gaming experience,\" said Jessie Chen, Holly Technology's Product and Service Manager. \n\n### __Cloudflare application security tools block billions of attacks__\n\nIn addition to optimizing site performance, Cloudflare helps Holly Tech safeguard their customers with integrated security tools, including Advanced DDoS Protection, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Rate Limiting. \n\nWith online threats becoming an increasingly prevalent issue, Cloudflare detects and blocks more than 20 billion malicious attacks for Holly Tech's customers each month. Now DDoS attacks, malicious bots, and other threats are no longer a concern. Holly Tech's staff is now able to spend less time on mitigating attacks, and more time on product development. \n\nThe combination of Cloudflare's application performance and security tools greatly enhanced the service Holly Tech is able to provide its customers, and they look forward to a long continued partnership. \n\n\"Cloudflare has delivered our customers in Hong Kong and Taiwan the high-speed and secure experience their users in Southeast Asia were previously lacking. One of the best things about Cloudflare is that it allows us to raise the bar when it comes to customer experience,\" says Chen. \n",
