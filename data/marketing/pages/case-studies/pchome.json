				"longDescription": "## __Cloudflare performance solutions improve the user experience for PChome__\n\nPChome was established in 1996 as a Taiwanese web portal. PChome Online Inc. was officially incorporated in July 1998, and went public in January 2005, becoming the first internet company to be listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (symbol 8044). PChome is now the leading integrated e-commerce service group in Taiwan, providing e-commerce, FinTech, warehousing, logistics, and fulfillment service.\n\n### __Challenge: Self-built CDN solution cannot support the surge in traffic volume during promotional periods__\n\nPreviously, PChome relied on a homegrown content delivery network (CDN). Unfortunately, this solution had limited capacity and could not support heavy traffic volumes. This was particularly noticeable with push advertisements during promotions when images would load slowly. For some time, PChome assumed it was normal for images to load slowly when there were too many visitors on the site. They wanted to improve the customer experience, so they began to look for an external vendor. \n\n### __Solution: Cloudflare’s global network solves image buffering delays and simplifies the complexity of independent operations__\n\nIn the end, PChome decided to adopt the Cloudflare global network. After making the switch, PChome found that their push advertisements no longer suffered from buffering. In fact, the entire website now loads smoothly no matter how much traffic spikes during promotional periods, greatly improving the user experience.  This time is very valuable when it comes to customer retention. \n\nIn addition to being highly satisfied with the results, PChome also appreciates how intuitive and easy it is to use. Chen Tsan-Yuan, PChome Online Inc. Assistant Vice President , says, \"Not only do Cloudflare solutions provide noticeable speed improvements, they also have a very user-friendly interface.”\n\nPChome also appreciates the support they receive from the Cloudflare team. When PChome encounters issues, the Cloudflare team responds extremely quickly and solves problems rapidly. Chen Tsan-Yuan added, \"From evaluating the product and throughout the entire usage process, communication between us and the Cloudflare team was very smooth. They respond quickly and are highly knowledgeable.\"",
