				"longDescription": "Cloudflare accelerates SplitmediaLabs' performance with its CDN and secures their servers from DDoS and injection attacks with its WAF, Rate Limiting and TLS.\n\n__About SplitmediaLabs:__\n\n[SplitmediaLabs](https://www.splitmedialabs.com/) is based in Hong Kong and builds tools for live streaming and recording applications for content creators, players, eSports and more\n\nMore than 8 Million people and businesses use SplitmediaLabs products to grow their communities, create innovative content and connect with other players from around the world. Based in Hong Kong and with a development center in Manila, Philippines, SplitmediaLabs has helped usher in the new age of live streaming gameplay since its creation back in 2009.\n\n__SplitmediaLabs challenge:__\n\nKeeping costs in check while meeting performance requirements, bandwidth savings and guarding against DDoS, XSS and injection attacks.\n\nFrequent attacks on XSplit - a live streaming and recording platform- led SplitmediaLabs to search for a WAF that could detect and react to attacks quickly.\n\n\"When XSplit was first attacked we fiddled around with ModSecurity and tested StackPath but didn't quite get the results we were looking for\" explains Michael Bachmann, CIO and Director of SplitmediaLabs. \"Keeping cost in check was a huge challenge. GCP and AWS are great platforms but the ease of adding new resources can lead to unforeseen costs and exposures, especially on development projects. \"\n\n__SplitmediaLabs' Solution:__\n\nPerformance Improvements with CDN and Fast DNS while protecting servers from DDoS, and using the WAF and rate limiting on logins, registering and expensive endpoints.\n\nSplitmedia's research led them to conclude that Cloudflare was the most flexible and feature rich offering for their use case and offered the most transparent pricing. \"We first started using Cloudflare as DNS for private domains and eventually migrated the company DNS from a well known provider to Cloudflare on a business plan.We found Cloudflare's DNS extremely fast and the overall solution was so easy to use and effective that we decided to scale to the enterprise plan.\"\n\nSplitmediaLabs leverages Cloudflare's global network of data centers in %{DataCenterCount} cities to ensure blazing fast performance. It uses Cloudflare's web application firewall to prevent from common attacks such as SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS) as well as Cloudflare's one-click SSL to secure connections and keep their customer data safe from monitoring and tampering.\n\n\"Keeping up with new technologies while keeping everything secure and fast is a constant challenge\" says Mak Sok, VP of Engineering of SplitmediaLabs. \"With Cloudflare, sleeping is easier when you know you have world class DDOS protection, TLS encryption and rate limiting.\"",
