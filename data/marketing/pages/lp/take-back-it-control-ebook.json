As business requirements changed, customer bases became global, and remote work took root, these technology teams were handed responsibility across more domains: cloud deployments, SaaS applications, and the public Internet. This greatly complicates  crucial tasks like managing employee access, setting global security policies, and monitoring and improving network performance. A connectivity cloud can help organizations deliver a unified experience for your customers, workforce, and developers amidst a vastly complex, distributed compute, storage and application environment.\n \n\n",

Its technology automates accounting, payroll and payment practices. \n\nSupporting millions of businesses across 21 countries, Sage helps SMBs thrive in a complex digital landscape. The Sage ecosystem allows entrepreneurs to offload their administrative processes and free up time and resources to focus on core business objectives. Sage's purpose is to knock down barriers so everyone can thrive and good security built into the products from the outset is the foundation of this. \n\n### __Challenge: Securing business application access to millions of users__\n\nAs providers of cloud-based financial and business management tools, Sage is responsible for the security of their clients' financial information. It is a charge they take seriously, especially as online threats become more sophisticated and automated threats increase in frequency.\n\n\"A key cybersecurity focus is the rise of criminal groups that try to hold companies to ransom by making data unavailable or simply by profiting from stolen data,\" says Sage  Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Gustavo Zeidan. \"Our challenge is to protect our customers' data, as well as their own customers' data, by staying ahead in technology evolution and anticipating changes in the threat landscape â€” always monitoring the environment and ensuring that Sage and our customers' data stay secure.\"\n\nAs Sage's product portfolio grew, so did their need to secure and integrate their new offerings without hindering development efforts or user access to financial tools and information. \n\n\"We are constantly evolving our business processes and technology, and a significant part of that initiative involved a strong push towards a Zero Trust network architecture,\" Zeidan explains. \"We have been consistently and relentlessly decommissioning legacy ways of working and old technologies such as VPN and modernising how our business colleagues and development teams use technology to deliver their work.\" \n\nLooking for a like-minded partner dedicated to innovation, Sage chose Cloudflare to help them achieve their security and development goals.   \n\n### __Solution: Mitigating automated threats and reducing network complexity with Cloudflare integrated security and analysis tools__\n\nUsing Cloudflare, Sage was able to reduce maintenance costs and streamline their digital footprint.\n\n\"The amount of insight we gained from Cloudflare's integrated solutions such as DNS Analytics is impressive,\" says Zeidan. \"With that added visibility, we could build an understanding of our footprint at the host level and make data driven business decisions on what to keep and what to decommission, enabling us to greatly simplify our external presence.\"  \n\nSage initially had adopted the core Cloudflare application services like the Web Application Firewall (WAF) and global Content Delivery Network (CDN) to bolster product performance and secure their websites and APIs. Based on their early successes, Sage began onboarding additional Cloudflare tools â€” like Bot Management and DDoS mitigation â€” to proactively defend against threats using behavioral analysis, fingerprinting, and machine learning to monitor traffic.\n\n\"Cloudflare gives us the ability to identify what is human and what is automated traffic,\" says Zeidan. \"That helps protect our websites from automated attacks and filter out traffic when they are attempting to use our platform in a different way it was designed for.\"\n\n### __Simplifying application security and development with Cloudflare Workers__\n\nWith its comprehensive set of enterprise management tools, ensuring effortless access while maintaining stringent application security and protecting data for a user base of millions was critical to Sage's success. \n\nToday, the Cloudflare-Sage partnership extends beyond security â€” the Cloudflare Workers development platform gives Sage DevOps an environment in which they can innovate and safely test and deploy additional layers of code straight from the network edge.\n\n\"Cloudflare Workers has brought immense flexibility to our engineering teams,\" says Zeidan. \"This solution alone enabled operations teams to provide fast response to various architecture challenges without having to go anywhere near application code or making changes to core infrastructure.\" \n\nSage's and Cloudflare share a focus on innovation and creating solutions that bring clear benefits to their end users.\n\n\"Sage has the ambition to knock down barriers and transform the way people think and work, enabling their organisations to thrive.\" \n",

								"longDescription": "## __Genuine Parts Company teams up with Cloudflare to create a cohesive security posture across its global ecommerce footprint of 900+ sites__\n\nSince its inception in 1928, Genuine Parts Company has sold a wide variety of  automotive replacement parts, industrial parts, and related supplies to a diverse customer base of individuals and businesses.The company's high-profile brands include NAPA AUTO PARTS, Traction Heavy Duty Parts, Motion NA, and Motion Asia Pacific.\n\nA Fortune 200 company, Genuine Parts Company employs more than 53,000 people worldwide and markets its products both online and through brick-and-mortar stores. Online sales are an increasingly important channel, and the company operates more than 900 [ecommerce websites](https://www.cloudflare.com/ecommerce/). \n\n### __Challenge: Gain better visibility into the attack surface__\n\nAccording to Damian Apone, global director of governance, risk, compliance, and security at Genuine Parts Company, the company's primary security challenges revolved around effective attack surface management. The team couldn't tell how many bot attacks and DDoS attacks were occurring globally. In addition, there was no visibility into how many attacks were prevented. \n\nThe company had a web application security service, but it did not deliver the level of insight Genuine Parts Company needed. In addition, the security service ran in multiple regionally siloed instances, making it difficult to manage centrally. \n\n\"We were paying a lot of money, but we had no visibility into our global digital footprint,\" Apone explains. \"We didn't have any information on how or when we were being attacked and we had no idea who was targeting us.\"\n\n### __The solution: Cloudflare delivers robust security with broad, deep visibility__\n\nThe security team opted to move to Cloudflare not only because of its exceptional protection for websites and applications, but also because Cloudflare provides a comprehensive view of attacks. With Cloudflare's Bot Management, DDoS mitigation, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Rate Limiting, the security team now has the visibility they need to achieve robust surface attack management. \n\nCloudflare's Security Center console depicts Genuine Parts Company's attack surface visually to help the team understand attack types, associated vulnerabilities, and risk levels. This visibility enables team members to quickly see which attacks represent a serious threat so they can marshal their defensive resources in the most effective and efficient manner. \n\nToday, Cloudflare protects 900+ Genuine Parts Company websites around the world. \n\n\"Our busiest website gets approximately 2.5 billion requests a month,\" Apone explains. \"It's hit by approximately 57 million threats each and every month. And Cloudflare blocks all 57 million every month. I know this because Cloudflare's security insights technology shows me exactly what's happening across the entire digital footprint.\"\n\nApone adds that senior leaders constantly scrutinize expenditures and want proof that the company gets adequate return on every investment. Cloudflare delivers value by providing details on the volume and type of attacks it defends against. \n\n\"It's exceptionally powerful to walk into the boardroom and say, 'these are the attacks we're experiencing, here's where they are coming from, and this is how we're blocking them,'\" Apone says. \"It resonates across the business when we say Cloudflare thwarted 450 million threats in one year. Each and every one of them could have had serious financial repercussions. When board members see the numbers, they know we're getting a solid return on our Cloudflare investment.\"\n\n### __Security insights in action__\n\nThe Cloudflare Security Center is the source for data on each attack along with insight into the business impact. For example, using the security insights technology, the security team identified the top five IP addresses hitting the company's most heavily trafficked ecommerce website. Investigation showed that the second most active IP address transacting on the site was a competitor. And that competitor was engaging in extensive screen scraping of the online catalog and accessing private company information.\n\n\"If we didn't have Cloudflare, we wouldn't have known this was happening and the behavior would have continued,\" Apone recalls. \"Malicious activity like this could affect company revenue. So Cloudflare allows us to not only protect the security of our websites, but also take steps to prevent this competitor from obtaining any additional private company information. It's not just security, it's also resiliency from a revenue perspective.\"\n\n### __Alignment with strategic policies__\n\nVendor consolidation is an important aspect of Genuine Parts Company's security strategy. Working with a patchwork of different providers makes it difficult to maintain a coordinated and collaborative security posture across areas of the business. So the security team focuses on partnering with providers that deliver services across a range of security requirements. Apone maintains that reducing the number of providers  enables the security team to orchestrate efforts from a single place, which increases efficiency and productivity. \n\nCloudflare's ability to handle a broad range of threats and provide broad and deep visibility into all of them aligns with Genuine Parts Company's strategic goals for vendor consolidation.\n\n### __Advantages of a true partnership__\n\nApone notes that the most beneficial aspect of switching to Cloudflare is the partnership that has developed. \"I don't need services, I don't need software, I need help solving problems,\" he says. \"Cloudflare embraces and approaches everything through the lens of what's best for the customer, always putting the customer first.\" \n\nThat customer-first attitude has made Cloudflare a trusted partner for Genuine Parts Company. \"Cloudflare is truly interested in solving our problems. The Cloudflare team has been at our side from the beginning. Regardless of the time of day or night, they've rolled up their sleeves and helped us overcome every issue we've experienced. That's where Cloudflare excels.\"\n",

								"longDescription": "## __Polestar drives Chinese consumer confidence and scores a Super Bowl win with Cloudflare__\n\nPolestar has always focused on performance and innovation. From its roots as an automotive racing team, the organization evolved to become Volvo's performance tuning arm. Under the Volvo brand, the Polestar badge became synonymous with the Swedish manufacturer's more sporty offerings. \n\nToday, as an independent electric car manufacturer, Polestar applies its talent toward the development and manufacture of design-forward, performance-oriented luxury electric vehicles (EVs). The company's ethosâ€” Pure Progressive Performance â€” is at the heart of its approach to all aspects of the business, from the cars it designs to the end-to-end customer experience it provides.\n\n### __The Challenge: Improving Chinese customer confidence, finding a strategic development partner, and ensuring highly-performant content delivery__\n\nFor automobile manufacturers, an effective digital infrastructure is central to both product performance and how customers perceive and interact with the manufacturer. Within the performance EV sector, Polestar has the mechanical pedigree, but wants to take its digital experience to the next level.   \n\n\"Polestar has a unique take on how to buy a car and it's very important to us to deliver on those expectations,\" explains Mikael Vesavuori, Cloud Software Architect and Technical Standards Lead at Polestar. \"Whether you purchase our cars online or visit one of the Polestar spaces, we tie together the physical and digital dimensions to provide a much richer retail and automotive encounter.\"\n\nOne way they achieve this is the Polestar Configurator, a central feature of Polestar's distinctive physical spaces. It is a media-rich digital and physical touchpoint that familiarizes buyers with vehicle configurations, options, and interior and exterior materials and trim. \n\nUnfortunately, the Polestar Configurator experienced performance and availability issues in China â€” a lucrative market where one in every five cars sold is an EV (1).\n\nAt the heart of the problem was Polestar's CDN provider, which had issues with the restrictive Chinese Internet infrastructure and connectivity problems with its global AWS network. The only solution was a partner that could overcome the latency, congestion and peering, and DNS issues that negatively affected customer perceptions of Polestar technology and the cars themselves.         \n\nIn addition to solving these issues, Polestar wanted a strategic partnership to aid along its software development roadmap. The company was developing a micro-front end architecture for its web presence that relied on multiple applications. These applications needed to interact seamlessly to provide a user experience that aligned with Polestar's brand objectives. \n\n\"We were looking for a proactive partner with developer experience, but we were sitting in meetings with vendors simply handing us documentation and saying, 'Here's how you can deal with the challenges you are facing,'\" says Johan Larsson, Technical Lead for the Polestar Platform Team.    \n\nFinally, as Polestar scaled its online and physical spaces internationally and began more proactively marketing its products, they wanted enterprise-class security and content delivery to ensure they remained performant in every imaginable scenario and market.\n\n### __The Cloudflare China Network provides world-class performance and reliability__\n\n\"It was a matter of perfect timing in a very poor situation,\" says Vesavuori, explaining Polestar's move to Cloudflare. With the current CDN partnership up for contract renewal and Chinese connectivity lagging, Polestar began researching to find the ideal solution partner. \n\n\"The list went from many names to very few,\" he explains. \"Only Cloudflare ticked all the boxes and met all of our absolute requirements for a dedicated China network â€” brand stability, proven reliability, and a very DevOps-oriented approach.\"\n\nAfter the switch, Polestar saw an immediate improvement in the performance of its on-site Configurator and web properties due to the Cloudflare China Network's partnership with China's largest Internet and cloud services provider, JD Cloud. The partnership provides Cloudflare clients with a geographically dispersed network presence in major cities across China to serve their static and dynamic content, and unrestricted access to Cloudflare serverless computing. \n\n\"With our previous vendor, everything was difficult to configure and troubleshoot,\" says Larsson. \"With Cloudflare, it just worked like magic. We instantly saw performance â€” our Chinese pages were as accessible as any other page, anywhere in the world.\"  \n\n\"Our most important gain in the move to Cloudflare China was the improvement across the board in predictability and stability. It always works,\" Vesavuori adds. \"On the customer side, that ability to deliver reliable technology ensures trust.\"\n\n### __A Super Bowl performant win with Workers and the Cloudflare global network__   \n\nIn addition to adopting the Cloudflare China Network, Polestar moved away from its underperforming cloud services and CDN  provider, switched to the Cloudflare global network for content delivery worldwide, and began web development using Cloudflare Workers serverless edge computing services.\n\nWhen it came to development, Polestar was able to rapidly migrate its entire micro-front-end architecture and applications to Workers, the Cloudflare serverless platform for running applications and code on the network edge. Cloudflare documentation, in addition to its strong online community and consultations, demos, and walkthroughs from proactive Cloudflare support teams further accelerated the transition. \n\nAnother win for the company was the ability to easily test its releases using Workers, a process Polestar previously found tedious and time-consuming. The time saved freed up Polestar's technical teams to focus on core business goals.   \n\n\"Workers was the most compatible with the tech we use to develop our applications â€” other vendor's solutions were abstracted in a way that made it difficult to get a sense of what would happen when we made changes,\" Larsson explains. \"Using Workers, we have granular control of everything and we can easily test to ensure our setup is correct before we release anything.\" \n\nOn the content delivery side, Polestar put the Cloudflare global network to the test when it aired the ['No Compromises'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QI0VzbkHk) commercial during Super Bowl 2022. The advertisement resulted in over 150,000 website visits â€” a traffic increase of almost 500 percent â€” in the two minutes after it aired. The site also saw an increase in long-tail traffic of around 15% for weeks following the tv commercial. \n\n\"Immediately after airing the Super Bowl commercial, viewers completed over 2000 configurations. We also saw a sales record for cars sold post event without fatal errors or us even flinching,\" says Vesavuori. \"Without Cloudflare as part of our core infrastructure, that could not have happened.\" \n\nWith 99.7% of its traffic served from the Cloudflare cache â€” up from a maximum of 80% percent with its previous providers â€” the Polestar network is faster and more resilient than ever. Cloudflare image resizing and optimization further lighten Polestar's bandwidth requirements, increase performance, and render its graphically-intensive website responsive on any device. \n\nLooking forward, Polestar intends to strengthen its partnership with Cloudflare and explore new services. The company is looking into Cloudflare Stream for its video storage, encoding, and adaptive bitrate playback, in addition to digging deeper into Workers KV, the Cloudflare edge key-value-data storage solution.\n\n\"Cloudflare is taking steps that disrupt the traditional marketplace. It's very interesting to follow their emerging services and figure out how they will improve our next generation of applications on the edge,\" says Larsson.\n\n\"Cloudflare is Polestar's twin in the sense they are innovating and disrupting classic software development, I think our continued relationship will be one of the keys to Polestar's success,\" adds Vesavuori.   \n\n---\n[1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2021/11/13/ev-share-of-china-passenger-car-market-more-than-tripled-to-nearly-19-in-october/?sh%3D104ff31b2c21&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1652516160991840&usg=AOvVaw2g4ebZTrSyGO52TpPwqGiK)\n",
