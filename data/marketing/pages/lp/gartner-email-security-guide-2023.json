						"copy": "As built-in security from Microsoft and Google has improved, threat actors are also getting more sophisticated — targeting end users with credential harvesters, malware, business email compromise, and other email-borne threats. With the shift to hybrid work, communication has also moved beyond just email with increased usage of collaboration and productivity applications. Attackers are using this as an opportunity for highly-evasive phishing attacks and malware distribution. \n\nThe 2023 Gartner® Market Guide for Email Security offers guidance for organizations to filter malicious content or suspicious interactions across multiple channels and prevent phishing attacks. \n\nSome of the market recommendations from the report include:\n- Look for email security solutions that use __ML- and AI-based anti-phishing technology__ for BEC protection to analyze conversation history to detect anomalies.\n- Ensure that the solution has __multifaceted protection for credential theft__, as well as __computer vision to analyze URLs__ that are impersonating common log-on pages.\n- Include API-based ICES solutions when evaluating email security solutions. __The simplicity of evaluation and additional visibility into internal traffic__ and other communication channels can reduce risk, as these solutions create communication graphs and baseline user activity to detect suspicious behavior.\n\n![2023 Gartner® Email Security Guide](//cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/7jvfFpVPcxOzHX51F2cKVh/605cce09c4d0a7c26dadaf0c059b817c/Simple-diagram-showing-inbound-email-coming-in-from-the-left_-through-a-secure-email-gateway-then-to-the-built-in-capabiliti.png)\n",
