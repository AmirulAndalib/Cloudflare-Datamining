All these information will help you build a complete media kit or take more assertive actions.\n\n## For e-commerces\n\nIf your focus is laid on conversion sales, besides accessing qualitative information about your audience you can build a personalized conversion funnel for your business, receive the visitors with exclusive offers and analyze that information to make strategic decisions.\n\n## For advertisers\n\nDoesn’t your website sell any product but buys media online?
