We found that most people (ourselves included!) had a hard time getting metrics about their API, and weren’t able to answer basic questions about its usage. With API Metrics in ReadMe, you can see which endpoints are the most popular, which ones aren’t used at all, where are your customers running into issues, who your biggest customers are, and much more.\n\nYou can also show users their own API Logs directly in the documentation. Show the specific API calls being made right in the reference section, making debugging and support as easy as possible.",
