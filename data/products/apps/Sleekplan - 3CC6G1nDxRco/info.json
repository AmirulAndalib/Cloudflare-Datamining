				"shortDescription": "All-in-one feedback widget for your website",
				"longDescription": "Sleekplan is a **customer feedback tool** that can easily be embedded in any web application. The widget assists you to track suggestions, ideas, and bugs from your customers, share a roadmap, and keep a changelog. Moreover, Sleekplan calculates an impact score to prioritize feedback automatically by using meaningful metrics. You don’t need to have a paid subscription from Sleekplan to use the feedback widget.\n\n## Some essential features:\n\n* Collect & manage feedback via an embedded widget\n* Measure and monitor customer satisfaction\n* Calculate an impact score based on meaningful metrics\n* Structure feedback with custom categories and statuses\n* Create a Roadmap\n* Keep a Changelog and notify customers\n* Get full control over the widget via the JavaScript SDK\n\n## The challenge\n\n**Listening to users is huge. It’s important.** But relying on the number of votes when making product decisions can be harmful. Consider that your largest customers‘ vote counts exactly the same as a person running a free trial. I decided to introduce an algorithm that calculates an impact score. The score is based on much more meaningful metrics (e.g. customer satisfaction, customer weighting, implementation effort).\n\n## How to get started\n\nSleekplan offers a free tier that can be used by anyone - free forever. If you are new to Sleekplan, you can try [Sleekplan Business](https://sleekplan.com/pricing) free for 30 days without any conditions - No credit card required. During the free trial, you will be able to use all of the Business.",
